C: (0.970%) T: @B52Malmet Inslee championed the cause, and he rallied more than a dozen candidates behind him, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former Vice President Joe Biden. A poll in June found 64% of Democratic-leaning voters supported the idea.
C: (1.000%) T: @graddy @slippish @spekulation @leftyaaron No, it’s called doing what an experienced politician thinks is how he can be most effective. Jay brought climate change to prominence in the primary, and is doing what he thinks will best keep that discussion going. Backing Elizabeth Warren at this time doesn’t do that.
C: (1.000%) T: @paulajean2020 @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren has. She has gone to the little towns, she listens to EVERYONE. She has clear well thought out plans. Her fanbase doesnt doxx people who dont like her. Bernie has refused to speak out against the large number of violent misogynists in his fanbase.
