C: (1.000%) T: @DGPurser Elizabeth Warren looks like she's deflating, just like her Presidential campaign.
C: (0.998%) T: @jgreene13 @ewarren Elizabeth Warren, before an exuberant rally in LA last night, got cheers for her plan to forgive college debt. #Warren2020 https://t.co/Z3pLaO71vJ
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren's campaign has spent $25,000 promoting this ad for 1.8 million impressions.    I think if it got more another 100 million clicks it would be just great.
C: (0.999%) T: This was being framed as some loony lefty idea yesterday by Very Serious People, but both Elizabeth Warren and the county’s largest union have signed onto it.  https://t.co/rSWoPrWw4E
C: (1.000%) T: She looks like a young Elizabeth Warren....how fitting! https://t.co/FHB6DiEeJ4
C: (1.000%) T: Definitely loving Elizabeth Warren's smarts, spirit, strength and snark! Though we have a couple of great candidates here in Texas that I love, I think the top of the ticket should be Warren. Glad to know I'm in such good company! #Warren2020 #VoteBlueNoMatterWho https://t.co/Cv8pqdeIXM

C: (0.995%) T: @BlakeAdcock2 @Love_Ova_Hate @CNN I agree. I carry Cherokee genes as I have resaerhed my lineage. Same as Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Lisa Simpson aka @ewarren, has a plan to fix this mess. She's getting my primary vote. The top 5 Dems all have their strengths, but it's my humble opinion that, Elizabeth Warren has better ideas &amp; strategies to deal with the current clusterf$#@! #Warren2020
C: (1.000%) T: #Biden is weak and out of date. #warren is the future https://t.co/vgN6LJZEoD
C: (1.000%) T: I watched Elizabeth Warren on CNN this evening. She's got great ideas &amp; plans to truly get corruption out of Government, use our Anti-trust laws, educate our children, &amp; proper healthcare, end Citizens United &amp; more. This is the 1st Presidential candidate I'm excited to vote for!
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @ewarren Omg!!! I’m sooo jealous!! Elizabeth Warren, you are one of my heroes!!!
C: (1.000%) T: If the Democrats such as Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren and liberal progressives are truly concerned about white nationalism, they should help Trump defund and shut down the white Supremacists at Planned Parenthood.  https://t.co/amdoKVCq5Q via @floppingaces
C: (0.999%) T: @Variety @briancgrubb Who's telling Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: Will Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren represent the democratic nominee?
C: (1.000%) T: @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Everything our @POTUS PRES TRUMP DOES MAKES SENSE.   i.e. Forgiving student loan  debt for disabledVeterans.  Everything DEMOCRATS  DO MAKES NO SENSE.  i. e. Forgiving all student loan debt amounting NOW to more than 1.57 trillion. https://t.co/68NxNMdx4h
C: (1.000%) T: Wealthy white liberals - who are disproportionately represented in mainstream media - have apparently chosen Elizabeth Warren to be their savior.  Hmm... https://t.co/Z2CgCKZzmu
C: (1.000%) T: listen i love bernie but he needs to step aside and let elizabeth warren do her thing
C: (0.998%) T: A concept: every time you give advice to someone, you have to give Elizabeth Warren two pennies. #YourTwoCents
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren was like “listen, I’m anticipating being pretty busy soon and I hate FOMO so could you just, wrap it up?” and when Elizabeth Warren asks you for something you do not deny her. https://t.co/pOCGRCosOc
C: (1.000%) T: After two and a half years of a proudly ignorant president, suddenly the smart older lady who’s thought of everything doesn’t seem like a schoolmarm who reminds you of your ex-wife anymore.  Suddenly, she was the most exciting thing in American politics. https://t.co/nF19hjmuJx
C: (1.000%) T: Is Elizabeth Warren trying (and succeeding) to fool natives again after earlier false claims of heritage? Are we so desperate to clasp onto any form of voice in the political arena that we overlook from within our own peoples? Hollywood has written this script before.
C: (1.000%) T: @trustrestored Elizabeth Warren "my faith animates all that I do"  Elizabeth Warren: "I'm doing the Lord's work" *Lame stream Media crickets chirp*
C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders 16.4 Trillion Bernie for a green deal I took another area against foreign domestic terrorists you Bernie Sanders our domestic terrace along with Elizabeth Warren you're trying to destroy America why why don't you 2 go find another  I fought for this country did you
C: (0.999%) T: @BreitbartNews You mean like Elizabeth Warren who faked being an Native American to get ahead and Hillary, the most corrupt politician of our time?
