C: (1.000%) T: @T_FisherKing @DrJasonJohnson I'm a white bernie supporter and I'm pretty online and I've never heard of her or that dumb tweet until just now. So calm down. And those policies that every dem has that helps are either Bernie's, Elizabeth Warren's, or stolen from them to sound good when running against them.
C: (1.000%) T: Jake Tapper: Do you agree with the notion that it was rigged?  Elizabeth Warren: Yes  You: Elizabeth Warren told no lies.  Get started on your HW lol https://t.co/74KusyBr7E
C: (1.000%) T: @MccomberJoan Of the mass shootings in recent weeks 1 was a socialist/communist Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren supporter &amp; the ElPaso shooter explained extensively he did NOT do what he did bcuz he supported Trump.

C: (1.000%) T: @AAinPDX @tallybroom @BronxDottie @NRA You are talking about faith while tweeting Elizabeth Warren? You're joking right? I suggest you get with those 50 or so followers and come up with better talking points

C: (1.000%) T: @GeorgeWill Americans and their misinterpretations of socialism make me laugh.  You always need a boogey man.   Trump is not expressing anything near socialism. He‚Äôs a greedy capitalist who wants all of it - for himself. He‚Äôs a plunderer.  Elizabeth Warren wants to equal the playing field.

C: (1.000%) T: @davidaxelrod @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump You know what, David. You're not as sharp as you used to be. Joe has a certain amount of Teflon at this point. No one's looking for perfection out of Joe - just the ability to beat Trump. Don't be dumb. Elizabeth Warren's great mentally, but she doesn't appeal at the gut.
C: (0.999%) T: Yet on this 5th Anniversary, the lies are being spread again by many people, including by presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, who falsely claim Brown was murdered. @ewarren @SenWarren @KamalaHarris  y'all kniw better or may be ur just both STUPID

C: (1.000%) T: @CivilizedDebate I am not exited. Find all the candidates likable but ‚Äúexited‚Äù about none. Of the lot, prefer Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.520%) T: @KamalaHarris @tammytabby It‚Äôs sick that these so-called ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù lawyers Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren both spew out the word ‚Äúmurder‚Äù of Michael Brown when the policeman was totally exonerated by Obama‚Äôs Justice Dept. under Eric Holder.   They have both slandered and libeled the policeman.
