C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren- in this case you're doing a disservice to policeman across the country. The DOJ investigated and concurred that Michael Brown attacked the officer.  Please retract this and pick another person for pandering.
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidCornDC Yes actually I can, Elizabeth Warren&gt; She is the type of person I grew up around. Educated, and not about to be fooled by cooperate America. She is every great teacher I have ever had the opportunity to learn from. I have never been around a born wealthy, never had a job fool.

C: (1.000%) T: @GauravNivsarkar @billmaher I think he “feels” that a lot. I watch his show. Sometimes he makes good points (like everything about Trump) but he has a misogyny problem and he doesn’t recognize/acknowledge white privilege.  Elizabeth Warren is a far better candidate than Biden. She just is.

C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN You know what both of those things have on common, they are both evil and you know what, you so ply can't stop evil, it's inevitable. The truth of the matter is that no one here wants white nationalists to shoot up places and no one here wants liberal Elizabeth warren supporters
