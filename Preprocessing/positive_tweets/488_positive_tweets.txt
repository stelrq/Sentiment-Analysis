C: (0.521%) T: @lauracosta_13 @mcspocky @Walmart And the Dayton shooter supported Bernie&amp; Elizabeth Warren so let’s ban them too
C: (1.000%) T: Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%. https://t.co/9UyeMBMhbw
C: (0.942%) T: @ewh2m @ClistonBrown Well considering she is competitive with Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren all of which are household names while Kamala is still introducing herself speaks volumes. She's been on an overall trend up and in a year should could be our nominee.
C: (0.940%) T: @WalshFreedom When white cops murder African Americans it is always seen as justifiable.  Elizabeth Warren isn’t lying; you are just being wilfully blind.
C: (1.000%) T: A 'laissez faire' approach to globalism and outsourcing is not appropriate, as Senator Elizabeth Warren has recently propounded. Democrats would do well to embrace moderate protectionism for American jobs.
C: (1.000%) T: Hmmm other shooter was a leftist all about Elizabeth Warren....weird how the media buried that one but gladly posted about the other shooter and how we need to bring down Trump....it's all a game wake up people they just want to divide eveyone
C: (0.999%) T: Over the past few years we have watched several Democratic Presidential Candidates do this very thing,  Spin, Lie, spin more.  The lies they tell are outrageous....Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren being two of the very worst. https://t.co/7PIIWKX7H1
C: (0.986%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a plan to reduce gun deaths by 80% https://t.co/gjsAfoYJo0
C: (1.000%) T: @SRuhle @MikeBloomberg @ewarren @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren has better chance
C: (1.000%) T: I agree. An Elizabeth Warren/Joe Biden ticket would be good. Keep him as a vice presidential candidate if you have to. I am voting democrat no matter what but I do not think Biden as the Presidential choice is the wisest https://t.co/yfLYCSbSD1
C: (0.988%) T: @CBSNews Oh yea, Bernie... Media Ignores How Dayton Shooter Was Liberal Who Supported Pro-Abortion Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders
C: (1.000%) T: @Boss_Dogg69 @LessGovMoreFun @SteveScalise His manifesto is the best source to see his motivations. We don't have such info on the Dayton shooter who was a Elizabeth Warren fan &amp; Antifa supporter. I'm sure your mind wont be changed, you appear to be set in your view of Trump as evil. But, have a nice day anyway. Peace.
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr Did you just lecture Elizabeth warren on the real world? That’s a hoot coming from a trust fund kid who never worked a blue collar job in his life, who never had to live paycheck to paycheck or worry about losing their home. Sit the fuck down.
C: (0.989%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a new plan to reduce gun violence by 80 percent https://t.co/EzijvrctQU via @voxdotcom
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr Like you have ever had to "do anything in the real world"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 By the way, her name is Elizabeth Warren. Your insulting nicknames give you no power, they just show what a POS you are.
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps Elizabeth Warren has a Katharine Hepburn kind of spirit. Honest, full of ideas, energy, enthusiasm with an athletic body language.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren This is a lie Elizabeth Warren. He was shot by Darren Wilson in  an act of self defense. The grand jury did not indict him, for any charge .Why are you lying like this? The same reason you called yourself an American Indian, it was convienant?
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr Junior is arguing policy with Elizabeth Warren and starts out with a little name calling....FAIL! OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE JUNIOR! LOL SAD! https://t.co/fj3K2H4gZg
C: (1.000%) T: When Elizabeth Warren is president this nation can finally begin to heal. A long, long road again but at least we have a chance at a new beginning to make things right, to end the hate of fascism &amp; white supremacy that is Trump/GOP/NRA. https://t.co/wkoHmfPtwr
C: (1.000%) T: @Ange_Amene Now that Warren is second place in polls, the paid trolls are busy bombarding social media w anything negative abt Warren.  Don’t fall for this crap. They only want Trump to win by weakening a strong opponent.  That’s what they did to Hillary.  https://t.co/K4wfqLuUGy
C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren I wouldn't want to be seen with Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @PaulLeeTicks @DonaldJTrumpJr It is pretty funny.   Elizabeth Warren is an elected U.S. Senator.  Sadly, the @GOP now on @DonaldJTrumpJr (who not so long ago was an apolitical Democrat, IIRC) as a spokesperson, even tho he has no credentials or experience in policy-making.
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC Wow Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren got BLOOD all over there hand as well.
C: (1.000%) T: @BuxMontNews Here’s another crazy one. Elizabeth Warren stated Michael Brown was “murdered” by a “white” policeman. Something we all know if flatly false. Not one major journalistic outlet has run a story covering it. As someone in journalism, I’d love to hear your thoughts.
C: (0.577%) T: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders call for Walmart to stop selling guns, as workers protest the retail giant in the aftermath of deadly shootings in stores https://t.co/D6YSCXE1KT
