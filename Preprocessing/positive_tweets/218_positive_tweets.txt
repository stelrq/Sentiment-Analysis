C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 What ever you say doctor. Are you related to Elizabeth  Warren? She lied and said she was a Native American to get a Grant into Harvard and cheated some Native American out of their College Grant She should pay it back.
C: (1.000%) T: @AndyOstroy @soulcycle The shooter in Dayton was a hardcore Elizabeth Warren supporter. It has been found that the shooter in El Paso was a registered Democrat.

C: (0.989%) T: @BillKristol I deserve Elizabeth Warren and our country deserves Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @sairasameerarao No. Donald Trump isn‚Äôt all of us, just like Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt every Indian *snicker* , Kanye West isn‚Äôt every black man, George Lopez isn‚Äôt very Latino. Don‚Äôt be so ignorant. And, by the way, it‚Äôs laughable to play the racist card so hard when Russia failed...please...
