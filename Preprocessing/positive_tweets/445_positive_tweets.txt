C: (1.000%) T: @RWPUSA @ProudResister @ewarren @JoeBiden @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren doesn't have to be polite like Hillary felt she had to during debates. She would have him flustered so easily. Can you imagine him throwing down the mic and walking away? ðŸ˜‚

C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris I think the Obama d.o.j. and Eric Holder found different but keep throwing this out there, since Elizabeth Warren used it too.
C: (1.000%) T: @realSteveAlex @Zaphods50 @nprpolitics it's hilarious that the guy who could not show me any evidence that Elizabeth Warren lied about her heritage or used it to get ahead in life, is tell me I need more evidence.
C: (1.000%) T: @jentaub @BrianKarem @Politidope @realDonaldTrump Who will free the GOP .. indeed?  I know: Elizabeth Warren; that's who.  Then, with Trump in exile in Moscow, the NRA and GOP can disband and - yes - Make America ... you know.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren @ewarren Weâ€™re going to win in 2020 by getting organized at the grassroots levelâ€”like at our house party in Des Moines on Sunday. Democracy starts in our backyards! Traducido del inglÃ©s al https://t.co/ob05c7VgzA

C: (1.000%) T: @mgnbnntt Elizabeth Warren ainâ€™t the only candidate with plans, and Kirsten Gillibrand is the one with the right one for that  https://t.co/RtQqnHb7tV
C: (1.000%) T: @RWPUSA @ewarren @JoeBiden @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren is the best and the most electable candidate by far.
C: (1.000%) T: @samstein I'm voting for Elizabeth Warren.  Hopefully both in the primary and the general election.
C: (1.000%) T: Is it just me, or does this George Will piece not make any sense? I've really got no idea what he's trying to say. Warren as crypto-Trumpist is my best guess, I guess?   https://t.co/cGho73pmLZ
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren making gains in the battleground state of Iowa. Warren now leading Sanders and Harris and is trailing Biden by just 9 points.   The ultra-liberal Senatorâ€™s support in Iowa is up more than 12% in only 4 months.  https://t.co/UV4prRGtpq
C: (1.000%) T: Letâ€™s make gun ownership so expensive that â€œthe people â€œ say screw itðŸ¤¬ Thatâ€™s their plan.

C: (0.986%) T: @IlhanMN The Dayton shooter was a socialist Elizabeth Warren supporter. Shut the fuck up.
C: (1.000%) T: She is just unbelievable. But Iâ€™ll tell you somethingâ€¦ sheâ€™s good at her job. She knows how to twist words and actions to sound credible to her base. But to the rest of us, sheâ€™s just a big ball of hate mongering bullshit. Goddamn her and her fucking... https://t.co/akot4x6ODM
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 He also loves Satan and is in a band that glorifies rape. The Elizabeth Warren thing seems like a red herring. We donâ€™t know the Dayton shooterâ€™s motives, but he did kill his sister.
C: (0.731%) T: @JohnWHuber @nklongmire Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don't incite violence at their rallies.  Your point?
