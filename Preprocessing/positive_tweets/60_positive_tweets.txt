C: (1.000%) T: Don't you feel guilty knowing that YOUR WORDS inspired the Dayton Ohio shooter?  He said "I'd be happy to vote for Elizabeth Warren."  He believed the HATE you were spewing. https://t.co/nlnUXrHPWr
C: (0.985%) T: 'Creepy' Bob Mueller, 'Sleepy' Elizabeth Warren, and 'Creepy' Michael Cohen hate me.  Republicans will stand strong. Sad!
C: (1.000%) T: @DREDD_48 I‚Äôd be willing to bet you my house it ain‚Äôt Joe Biden. Or Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or Pete Buttigieg for that matter.   She strikes me as a ‚ÄúKeep America Great‚Äù 2020 type of gal.   #MAGA

C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Then should Elizabeth Warren step down?  A man killed 9 people in her name in Dayton. No one claiming to worship Satan and adore Tucker Carlson has killed anyone. You might want to check yourself.
C: (1.000%) T: Analogy is not your strong suit. The difference is the Dayton killer didn't post a manifesto that echoed Elizabeth Warren's stump speech. I'm surprised Trump hasn't sued the El Paso killer for plagiarism.... https://t.co/dA0FSVpQro
C: (0.987%) T: @s500rick @GOP @DNC @CNN @fox5ny @realDonaldTrump I agree! So is Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @DemocracyStorm @ShawnInArizona @ShawnInArizona has a track record of making a difference, the smallest example is the buttons he had made &amp; distributes for Elizabeth Warren for her town hall here in PHX. He walks it like he talks it and that is inspiring, got me out canvassing. Keep it up Shawn.
C: (1.000%) T: @wookieecode @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN Your tweet for example, blaming Trump supporters for a mass shooting when the most recent mass shooting was by a liberal Elizabeth Warren supporter.  You have no self awareness.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Using the logic of Democrats, i.e. Trump is responsible for El Paso shootings, then Bernie Sanders is responsible for Steve Scalise shooting, Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton shooting and the entire Democratic caucus is responsible for all deaths related to illegals.
C: (0.995%) T: @TruthcastersTv @sethmoulton @SawyerHackett @Castro4Congress You do understand there's a difference between legal and illegal immigration right?  And the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @ssach7 @kjblank80 @elderofziyon @benshapiro @cjwerleman @jdforward CNN reports that Betts had expressed support for left-wing causes on his Twitter account,whichwas handle @iamthespookster: supporting Sens.Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,as well as posts against ICE agents,and multiple posts condemning police,and supporting Antifa protesters
C: (1.000%) T: @frankm2724 @GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump Except own was a fkn radical leftist  who hates trump and loves Elizabeth warren. üòíüòíüòíüòí don‚Äôt be a retard you‚Äôre whole life. Especially when you have a choice to actually be informed and educate yourself and use facts to form opinions instead of regurgitating the bullshit.
C: (1.000%) T: @Cathy45836270 @RyanAFournier The Dayton shooters beliefs and the fact he supports Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt the issue. The issue is mental health care and stronger background checks. Don‚Äôt cherry pick your facts Cathy! Grow up
C: (0.988%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI What about the people who support Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Antifa? KAG 2020
C: (0.995%) T: @WalshFreedom Deranged Dayton Ohio shooter was a Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporter so what does that make them?

C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Maxine Waters and Leticia James got the goods from Deutsche Bank! Puzzle pieces coming together! Elizabeth Warren is the ONE for 2020!
C: (1.000%) T: @AnnCoulter Just You Tube Michael Brown and watch, all your answers and you will realize how far from reality Elizabeth Warren really is.  [Drop the mic]
C: (0.995%) T: I love Elizabeth Warren.   #MedicareForAll #GreenNewDeal #Justice https://t.co/hCOikXd9Of
C: (1.000%) T: @lancearmstrong 1) This is like Tom Brady bragging that he can throw a football better than Elizabeth Warren   2) Pence would‚Äôve blown past you if you weren‚Äôt juicing
C: (0.988%) T: Note  No one believes  Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren killed #EpsteinMurder
C: (0.532%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren you're an idiot. That thug got exactly what he had coming and not a minute too soon.
C: (1.000%) T: Bloomberg sasses Elizabeth Warren for digs on one percent https://t.co/YNe3m3c33i
C: (1.000%) T: @NateSilver538 Why wouldn‚Äôt that person just be Elizabeth Warren?  She‚Äôs repeatedly said she‚Äôs not an enemy of capital. I fully expect the party elites to start backing her as Biden keeps flubbing.
