C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/SxV9LUQ0wo  Good on Warren for renouncing ‚Äúfirst use‚Äù of nukes. But on the 73d anniversary of Hiroshima/Nagasaki, it is worth noting that of more than 200 countries on planet earth, the US is the only one logically unqualified to proclaim such a policy.
C: (1.000%) T: @LarrySchweikart @alllibertynews @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump Amazing how conservatives forgot about El Paso in less then 24 hrs. Im sure their thoughts and prayers are with the people of Toledo. Side note. What Elizabeth Warren rallies did the Dayton shooter attend to get him all wound up? Or was it her twitter feed?
