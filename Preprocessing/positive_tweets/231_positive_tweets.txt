C: (1.000%) T: Brit calls it as he sees it and he calls Warren and Harris LIARS.  When you compare their relative statements with facts, it is undeniably true, especially in this instance. #DemocratLies https://t.co/gMBUUK1hI7
C: (1.000%) T: That would be interesting to see. Mind telling that to Elizabeth warren, Kamala Harris, Nancy Peloski. They seem to thing that demon rats should get up in peoples faces and harass them in public. Red Hen ring any bells? https://t.co/0eUafK6GUo
C: (1.000%) T: @ChiTownSam723 @KamalaHarris Not smart as to who can best put Trump in his place. I love Bernie + his agenda but powerful forces will not let him be president. I’m not sure about Elizabeth Warren (corporate forces are afraid of her) but Kamala has It + that’s what we need now, not ideological purity.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Plans to Tax Americans Out of Their Second Amendment Rights  https://t.co/PxUjx0lSFL I am sure every pimp, drug dealer and gang banger will eagerly want to do this. Enforce existing gun laws strictly Ms Warren if you are serious about curbing gun violence.
C: (1.000%) T: That moment it hits you that you're tweet-thread earlier about Elizabeth Warren demonizing the Walmart heirs was inspired by @StephenGutowski talking about Olive Garden.  Twitter's freaking weird, man.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is also spreading lies today, she is lying about our city Saint Louis and what happened to Mike Brown, why does she get by with this? https://t.co/MaZtvwN1un https://t.co/C4ZqY766zS
C: (1.000%) T: @delusionalcons I think it's a thinly veiled racist thing where prominent dems (the squad,  Bernie, Elizabeth Warren) aren't white, Christian, Male. (Squad are all women minorities, Bernie is a Jew, Elizabeth a woman with native heritage) or something about communism/socialism

C: (1.000%) T: @AgnosticNinja @AriannW @mindswide If you are interested in indigeneity, the Native Americans have had to deal with this in a very real way in their homeland for centuries. It's worth reading where they're at with it. https://t.co/Y2XloXtS7v

C: (1.000%) T: @jwpetersNYT @brianstelter @nytimes You conspicuously forget to mention the Dayton shooter the proud  Elizabeth Warren disciple &amp; environmentalist. As a matter of fact the El Paso shooter was looking for free universal healthcare. Integrity much?
C: (0.984%) T: @GovBillWeld  And is the other mass shooting that just happened is that because of Elizabeth  because he was in Elizabeth Warren voter.
