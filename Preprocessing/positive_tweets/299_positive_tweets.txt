C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I wa asked today who is Elizabeth Warren I said damned if I know
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is blatantly lying here for political gain  Michael Brown was not "murdered" by Darren Wilson https://t.co/fvQbEgLPeq
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‘murdered by a white police officer’ https://t.co/z6cIrJjfNm via @twitchyteam
C: (0.960%) T: @UtahGunGuy @SawyerHackett @JoeNBC Show me one video of Elizabeth Warren talking about invasions, infestations, Mexican murderers  and  ranting hate.  I will be waiting
C: (1.000%) T: @SESKILL @drmikehawke @ewarren @Cernovich Also you realize Elizabeth Warren is literally white correct? And a US citizen? She wants healthcare for all Americans, to improve education for Americans, etc. "Anti-Patriot" points are weak when her policies are built to help. Have evidence and solid points before rambling.
C: (0.998%) T: @TrumpWarRoom No news station has said Elizabeth Warren is responsible for ot Ohio shooting!,, But all to quick to blame The People's President,  Donald J Trump! Trump controls the weather! Insane shooters! The world economy! Scares the shit outta most folks by putting the  American people 1st
C: (0.667%) T: @citizenchuckd @Rockprincess818 So one person represents everyone conservative? Does that mean the Elizabeth Warren supporter who shot up Dayton, or Bernie supporter who shot up a ball game represent all on the left? Good to know, if so.
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis What happened in Ohio can clearly be laid at Elizabeth Warren’s feet. She encouraged people. She created the climate. She fanned the flames.  That’s how we play this game, right?    #Hypocrite #Liar
C: (0.590%) T: His exploitation of this tragedy for political gain. You should be ashamed of yourself supporting that doofus, Mika. The victims aren't even in the ground yet. And the left is exploiting it. Elizabeth Warren fund raising off the dead. It's not only despicable, it's pure  evil. https://t.co/xy0r6bNR3p
C: (0.988%) T: @iamcardib Yes indeed. One was a Democrat following ANTIFA AND ELIZABETH WARREN
C: (0.987%) T: @CNN The Dayton shooter supported Antifa and Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @rpdandy @realDonaldTrump BS. If that's the kind of logic you want to use, Elizabeth Warren is why the Dayton shooter pulled the trigger.
C: (0.987%) T: Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/Dl64JTfFLy via @washtimes
C: (1.000%) T: @RepMaxineWaters Pssttt....dayton shooter was an antifa supporting democrat who like Elizabeth Warren....the NRA has killed no one.
C: (1.000%) T: "...Williamson received 68.7 million TV impressions, which was just behind the 230 million for Sen. Elizabeth Warren ..."  New math?  https://t.co/B1LCoabelp
C: (0.987%) T: @isitthisaisle @CBSNews Racist?  He supported Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and opposed ICE.  https://t.co/JoDgoEnRWn
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN Interesting how you fail to mention that the Dayton, Ohio shooter was a far left Democrat and an Elizabeth Warren supporter.    Whites don't want to rule over other races. That's the def of white supremacy. How can you be this out of touch with reality?
C: (0.924%) T: @KatherineWolfr2 @whereisjustice0 He said he was a Lefty Socialist who wanted to cut holes in the border walls &amp; fences. He also was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. So using that Mayor’s ignorant thought process this is ALL Warren’s fault!
C: (0.960%) T: @KamalaHarris It breaks my heart that these nine people will never see their families again on this planet because one of Elizabeth Warren’s fans (a radical leftist) decided to kill them.   #MentalIllness
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr Looks like we just need to do some background checks on Elizabeth Warren's supporters to find the next mass shooter!!
C: (0.993%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr If we go by that reasoning, THE SHOOTER WAS A SUPPORTER OF ELIZABETH WARREN &amp; SOCIALISM @AOC HE WAS A LEFT WING EXTREMIST! The left is responsible for inciting hate &amp; violence
C: (1.000%) T: @paulkrugman No mention of the ANTIFA-supporting, self-described socialist and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporting Dayton shooter.  No acknowledgement of democrats using identity politics.  No acknowledgement of rampant inner city violence.  None of that exists in Krugman world.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepAdamSchiff @fred_guttenberg It was just released that the El Paso shooter was very upset after the Democrat debate. He was a Democrat. The Dayton shooter was a Democrat and would either vote 4 Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and supported antifa. Are you a white supremacy leader Adam?
C: (1.000%) T: @seanhannity You say we shouldn’t blame Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooter but a lot of people think she should be. Fair is fair. Sometimes taking the “high road” is no more than showing weakness and is cowardly. It is time to fight Leftist fire with fire. Grow a pair.
C: (1.000%) T: Oh well. Omar committing immigration fraud by marrying her brother, text fraud campaign finance fraud what about Camellia Harris lying to the people saying that she was subjugated that she did not go to school on a school bus with white people what about Elizabeth Warren lying on https://t.co/hx4Z3WvNvJ
