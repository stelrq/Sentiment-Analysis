C: (1.000%) T: @jhawk6229 @Noble_Avocado I like Warren's book because it addresses systemic flaws and personal psychology. It's a better book than his. But by mentioning Elizabeth Warren, you'd have thought I'd burned a Bible by the way the Army of Rage came after me
C: (1.000%) T: @cbjm1972 @Nyadnar17 @TianaTheFirst I didn't say anything about what Elizabeth Warren would or wouldn't do. Just that there is no way the GOP would support anything she did even if they actually did support it
