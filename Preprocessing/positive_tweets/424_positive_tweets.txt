Example: cancel all college debt. Has anyone considered the harm to companies who loaned the money? If I loan, I expect repayment.

C: (1.000%) T: @Joytoworld93 @FaceTheNation @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Did Trump motivate the lifelong-Democrat Elizabeth Warren-supporting Dayton shooter too?  Why did the El Paso shooter specifically say in his manifesto that it has nothing to do with Trump?  Are these questions you've even bothered to ask yourself?
C: (1.000%) T: @RahadJax @Silver_Spyder @danm4n @DebtCrisisOrg That's why Elizabeth Warren's plan seems the most sensible: 2% tax on wealth over $50MM.  Spoiler alert: you don't have $50 million, so you don't need to worry about it. üëç

C: (1.000%) T: @HNTurtledove I know. It puts Bernie supporters in an awkward position...but there's not many other good candidates put there,  and we're running out of time. Maybe vote for Elizabeth Warren?  Biden can eff right off, though.
C: (0.995%) T: @ewarren No wonder the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter https://t.co/Bc7m9ZCKBc
C: (0.993%) T: @SharylAttkisson Elizabeth Warren knows that but she doesn‚Äôt care...  She KNOWS that MB was a shiit bag felon that didn‚Äôt GAF about anybody except himself.  He was rabid street thug that was put down while trying to kill a PO.  She‚Äôs just pandering the black vote like all good Democrats.
