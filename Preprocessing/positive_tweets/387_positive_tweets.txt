C: (0.993%) T: Despite what Elizabeth Warren and other lying Democrats said, Michael Brown was not “murdered.” He was a thug who, after robbing a convenient store, hit a police officer in the face and reached inside the car to grab the officer’s gun.

C: (1.000%) T: #MyBernieStory Elizabeth Warren has the same agenda as Bernie, but actually has a plan to implement it. Plus she stands with Planned Parenthood and didn't blame the mentally ill for mass shootings. I'm done with old white men, its time to step aside.

C: (1.000%) T: Yes, I understand how the electoral college works.   And I am pretty sure that whoever the nominee is *cough* Elizabeth Warren *cough* will learn from the mistakes Hillary made.   My point is, a woman is absolutely electable and don’t take shit from anyone who says otherwise.
C: (0.526%) T: You are right. Several of these terrorist have been inspired by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth warren.  When will they stop their divisive rhetoric? https://t.co/ssoobmOWyB

I don't love those fat cats, but ... she was in a rigorous fervor about drugs. That can't be good.

C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano YES! I loathe Bernie, but if he's the nominee, I'll vote for him.  So glad his support is being siphoned off by Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @LATBermudez @olivasdan But he was Democrat, spurned by Elizabeth Warren. You’re missing that key fact which means this whole tweet is fake news. Just like you #FakeNewsLatinos trying to rewrite our culture to fit the Left’s narrative. #ThereIsNoChicanX #ThereIsNoLatinX #LatinOPride #LatinosPorTrump2020

C: (1.000%) T: @AtassiZaher @SpaghettiKozak Sanders is a hero to rational,moral leftists.  Preferring Warren *and* Biden makes zero sense &amp; is irrational. Sanders &amp; Warren are pretty close both as good progressives, while Warren &amp; Biden are different/adversaries.  https://t.co/wR6Syextp3  (Harris &amp; Buttigieg suck too btw.)
C: (1.000%) T: Those idiots troll types stick their heads out to be swept up in information gathering. FYI. The ‘other’ shooter was a Far Left Extremist who supported Elizabeth Warren. He posted on mainstream media. https://t.co/cJGLRBuo1Z

C: (1.000%) T: @jvannn1399 @kreativekonnect @daviddoel I disagree. We have Bernie and Elizabeth Warren. Their policies are not the same but they are both great candidates. I think we saw that during the last debate.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is a native American demagogue. I said No and Yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @NanticokeRep @Ange_Amene “This supports the two critical charges against her: that she knowingly and personally claimed Native American heritage, and that she did so for the purpose of career advancement.” https://t.co/09FM7QIieT
