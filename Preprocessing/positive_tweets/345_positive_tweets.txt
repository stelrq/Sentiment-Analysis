C: (0.997%) T: @Ange_Amene Oh, that’s why she had so many more votes than Bernie. This is truly crap to say at this point! So disappointed at Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.906%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr @NRA Elizabeth Warren and the rest of her clan are just looking for other loopholes or avenues to take guns away. The Dem’s are always looking for a way to hurt someone that doesn’t agree with them or there New radical idea of America which is, it’s destruction and no bill of rights.
C: (0.985%) T: "Attempts to contact Senator Warren’s campaign by phone and email were not returned." Elizabeth Warren’s Ferguson Lie https://t.co/dYM0pWdliL
C: (1.000%) T: @brithume Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are irresponsible in propogating this lie, that Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer. Do they not remember it was the Obama DOJ that cleared the officer? Warren and Harris are no better than that race baiter Al Sharpton.
C: (0.900%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren really! So Michael Brown didn't strong arm the innocent convenience store owner before he charged a police officer and cause his own demise. You're known for a pathological liar over half the damn country knows.
C: (1.000%) T: @shawna_burley @sfguy1818 @KamalaHarris “She’s a bad person”. Ok. Think about that for a bit. Then think again. You can agree or disagree with her political tactics.  But zero credible actually empathetic humans would call Elizabeth Warren a... as you say... Bad Person.
C: (1.000%) T: @Josh_Gere @StewardshipAmer @worldgoneweirde @AOC The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. The El Paso shooter while a white supremacist was a socialist, he wanted the free stuff Dems offer just didn't want to share with illegals. He was triggered by Dem debate not Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: @Meghan_BB_ @NathanHRubin What you say about Biden is true. Elizabeth Warren has radically changed and her actual voting record and policies while she served in office are extremely progressive as are Bernie Sanders, who was an Independent.
C: (1.000%) T: @OhNoIts2016 @WajahatAli I think there should be a combination of all 3. Elizabeth Warren has the smarts to run the country &amp; Trump knows it. I think Harris has the smarts &amp; strength but so does Booker as VP’s. No I don’t give a shit about her ancestry, I care about who can fix this mess Trump has done.
C: (1.000%) T: @dbongino Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are idiots!! They believe they can change climate change! It's not a man made! You can change it!!
C: (1.000%) T: @JamesEd23504482 @NobamaDotCom @KAG4All Mongo speaks the real truth! Elizabeth Warren is a  #LIAR!!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants the same federal government that couldn’t keep Jeffrey Epstein alive to run your healthcare, Red Flag laws, and pretty much every major sector of the economy.
C: (0.989%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren failed to mention that the Dayton shooter supported her and Antifa.  Dishonest Democrats are attempting to divert attention away from the sick values of Democrats by using excuses such as:  NRA, mental health, white nationalist.
C: (0.985%) T: The plan would raise taxes on guns and ammunition by up to 80% https://t.co/sfysoR8GGn
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris KAMALA HARRIS, ELIZABETH WARREN &amp; the DNC did not pull the trigger in DAYTON, but they are not EXONERATED.  They appear aligned with DAYTON KILLER
C: (0.978%) T: @MitchPileggi1 @ewarren Wait a minute @MitchPileggi1 ... are you a shit heel gun nut? And worse anti Elizabeth Warren? I need answers.
C: (1.000%) T: i understand that i'm 20 years old and a legal adult but can Elizabeth Warren adopt me
C: (0.927%) T: In a gloomy political time, with a humorless sociopathic bully in the White House, and with all the worst impulses of the national Id come out to play, Senator Professor Warren is the campaign's happy warrior."  https://t.co/KIICK7ECWI
C: (1.000%) T: @TBeto777 The confusion probably lies in the fact you go by Beto but use a picture of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.985%) T: me reading people’s stories about what elizabeth warren says to them https://t.co/Jyd8eCZCCQ
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris @ewarren You're a f****** joke Kamala Harris and so is Elizabeth Warren,If Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren become president of the United States God help us all, Kamala Harris is a phony person right along with Elizabeth Warren,
C: (0.544%) T: I'm going to vote for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.997%) T: @InternetHippo Fellow Bernie stans, do like Bernie does and focus your fire on these people, not Elizabeth Warren
