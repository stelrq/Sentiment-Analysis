C: (1.000%) T: @RottenRepublica @SenSchumer Don't read much! One of the shooters was a staunch Liberal Socialist and an admirer of Liar-In-Chief, Elizabeth Warren. Have you heard her hateful, despicable rhetoric. Furthermore! There should be some accountability for opportunistic lie, used to secure a teaching position. https://t.co/QdGljQWAR3
C: (1.000%) T: #Breaking Sources with FBI and Dayton Ohio indicate NO CLEAR Political Motivation for Dayton Shooting's. Don't indicate ties to Antifa or Elizabeth Warren. Note comment from WXIX reporter Tricia Macke when asked about supposed left leaning Motive. https://t.co/JFpPsOvTuX
C: (1.000%) T: @mj_lee @KristenOrthman She did not denounce Left-wing extremism. Left-wing terrorists are a threat to this country, &amp; she did not denounce them. This-according to ‚Äúthe rules‚Äù-makes Elizabeth Warren a Left-wing extremist, as well as every single one of her supporters. We‚Äôre not having 2 sets of rules.
C: (0.994%) T: @CecileRichards @AOC So what‚Äôs your opinion of this self proclaimed, leftist, atheist, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders fan?  https://t.co/CAgyLZuiXb
C: (0.532%) T: The weekend after Elizabeth Warren supporters kill 10 people in Dayton then threaten Mitch McConnell outside his DC home Castro pulls this. https://t.co/aomvRD5J8T
C: (1.000%) T: @JoyceWhiteVance Um, the Dayton  shooter was a committed socialist, and fan of Elizabeth Warren....so.....
C: (0.985%) T: HAHHAHAHAH @TheBabylonBee Is phenomenal. #Warren2020  "Elizabeth Warren Claims Two Men In Colonial Outfits Assaulted Her With Smallpox-Infested Blankets." https://t.co/qOEyAF6rrn
C: (0.994%) T: @Nick_Clamorgan @matosortho @ewarren today I was asking if Elizabeth Warren was an American Indian‚Ä¶ I said no!!!
C: (1.000%) T: Please impress it on Susan Sarandon that Joe Biden's age, gaffes and past legislative history is unimportant.  The only important thing at this moment is that he can beat THE TRAVESTY.  If he wins, he will have to choose Elizabeth Warren as VP.  She's better than Bernie, Susan.
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery I think you're biased. I find Elizabeth Warren to be incredibly genuine, and very caring. Same with Klobuchar oh, and Cory Booker, and pretty much the rest of the democratic field. Why do you think your side has all the earmarks of genuine behavior?
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery Cory Booker. Elizabeth Warren. Pete Buttigieg. Like him or not, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.  Maybe you‚Äôre not taking a real look at the Democratic field.
C: (0.995%) T: @Viper1jcm @BadGuy209 @HCSOSheriff @accordingtomio 1 out of 60million, you're going to have to try harder... Dayton shooter was an atheist socialist Elizabeth Warren fan if you wanna go down that road.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/jcYaxGmavO via @twitchyteam
C: (1.000%) T: @greta Your handwriting is pretty good with that sharpie.  Looks like your notes are on Christopher Steele, Fusion GPS, and something on Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano I agree. Elizabeth Warren is the smartest candidate in the entire field. Joe is old and well past relevance and ability.
C: (1.000%) T: If you don't share the ownership, nobody will care to see it your way. If the masses have no skin in the game, they don't care. Capitalist greed is self-destructing. You have no friends! https://t.co/lrIKVO1XUc
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a white supremacist. I said yes. What is more supreme than to usurp Indian heritage to gain access and position for oneself? Very supremacist actions! üßê
C: (1.000%) T: There are really good reasons to like Elizabeth Warren, and people are catching on! https://t.co/QXXSL8gcxw
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is pledging to stand with all the victims in the United States. Do you want a president who stand against all? All the legal system made the determination. You are being played for your vote, so she can go onto sympathizing with the next victim.
C: (1.000%) T: @RashidaTlaib One thing I don't understand is why are u calling yourself "women of color". Arabs are white. Both your parents are of Arab descent. That makes you white as well. Or maybe you are like Elizabeth Warren Pokahontas?
C: (0.922%) T: @brithume Brit, Senator Elizabeth Warren is a science denier. She needs to be sued for slander. Darren Wilson is in hiding for fear of his life.
C: (0.985%) T: Young enthusiasm for Elizabeth Warren in Clear Lake for theDemocratic Wing Ding. https://t.co/o9dmyGRNsq
C: (1.000%) T: @SailorRage @mtaibbi Referring to Elizabeth Warren as "Wall Street" Warren just highlights how you're out of touch with reality.
C: (0.542%) T: Ok Mr. DNA, I guess you're going the Elizabeth Warren route. Remind me again, what was it. 1/1024th. https://t.co/P2kNsgpeCv
C: (0.997%) T: @laura_lrnzo Yes, and in this case a dishonest and incredibly irresponsible misuse, even before I also bring in the fact that she is a lawyer who knows better. Elizabeth Warren is a very bad person.
