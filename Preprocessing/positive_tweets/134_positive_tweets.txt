C: (0.528%) T: @BarbaraBoxer Ohio shooter confirmed as a leftist socialist and Elizabeth Warren supporter üòÆ one of yours!
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Despite the fact that one of them is a leftist democrat that supports antifa and endorsed Elizabeth Warren. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
C: (0.985%) T: HOW THE LATEST EPISODE OF #ACS IS BAD FOR ELIZABETH WARREN!!!! - Probably the NYT next year
C: (1.000%) T: I've heard one of the shooters was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.... are they trying to knock her out of the candidacy? Or make her more popular cause she has a radical with a gun.....
C: (1.000%) T: @brianstelter Have we heard anything from Elizabeth warren or Bernie Sanders?
C: (1.000%) T: And the Dayton Ohio shooter supported democrats especially Elizabeth Warren. What‚Äôs your point? https://t.co/esq6OEpsWv
C: (0.994%) T: @iamcardib So white supremacists are DemocRats, Socialists, Satanic @ewarren supporters? ü§î  https://t.co/Kr7iWIUubA
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Yes Elizabeth Warren you are right.i hope and pray that you or a democratic candidate wins the presidency in2020.peace and best of luck to you in your campaign.
C: (1.000%) T: I hope Elizabeth Warren chooses Demi as her running mate #bachelorinparadise
C: (1.000%) T: Described ‚Äúleftie‚Äù &amp; Elizabeth Warren supporter who said ‚Äúhe wants socialism now‚Äù, all Politicians need to have a look at themselves and think before they speak because it‚Äôs dangerous out here now
C: (1.000%) T: @DevinNunes @Globird3 You should read the El Paso shooter‚Äôs manifesto. It reads like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, &amp; AOC could have written it! No wait ... not AOC it is too well written!
C: (1.000%) T: @missoulian Really. The Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders supporter who rode with them and they did no notice he had an assault rifle, full body gear etc. While I feel deeply for anyone killed by one of the sick pieces of crap how did they not see all the gear?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: ‚ÄúSeveral former students who are now (and were then) Republicans declined to talk to me on the record precisely because they liked her so much and did not want to contribute to furthering her political prospects by speaking warmly of her‚Äù https://t.co/nUQWmgeaSA
C: (0.997%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Really ASSHOLE? The shooter in Ohio was a Liberal and a Elizabeth Warren supporter. The shooter in Texas hated President Trump in his  manifesto. But just keep being a good little bitch and hide from the truth
C: (0.844%) T: Had Elizabeth Warren ran in 2016 instead of HRC, the forty-fifth president of the United States would be a woman right now &amp; we'd be enjoying Medicare Expansion instead of arguing over if immigration is really a crisis &amp; if Trump is really a racist. https://t.co/3zF25oVnwj
C: (0.983%) T: @juanmolinapena @jfl500 @dbongino @Castro4Congress I don‚Äôt really have a problem if someone posts my political donantions. If you do, don‚Äôt donate.   I‚Äôve donated to Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Mayor Pete, Amy McGrath and others. Why should I be afraid of that fact?
C: (1.000%) T: @_Yayger @maggieNYT @DavidMDrucker You should go explain this to the Trumpers losing their minds in Castro‚Äôs thread. They are apoplectic - it just shows how full of Fox disinfo they all are - they think Elizabeth Warren is the leader of antifa.
C: (1.000%) T: @burgh_deb @JoyAnnReid @SenToomey Funny. GOP sponsored terror? The Dayton shooter, who apparently used one of these, was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. So Republicans are sponsoring their political enemies?ü§î
C: (1.000%) T: @ictussunshine @Krislee47 @Castro4Congress @NYT @dcexaminer "The account retweeted messages supporting Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as posts against ICE agents, including one that said, "these people are monsters," and multiple posts condemning police, and supporting Antifa protesters, who often use violent tactics."
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib What are you going to do to control some of your RACIST SUPPORTERS? Or even yourself? P.S. I heard that the Dayton shooter was a big fan of Dem. Pres. Cand. Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: What happened in Ohio then can clearly be laid at the Democrat Party's feet. They encouraged people with their hate rhetoric. They created the climate &amp; fanned the flames. Conner Betts was a leftist, a supporter of Elizabeth Warren &amp; a registered Dem who wrote I want socialism! https://t.co/cSQEav4tiC
C: (1.000%) T: Squad Leader Ocasio-Cortez Trump is ‚ÄúDirectly Responsible‚Äù for Mass Shooting in El Paso  Dayton shooter was staunch Democrat Socialist who supported Antifa &amp; Elizabeth Warren  @AOC failed to mention this  She doesn't want Truth, just a FALSE Narrative  https://t.co/dNfgOkV1Aq
C: (0.985%) T: @nypost Also an Elizabeth warren supporter
C: (1.000%) T: Point me to ONE thing Elizabeth Warren has said that has encouraged violence.  If this guy did support Warren, the fact is irrelevant unless she dog-whistled him into doing a shooting.  Trump, by contrast, IS responsible for his supporters because he DOES encourage violence. https://t.co/nqHLnJFZvL
C: (1.000%) T: @squirrel_brian @shannonrwatts Elizabeth Warren is not masogynist psychopath that talks to herself and doesn't sleep at night. Bernie Sanders is a human rights proponent. Why would I blame Obama? Trump has used racist rehtoric and propaganda to defame and defile Central/South Americans, just like Crusius.
