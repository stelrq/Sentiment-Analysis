C: (1.000%) T: @LibertyHussein @ewarren Thanks!!! CAN do the JOb. Elizabeth Warren CAN and WILL do the job. No question.   #TrumpsBodyCount
C: (1.000%) T: This is the most intelligent and sensible thing about gun policies I have seen proposed in years. It is fact-based, doable, self-financing, and it fosters wellbeing. Elizabeth Warren, actually knows how to think in a fact-based way, and in my opinion, and make an excellent POTUS.
C: (1.000%) T: while bts takes a break this will become a political account rn i double bias elizabeth warren and pete buttigieg
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/fuMhOMz4DO Elizabeth &amp; I overlapped for a few semesters at UHLC, my first law teaching job, &amp; I am sure I remember her better than she recalls me. She won teaching awards, &amp; was very generous, letting me sit in her courses to learn. I did learn from her, and still do
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren - The Two Income Trap And The Collapse of Middle Class ... https://t.co/4z4FKemNWW via @YouTube - I think looking back to see what a candidate stood for, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, is a really good metric.....
C: (1.000%) T: @kdellenback The medua doesn't want to even talk about this shooter anymore because he doesn't meet their narratives or agenda. He supported Elizabeth Warren, if he had been a Trump supporter he'd still be relevant.
C: (1.000%) T: It is about how seeing and hearing the candidate makes you feel. And most get a good read from Warren, I think she wins.   https://t.co/M6pBYDn1r8
C: (1.000%) T: You will have no rights under this woman! Total government controlled lives  Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%. https://t.co/98SAMbn5tT   # via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: Thank you, @ewarren for knowing that rural Nevada deserves better! Elizabeth Warren is fighting for big structural change for the entire Silver State -- and the entire country! #NVertheless   https://t.co/kmHSbDIzwr
C: (0.697%) T: Elizabeth Warren, met with the largest Soapbox crowd so far, touts her 2-cent ultra-millionaires tax https://t.co/zjuk8Gkarl
C: (1.000%) T: @RealTimers @JoeBiden @billmaher @HBO Look Iâ€™m going to vote for whoever gets the nomination, but here we go again doing what is safe. If we can be real and really connect with the people whoever we nominate will win. My choice is Elizabeth Warren! I love Joe Biden, but itâ€™s time we move forward and not settle!
C: (1.000%) T: @battletested5 Big time Elizabeth Warren supporter and democrat, but that doesnâ€™t matter, just like the jack wagon that murdered the people in El Paso! They both had some serious mental issues and should have been prevented from owning a gun. Take your Political BS and go elsewhere
C: (1.000%) T: Sleepy Joe Biden wake up. I guess Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Dayton shooting since the shooter was her fan. Democrats are the biggest hypocrites on Earth. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden #FakeNews @ewarren
C: (1.000%) T: @JenandZen Especially since she has to share name recognition with Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @SlowLaneLodge @ABC Elizabeth Warren doesnâ€™t encourage hate at all like Trump does. There are other factors in this. He was a satanist for starters.
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps I told my MIL that Elizabeth Warren reminds me of her in some ways. I meant it as the nicest compliment Iâ€™ve ever paid the woman and she was sort of offended.
C: (1.000%) T: @dbongino The real question- why is he allowed to run as a democrat. He can form a new communist party with Elizabeth warren and the squad.
C: (1.000%) T: Today I need to stop tweeting so much.  I must admit I have my heart set on a woman as president. A womanâ€™s brain works differently than a manâ€™s brain. I like Elizabeth Warren. The only ones I donâ€™t like Tulsi Gabbard. Kirsten Gillibrand no -low numbers. Just me here.
C: (0.989%) T: @SharylAttkisson There is a reason Elizabeth Warren is known as #Liawatha, and its not just the false indian claim.
C: (1.000%) T: @jkempcpa You speak much of Trump's character, but it worse than Warren's?  No way.  She is the absolute worst in a crowded pack.  Excellent article by a never-Trump ethics attorney I know regarding her most recent tweets: https://t.co/SbgufxyarA
C: (1.000%) T: @BetteMidler Since you haven't heard the Dayton shooter was an Antifa &amp; an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  BTW, don't know who you are trying to fool with your profile picture, but it's been years since you looked that good.
C: (0.994%) T: @BFriedmanDC @jwleardi Why is nobody blaming Elizabeth Warren for the Ohio shooter who was a huge supporter and antifa lover.oh I know because Trump is racist..
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/l7ckKCYMEq
C: (1.000%) T: @DeadpoolResists An Elizabeth Warren /Tommy Lee ticket ðŸ—³  Can you imagine? https://t.co/1b1NRV9pth
C: (1.000%) T: Joe Biden thinks it's the 20th century, I'm sorry but I can't survive 4 more years of Trump. I am voting for Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris in the primary. https://t.co/PJHhk22R8T
