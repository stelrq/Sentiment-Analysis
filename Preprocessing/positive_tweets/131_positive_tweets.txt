C: (1.000%) T: @NialElkim I thought this was the beginning of a joke:  the DNC, a pile of money and Elizabeth Warren walk into a bar....
C: (1.000%) T: @dagreatscienski @heavenlyblue67 @RNtalks92 @strazzy_ @BernieSanders He’s actually your buddy. He’s a socialist and Elizabeth Warren fan
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren proposes 'public option for broadband' https://t.co/J7ik9SNkMU
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren you are the reason the Dayton shooter shot everybody isn't that right just like Trump is a reason everybody got shot in El Paso since we're playing the blame game since you people can't seem to blame the people who pulled the trigger it's ridiculous
C: (0.988%) T: @FranciscoHinoPe @BillyCorben @jsaladino24 @MattyInfante Yawn. Straight from an Elizabeth Warren speech.
C: (0.984%) T: @gseagle08 @Ganndalfr You don't have to make up my position.  Elizabeth Warren is advocating government oversight and control. No amount of lying on my position will change that.
C: (1.000%) T: Only Buttigieg is willing to cock slap Trump to win the election in 2020.   Okay, maybe Elizabeth Warren... but, she'll have to borrow one  from Biden.
C: (1.000%) T: Forever the billionaires’ and business allies friend, capitalist Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax the super-rich is not structural change—It was tried and failed before. Liz does not tell us “tax people’s wealth and they will manage to reduce it or hide it” https://t.co/X4b4gPazBj https://t.co/llHPHlnPGG
C: (1.000%) T: @__WeStandUnited I will never forgive Elizabeth warren for this!   And the fact that she said this should tell everyone that she was full of shit when she said she would have been Hillary’s running mate!

C: (1.000%) T: @UnfilteredSE @secupp Go join Elizabeth Warren's campaign! People HATE when the feel you are taking from them.  How to think law abiding Americans are going to feel when you try to TAKE THEIR GOD GIVEN RIGHTS?  You haven't even seen America dip their toes in hate yet!
C: (1.000%) T: @Bekl09 Elizabeth Warren should do the same for her supporters who have attacked me, then  - mainly basic well-off white women with privilege. Hmmmm.
C: (1.000%) T: @yesnicksearcy @TheRISEofROD @UnfilteredSE And the Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  They always seem to leave that one out?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren’s salary to teach one class explains why these colleges cost $80k+ per year and why fewer people can afford to go to these “elite” schools. She takes the money while pushing the middle class down, making college tuition that much more difficult to pay. https://t.co/EKI6T3L6cG
C: (1.000%) T: Why don’t you just go have coffee with Elizabeth Warren there’s nobody in their right mind wants to be with either one of you. https://t.co/u1NNyJ64Lg
C: (0.984%) T: Michael Bloomberg sasses Elizabeth Warren for digs on the 1 percent https://t.co/FxlJqfcDDo via @nypost
C: (1.000%) T: @ScottCDunn @Bekl09 @SenSanders @ewarren @TulsiGabbard @AndrewYang Please do not include Elizabeth Warren in any kind of progressive universe. She is a grandstanding Hillary Ho.

C: (1.000%) T: @UnfilteredSE @secupp The alt left pro antifa Elizabeth Warren supporter. Did your bidding. CNN loves Antifa. Ask, Don &amp; Chris. &amp; Jakes new friend. KKK member Richard Spencer. Bye bia'cth
C: (1.000%) T: Someone told me Elizabeth Warren is a ballbuster! I said good! A ballbusting girl as president will bring good change to this country!

C: (0.968%) T: @kstronach24 @kristinbwell @mrshobbs58 @GerardoHGarcia @SharylAttkisson @ewarren Actually this whole thread started with Senator Elizabeth Warren reaching back in the memory hole and accusing an innocent cop of murder.    And a real journalist like Sharyl Atkinson calling her on it.   When your opponents traffic in blood libel what can decent people do Ken?
C: (1.000%) T: @Arriadna @ari2020 @ProudResister @PaulLeeTicks @greenbling333 @EmmaKinery @Scairp114 Elizabeth Warren so far. But I’ll vote for whoever becomes the nominee.
C: (1.000%) T: @StefanMolyneux His hero is Elizabeth Warren? He's balls couldn't have been installed correctly.
