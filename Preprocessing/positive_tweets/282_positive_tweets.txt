C: (1.000%) T: @james_mathurin_ @TakedownMRAs @fightinandwords @BoopitySnoot I mean it is, each of those shooters, with the recent Ohio shooting, have all supported ANTIFA and were Democrats, the Ohio shooter being a big fan of Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @maggieNYT @TimOBrien You know, that would be some pretty interesting reporting! Do you know any reporters?   I mean, if it's super interesting to talk about Elizabeth Warren's speaker fees, maybe it would be super interesting to report on Trump's finances!
C: (1.000%) T: **I guess Elizabeth Warren doesn't think having CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, and NY Times as the Democrat PR arm and their Crisis Management team isn''t enough. Full on Propaganda . .  **Once again . . @ewarren  why do you want me required to pay for others internet service?ü§î https://t.co/DgsQrAB3BO

C: (1.000%) T: Let me know when white supremacists are inspired by the Elizabeth Warren campaign to carry out violence against poc then we can talk.
C: (1.000%) T: @guypbenson Silly Elizabeth Warren, if you want to win Iowans over, you say Pork, Pork is my favorite word. üêñ Her campaign speech writer failed her...
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren supporters: a border wall is evil and only for racists.  *Elizabeth Warren votes yes for a 700 mike border wall in 2013*  Elizabeth Warren supporters: well if she says it's a good thing then it must be.
C: (1.000%) T: @SenWarren Please address that the killers were huge Elizabeth Warren fans. Huge fans of socialism!!!

C: (1.000%) T: My burning question: what was her advice on motion sickness! Signed, a professional who travels a lot and is prone to motion sickness (and has major anxiety surrounding it). https://t.co/jFxiaxn6wB
C: (1.000%) T: @BreitbartNews @ChatByCC I‚Äôm not running for president so I can say this is nothing more than pandering for votes. The only people that should be considered for reparations are the Native Americans   (Excluding Elizabeth Warren). We should look at the broken treaties we made.
C: (1.000%) T: @Rob_the_H @emrazz @TomiLahren Isn‚Äôt that the same as all politicians? Do you actually trust that Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, or Ted Cruz are sincerely looking out for your best interest?

C: (1.000%) T: @GmanFan45 @Jali_Cat @TheDemocrats @PoppyHarlowCNN @niaCNN @SenWarren Wtf are you talking about @GmanFan45?  Who cares whether it‚Äôs a false flag, most don‚Äôt even understand them.I think the point of the tweet was to prove if the new standard is the politician is to blame for the crazy behind the gun then Elizabeth Warren is the blame for this one.
C: (1.000%) T: @BreitbartNews How many want to bet...Elizabeth Warren will say she's part black üòÇ
C: (0.997%) T: Absolutely no one: we need to fix internet problem in this country. THATS the issue I‚Äôm worried about at this time!  Elizabeth Warren: https://t.co/9MET58ci7c
C: (1.000%) T: @kanga5328 @ProudResister They wouldn't support her, no matter what. That's just a convenient excuse. If she modulated her tone, they would say she lacks energy &amp; passion. It's all bullshit. Let Elizabeth Warren be Elizabeth Warren, and inspire our daughters to be passionate &amp; fight.

C: (0.812%) T: @ewarren They've already tried that Elizabeth Warren. Maybe we should tax very bad politicians who lie about their Heritage and then try to be president. Maybe we should tax them so much that they finally give up their stupid ridiculous bid for presidency
C: (0.994%) T: @g8orshan @RobertMaguire_ @WendySiegelman You might note I am advocating for a Democrat: Elizabeth Warren. You may have heard of her. She has a plan.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren understand the issues, understands the laws, understands how government works, and has a will to serve ALL--this makes her the best candidate for 2020. We need a daily report: Lead Ahead with Elizabeth Warren because good Americans near to hear her good words daily.
C: (1.000%) T: Woo Chile...I caught the tea though... ‚ÄúAbrams‚Äôs plain talk shows up in the stump speeches of many of the Dem presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, &amp; Beto O‚ÄôRourke...&amp; Alyssa Milano trying to cause job losses in the ATL https://t.co/Gqtpz3X9yB
