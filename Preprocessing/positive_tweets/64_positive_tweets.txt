C: (1.000%) T: @freedom4all117 @MschRn @LittleAprilQ1 @EganLA @TuckerCarlson @ShepNewsTeam @FoxNewsSunday These democrats I tell ya. They believe everything that the fake news media tell them. They can‚Äôt help it. Both shooters from Saturday registered Democrats. Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren Socialist antifa lover and El Paso guy was a racist anti immigrant climate nut!! https://t.co/wQBwiHUt5k
C: (0.994%) T: @cpicciolini If tables were turned, youd be saying Elizabeth Warren and revolutionary communist groups are all one group and treat them all the same. That's how ignorant you are
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC He wrote on Twitter that he would happily vote for Democrat Elizabeth Warren, praised Satan, was upset about the 2016 presidential election results, and added,‚ÄúI want socialism, and i‚Äôll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding.‚Äù I think YOU AOC caused this
C: (1.000%) T: @jess_mc I like Joe but I‚Äôm nervous! I think he was trying to say that poor children are just as bright as wealthy children.  He is my first choice but I‚Äôm really starting to look at Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @Wally389 @MrTommyLand No the Dayton shooter doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative as he was a leftist Elizabeth warren and supporter of Antifa
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson @DrJasonJohnson Do you think Elizabeth Warren has the best shot at beating Biden? And is the black vote off the table for her? ( winning a majority)
C: (1.000%) T: @tweettruth2me Loopholes in the ACA gives PBMs, pharmacy benefits managers, the ability to get records thru pharmacies.  BTW, former head of CMS, Andy Slavitt and Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs daughter formed a company that gathered information. Then they made bank selling the company..and your info.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren‚Äù was a lying, conniving, bitter old hag who appropriated a race and culture to which she didn‚Äôt belong for her own profit. I said ‚Äúwho‚Äôs Elizabeth warren?‚Äù

C: (0.989%) T: @JohnL4 @Delafina777 Elizabeth Warren is not a racist. Donald Trump is. I, for one, would love to see the hood removed on the supporters of his racism.
C: (1.000%) T: Good article and radio interview with Elizabeth Warren on her approach to teaching, using the Socratic method https://t.co/uO1DCzN5Jq

C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren This what you said, Elizabeth Warren just called President Trump a white supremacist, again....She said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs done everything he can to stir up racial conflict &amp; hatred in this country. LOOK IN THE MIRROR WARREN &amp; SEE THE HEARTLESS. HATEFUL EVIL THAT WILL BE DEFEAT YOU

C: (0.993%) T: MEANWHILE.... In March it was revealed US immigration officials had compiled a secret database containing information on dozens of reporters, attorneys, activists. Thx to Sens Joe Udall, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Richard Blumenthal for investigating https://t.co/0pCVDFLgGS
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist - CNNPolitics https://t.co/9bTQu4hSzb she is a  very good bullshiter
C: (0.987%) T: @_waleedshahid Hopefully, Elizabeth Warren over his shoulder.
C: (0.960%) T: @CNN Elizabeth Warren are you so dumb with this white supremacist rant that you don't think some one is going to ask you HOW
C: (1.000%) T: @aLilNightMusing So many things come to me by wordless comprehension. For instance that Elizabeth Warren would have sought to destroy department stores, for the same reasons she seeks to destroy Amazon and such. :)
C: (1.000%) T: @ZTimewaster @BernieSanders No I'm with ya, it's not a purity test I love Burnie and Elizabeth Warren is my fav pick for the nomination but I'm saying as part of that structural change that we need our leaders who are leading the fight for climate change need to set an example to get that structural change
C: (1.000%) T: Together, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren represent the spirit of the Status of Liberty.
C: (1.000%) T: @DanielTurnerPTF @hwholcomb Just like Obama wanted to change the laws of physics, because they had control of the House and the Senate. Elizabeth Warren think she can control mother nature.
