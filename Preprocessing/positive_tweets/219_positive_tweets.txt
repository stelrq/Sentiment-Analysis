C: (1.000%) T: @IngrahamAngle Investigation Needed? Did AOC ask Elizabeth Warren? "When you were an Indian, did you kill Buffaloes for their little wings?" What was her answer?
C: (1.000%) T: @TeaPainUSA Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren loving, Antifa, Satanist mofo, STFU Tea Balls.   You‚Äôre the party of Identity Politics. Which looks at color, ethnicity, sex and stereotypes everyone, instead of looking at the individual based on their character and how they treat others. #uRRacist
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren doesn't know how to be relevant without attacking people who are better, smarter and more honest than her. Warren is a disgusting, smelly, individual. https://t.co/8AbsM0bo9R
C: (1.000%) T: @BreitbartNews Well. You can change that. After all, Bruce Jenner changed his gender, Elizabeth Warren decided to be a Native American.  I dont see why you can‚Äôt just identify as a purple dinosaur and give all your ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù to the homeless. And shut up.

C: (1.000%) T: @RantsByDesign Oh god it‚Äôs gonna be 2016 all over again.  While I like Elizabeth Warren better than most of the other people running and think she‚Äôs got better proposals than them‚ÄîBernie has the proposals and the support that will win.  No more wonk bullshit! Eliminating THAT is feminist.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren today in Iowa: "Porch is my favorite word. I love porches."  Sounds like to me she is ready to end her campaign and go back home.   Thoughts?
C: (1.000%) T: @JackPosobiec I know, what are the odds? She's covering Elizabeth Warren and happens to run in to Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: Tired of ‚Äúelectability‚Äù arguments? Me too! Paraphrasing ‚Å¶@SenWarren‚Å©, I won‚Äôt choose a candidate I don‚Äôt believe in precisely because I‚Äôm too scared to do anything else. I won‚Äôt abdicate my precious vote to pollsters and electability wonks. https://t.co/XS7GH6Rf3A

C: (1.000%) T: @GlobalViewII1 @karen3678 @twhlvrldy @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm afraid you need to do your research. The Dayton shooter was an avid Elizabeth Warren follower. Go ahead and check out the other two. You will find the same. As for not knowing the world, I have been to 36 countries and all 50 states. I know how the world works.
C: (0.992%) T: @USC017 @ewarren ... I guess you realized I was right and you're not going to lie about Elizabeth Warren on the internet anymore.

C: (1.000%) T: @larryelder Need to Know. Did AOC ask Elizabeth Warren? "When you were an Indian, did you kill Buffaloes for their little wings?" What was her answer?
C: (1.000%) T: @FrankConniff You don't think Elizabeth Warren calling herself a capitalist has anything to do with a *socialist* organization refusing to endorse her?
C: (0.986%) T: @CarlBeijer Elizabeth Warren has sucked up all his momentum. üòü
C: (0.921%) T: @JenniWrenB @P1B_WMichigan @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Common this is Elizabeth Warren we‚Äôre talking about. Nothing is left 2 chance.I‚Äôm still surprised she‚Äôs around after her race fraud. Now why is she (a multimillionaire) being so cheap with the girl? Probably because it was a girl‚Äôs stand,had it been a boy‚Äôs it would have been $20
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol No, rephrase that. The nation deserves Elizabeth Warren. They deserve paying their fair share of the tax burden plus a cold splash of reality.
C: (1.000%) T: @redsteeze ‚ÄúHow the farmer Elizabeth warren Met is the real reason our oceans are rising and that there is white supremacy today‚Äù
C: (0.538%) T: @GeorgeTakei Yet you were silent when Hussein Obama called for the murdering of law enforcement, Bernie Sanders when he ordered the shooting of Republican congressional members and Elizabeth Warren for her shooter who did her bidding in Ohio. The hypocrisy is just too much
C: (1.000%) T: ‚Å¶@HuffPost‚Å© @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats  America in need of plain speak Warren and O‚ÄôRourke offer. Donald in Denial may want us to excuse his forked tongue; in the name of his victims, we are here to hold Trump accountable. https://t.co/ojzgIQU308
