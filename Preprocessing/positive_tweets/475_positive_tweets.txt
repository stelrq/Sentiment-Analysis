C: (0.972%) T: @Alfred_2009 @CNNPolitics Elizabeth Warren doesn’t spout hate rhetoric. Trump on the other hand, does. It’s why his base loves him. They love that he wants to hurt people.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren like many more of the False Idols of today spew their hatred of America and it's "values".  Here are the only titles you hold, liar - false prophet - desperate - so walk on Ms. Warren, we see you. https://t.co/ADApOtyg63
C: (1.000%) T: @Caitlinh24 @bristoltrucker @Talkmaster @amnestyusa I’m sure you know this and are just regurgitating false information, but the Dayton shooter was not a white nationalist. He was a socialist Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: “The secret to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's success — so far — has been talking to voters about the issues that motivate them, and the ones that motivate her.”   Welp. Cats outta the bag now.   https://t.co/VxOX8o3SNb

C: (1.000%) T: El Paso shooter manifesto says ideas about Mexicans pre-date trump. Dayton shooter was socialist, for Elizabeth Warren and Berny Sanders. If you want to draw a parallel,  then all are responsible for murders...absurd
C: (1.000%) T: @DonnaLynnNH Elizabeth Warren is the product of privilege and is not qualified to represent the common people.  We are the 40%   #harvardLaw #warren2020 #imwithHer #anybluewilldo #m4a #demdebate #occupy #buildthewall
C: (1.000%) T: @sara4SF @Mel_Ankoly @DrJasonJohnson Question, are our only options to enact what Elizabeth Warren has suggested or go with the status quo, with no other options available?
C: (0.709%) T: Elizabeth Warren would never dream of genie
C: (1.000%) T: Biden takes Hell for a gaffe where he used the wrong word.  And everybody says Elizabeth Warren doesn’t make mistakes like that.  Can you explain to me why she uses the word “murder” here? And why is this not just as bad as Biden’s gaffe? https://t.co/xFVgIqoC5E
C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 I cant seem to find your tweet blaming Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shootings.  Can you help me find it?
