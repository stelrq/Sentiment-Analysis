C: (0.980%) T: @biggazza77 @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Gaza, So does Bernie have blood on his hands? The Rep House shooter loved him. Or does Elizabeth Warren have blood on her hands because the Dayton Ohio shooter loved her. I could go on. It must be hard to be you with all that hate in you and no logic.
C: (0.995%) T: @RyanLosAngeles @LorenThowe @brookefoxnews @MattWolking @Castro4Congress Pocahontas? Only a Satanist Mass shooter would vote for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.999%) T: And you are a pathological liar just like your buddy Bernie Sanders and your little friend Elizabeth Warren oh and don't forget Kamala Harris https://t.co/fALOlHgj2p
C: (0.987%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You stupid fuck, the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan.
C: (0.987%) T: @CNN @bmarsalis He should have pointed out Elizabeth Warren and Satan's roles: https://t.co/8UzlTDWcT2
C: (0.999%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump That angry Elizabeth Warren person. She better cool it. https://t.co/JVyfD6Ehmb
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The Dayton shooter said he was voting for Elizabeth Warren. Democrats are debating whatever hysterical conspiracy theory that you enjoy- @ewarren
C: (0.984%) T: @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump The Dayton mass shooter sighted Elizabeth Warren why aren’t you blaming her
C: (0.981%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl So you are hoping the elizabeth warren democrat who just committed mass murder in ohio will take up your call.  Fascist
C: (0.985%) T: Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the shooting in Texas because the man that shot those people is a socialist!
C: (1.000%) T: @Kimbraov1 @WatchnDaWorld And he was an Elizabeth Warren fan boy.
C: (0.526%) T: @JoeBiden Poor Joe!!  He doesn't know that the DAYTON SHOOTER IS AN ELIZABETH WARREN SUPPORTER!  Joe!! Does that mean we should HOLD ELIZ WARREN RESPONSIBLE for the Dayton murders???
C: (1.000%) T: Good profile of Elizabeth Warren as educator: “Come on, get better at what you’ve got and widen it out, because the only mistake you can make is not to get out there and do something with passion”  Elizabeth Warren Is the Most Professorial Candidate Ever https://t.co/VuGOpX0YLP
C: (1.000%) T: Joe Biden keeps his lead over Bernie Sanders in Democratic 2020 race after second debates - with Elizabeth Warren taking third place from Kamala Harris https://t.co/kaiSWPqr6J
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren lied about her true heritage. I said yes and lied about so much more.
C: (0.999%) T: Et tu @NicolleDWallace ? Apparently every single moderator on @MSNBC is incapable of speaking Bernie Sanders name? Even though he is in the running with Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke,  you ignore him as if he was the Invisible Man  I will never forgive you for your failure
C: (0.995%) T: @daveweigel Yikes its almost like she’s not committed to medicare for all and already put out her own trash ACA 2.0 plan or something lol https://t.co/RQKePWd6Y3
C: (1.000%) T: A new Department of Internet Access to provide  DMV-Like service  Elizabeth Warren says screw your ISP. Let’s make the internet a public utility https://t.co/onx3YtcnTK https://t.co/N9LFynFFp9
C: (0.536%) T: @GlendalePatriot @ewarren That, and Elizabeth Warren and the Dem Candidates have nothing else to run on.  Just that, and higher taxes, more regulations, scree the economy with all their freebies, etc.
C: (1.000%) T: @EvanAKilgore The candidate I like the least is Elizabeth Warren. I live in Massachusetts and she has done nothing for me and I really don’t want the US to become a socialist nation. Bernie Sanders is my 2nd least favorite. Too close to home.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was really Indian? I said fuck no.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Funny how Warren had to be "asked" before she offered this opinion! By the way, Trump was a white supremacist when Warren let Hillary rig Bernie Sanders in 2016. No one will ever accuse Elizabeth Warren of LEADERSHIP. https://t.co/VEUJmcqsfU
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether the president is a white supremacist. I said yes. Who am I? A liberal pushing for power and money named Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was of Native American descent and a serious contender for the presidency. I laughed out loud.
C: (1.000%) T: @sairasameerarao @ConorMichael28 Ask Elizabeth Warren. She used the shooting to get donations.
