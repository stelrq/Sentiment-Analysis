C: (1.000%) T: @JoyceWhiteVance Um, the Dayton  shooter was a committed socialist, and fan of Elizabeth Warren....so.....

C: (0.988%) T: This fab article about Elizabeth Warren by @rtraister deserves your attention #amreading https://t.co/hYnLr4POBq
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Only difference Charlie is Elizabeth Warren didn't call any one "rapists", "criminals", "murderers" and didn't smirk &amp; joke when a supporter shouted "shoot them" when asked what to do about an 'invasion' of illegal immigrants or anyone else. Trump did.
C: (0.999%) T: @rezaaslan Don't forget the Dayton shooter was a left wing loon and socialist, as well as an Elizabeth Warren fan. Did Trump inspire his white nationalist terrorism?
C: (1.000%) T: @shortalbino OMG! I see the  Yang gang pounced! Elizabeth Warren has some great policies and is a fighter..Kamala Harris is high on my list as well. While I love the message Julian Castro has, I dont think he will poll high enough to stay in the race. It comes down to anyone but Trump!
C: (0.724%) T: @ProudResister   You went through your whole podcast and never mentioned the Dayton shooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis Apparently you all read from the same page. Was it the one that supported Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or AOC?
C: (1.000%) T: @MadRiverCPA @markknoller So I guess Bernie inspired the shooter at the congressional baseball practice?  Or did Elizabeth Warren inspire the killer in Dayton?
C: (0.998%) T: @TimRunsHisMouth Maybe he was even related to Elizabeth Warren.  You never know these days!
C: (0.974%) T: @SenMcCollister RINO ASSHOLE, one of the shooters was a Elizabeth Warren supporter as you should be! Change your affiliation to Democrat,so you don’t fool uninformed people.
C: (0.970%) T: @el_gillysal @AOC @senatemajldr No because in no way did Elizabeth Warren encourage him to shoot another human being whereas #TrumpIsAWhiteNationalist has actually encouraged it.  See the difference.
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Is AOC responsible for antifa violence against ICE? Is Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Dayton shooter? Is Bernie Sanders responsible for the shooting of Steve Scalise?  Why don’t you try holding the actual shooter responsible, you pandering, opportunistic, commie.
C: (0.999%) T: Exciting time to be a socialist: We just had an amazing @DemSocialists convention, and now Bernie is only four points behind Biden in the polls.  Joe Biden 22% Bernie Sanders 18% Elizabeth Warren 9% Harris 6% Buttigieg 4%  https://t.co/17p768VPKC

C: (1.000%) T: I haven’t decided on a candidate yet for the Dem primary, though I am leaning heavily towards Elizabeth Warren. Many have spoken on this issue, &amp; I share this because I saw it shortly after seeing the previous tweet. We need to do better. https://t.co/aaSmMiemjB
C: (1.000%) T: Poll: Dems say Warren reigned in second primary debates https://t.co/Q9dXgsLBPE via @politico
C: (0.987%) T: @KamalaHarris Start with outlawing Antifa who the shooter adored, along with Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: We (my wife &amp; I) would LOVE 2 have coffee with Elizabeth Warren! We've been involved in the promotion of her work since 2009.
C: (1.000%) T: @AGB88888 @abcnews Alex, valid point though you are talking bout USA here.  We have similar issue re those CLAIMING to be supporting The Left here in Oz, but more extreme there.   Elizabeth Warren has sone concerning views.  We need only look at the corruption and lies from the DNC to understand
C: (0.997%) T: @davidsirota Great. Also: please never prop up Elizabeth Warren again. Ever. You work ONLY for Bernie.
C: (1.000%) T: @EASTBAYDFRESH @MixsterM A self described "leftist" who supported Elizabeth Warren, hated Trump, and promoted freeing all immigrants being held in ICE camps....Ya, sure sounds like a White Supremacist to me....The fact that you jumped to conclusions based on his race shows who the real racist is.....YOU!
C: (1.000%) T: @atrupar @ShirleyDebalsi How does that matter?  Will it bring those people back?  Did the shooter leave a manifesto behind claiming Elizabeth Warren had a plan 4 that &amp; it's the reason he slaughtered those people.  Please remove your head from your ass.
C: (0.783%) T: CNN: Reported Ohio shooter was obsession with violence, supported Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren. Was against ICE &amp; called them monsters. Posted condemning police and supporting Antifa protesters, who often use violent tactics. https://t.co/Z4E3S0Ckbm
C: (0.518%) T: @kyleco @RealCandaceO @AOC @BetoORourke So if you are being fair do you think that Elizabeth Warren’s rhetoric was to blame for the Dayton shooter?
