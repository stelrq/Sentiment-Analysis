C: (0.985%) T: @XplodeAthletics @SalgadoPhoto_ Just curious, do you saw the ‚Äúmanifesto‚Äù or someone told you about the manifesto. And what about the Ohio shooter Elizabeth Warren follower that he also has a manifesto?

C: (1.000%) T: If Elizabeth Warren is your first pick for president, I have to assume you don‚Äôt care about foreign policy/US imperialism.
C: (0.995%) T: @robreiner Seems to me your are the one who is racist. You don‚Äôt use facts. This is a sign of weakness. The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren shooter. Is she a White supremacist too? https://t.co/2wqdLEiOHf

C: (1.000%) T: @c_angelc419 @Axeman4guitars @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson That's also why the shooter in Ohio was a leftist liberal who supported Elizabeth Warren but they don't want to talk about that. Doesn't fit the narrative!

C: (1.000%) T: @Tru_Blu_Patriot @hulibow @tera_emter @JoaquinCastrotx So Dayton‚Äôs on AOC and socialist and The ICE bomber is in Elizabeth Warren and all the rest of the Dems. That‚Äôs two for you. Not sure you want to play this game - the numbers don‚Äôt bode well for libs. That‚Äôs the truth even if CNN won‚Äôt tell you that.

C: (0.662%) T: @RepTimRyan @senatemajldr Go knock on Elizabeth Warren's door since the Dayton killer supported her and was a Satanist.  It was her lying and hateful rhetoric which caused the killings.  See the connection?  Salem Massachusetts, Satanist, Socialist, Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN You need to repeat the news as you see it and not omit"The account retweeted messages supporting Sens.

C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Hey clown, what about Dayton?  Rabid Elizabeth Warren and Antifa supporter shoots up a city but that doesn‚Äôt fit your twisted hateful narrative.
C: (1.000%) T: @adamcbest The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan. The El Paso shooter was also an environmentalist. The ICE facility attacker was an AOC supporter and used her same language in his remarks. Are they all to blame for those incidents and partially to blame for El Paso?
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Let me out myself now. I've donated three times to Elizabeth Warren's campaign. I even bought a t-shirt! I like it it says resist!
