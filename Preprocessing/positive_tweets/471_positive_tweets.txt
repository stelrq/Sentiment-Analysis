C: (0.987%) T: @_CLancellotti @SohrabAhmari Isn't Elizabeth Warren doing the very same thing?
C: (1.000%) T: "Today I was asked whether (Elizabeth Warren) is a white supremacist. I said yes." https://t.co/XrUCPFuj9G

C: (1.000%) T: @marcushjohnson What about Elizabeth Warren, she has spent a lot of time out there already
C: (1.000%) T: WTF? ðŸ˜¡ What kinda BS is THIS? Win a chance to drink a beer with her? Are you kidding me.  SMDH   https://t.co/gyaQ5lTnV9 | Enter to Grab a Drink with Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/po0I4c7kAC
C: (0.984%) T: @barstooltweetss Elizabeth Warren is a douche, I wouldâ€™ve charged her 17 doll hairs.
C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren calls Trump a white supremacist https://t.co/DFyTWV6cwx #FoxNews
C: (0.635%) T: @njcolas i mean yes it'd still cut into their AUM sources, but i don't understand why people assume that elizabeth warren of all people would choose the dumbest imaginable way to implement a tax
C: (0.884%) T: @RedNationRising They donâ€™t mention he called himself a Lefty Socialist, he wants to cut holes in border walls &amp; fences. They certainly donâ€™t mention he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  Why isnâ€™t the media blaming her or the radical left?ðŸ¤”
C: (1.000%) T: @SenMcCollister Now talk about the Antifa-loving leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren and gun control, who shy and killed innocents in Dayton, including his own sister.
C: (1.000%) T: "Elizabeth Warren is saying that we should break up Google...but she's very misguided...it will make it worse, because now all these smaller companies who don't have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation..." https://t.co/KCpFZ7nt1Y
C: (1.000%) T: @davidconner26 @RepEscobar So we should also expect a statement of remorse from Elizabeth Warren, who was supported by the Dayton shooter?
C: (0.985%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr In 2016, a Republicans in the Senate voted unanimously to ban people from buying guns who were on the FBIâ€™s terrorist watch list.  The NRA supported it.Â   *Every Democrat including Elizabeth Warren Voted. Against. It.
C: (1.000%) T: This woman can look at an arena filled with Trump supporters, and see into every one of their hearts and "discern" that they are full of hate. wow, skills.  https://t.co/Yz9BZRHf3b via @BreitbartNews
C: (1.000%) T: But no mention that the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter ... and that Cory is a total #Hypocrite for blaming El Paso on Trump but NOT blaming Dayton on the Fake-Cherokee ...who just like Cory... stokes hate and class and race division ... #nhpolitics https://t.co/NOhCgPo7iJ
C: (1.000%) T: A Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assasinate Republicans playing baseball, a Elizabeth Warren supporter kills 9 in Dayton Ohio, 24 mass shooters during the Obama Administration.
C: (1.000%) T: @Grandma_Shelia @CanResistance He was obviously mentally ill.  It sounds like you are suffering from cognative dissonance.  I know it is hard to reconcile the conflict that he murdered 9 people with the idea that he stated that he favored Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.986%) T: The Dayton shooter was a huge supporter of Elizabeth Warren so it must be her fault that he committed this evil act. It must be something she said. It must be her rhetoric that has caused this division and she should not be welcomed in Dayton. Sound familiar?  #WheresMitch #KAG https://t.co/IuJFs0jPAT
C: (0.722%) T: @BillKristol Geez, I won. Or lost.  I love Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: I'm certainly a piece of work, ain't I...a shameless, small-minded little turd I am. I'll lie, slander &amp; defame anyone that gets in my way People. Who Are Hateful â€˜Celebrateâ€™ President Trump https://t.co/NjNVijoQhl
C: (0.674%) T: Cops' amazing takedown of Dayton killer who called himself a 'leftist,' pro-Satan, socialist Elizabeth Warren fan https://t.co/Jpy6QmhLoC via @BIZPACReview
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren was being more honest when she said she was a Native American. The evidence plainly showed the officer was defending himself and he was even cleared by the Obama Justice Department. https://t.co/GPbOFmFy43
C: (1.000%) T: @rescott534 @PelosiSquadFive @ewarren She was also among the first national politicians to repeatedly say that Black Lives Matter, without tacking on an "all lives matter" https://t.co/4ehhdaLKcw
C: (1.000%) T: @LisaTalmadge @Herb4Warren @HelenBrosnan Really?  I just looked up her record - in 2012 she spoke out against DOMA - there are years of supportive votes - I'm supporting Bernie - but your charge against Warren doesn't appear to be correct. https://t.co/Lzfjza3JcX
C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren Bull Crap to English Translation:  An Elizabeth Warren Administration will continue this War on Cops...She Must NEVER be President...  Trump or Socialism, That is your only Choice For 2020...  Socialism = Misery &amp; Death  You Decide!!!
