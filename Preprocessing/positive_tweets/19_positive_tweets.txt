C: (1.000%) T: @CNN A time for Peace &amp; healing but Escobar &amp; the Deep State media continue to inflame racial divide, as the Socialists &amp; Democrats raise money off these tragedies.  The man who shot the people in Dayton was a strong supporter of Elizabeth Warren.  God Bless Everyone.
C: (0.997%) T: @gtconway3d probably you know this woman...she protect the liar in chief and is also a terrible liar.... I feel sorry for you... https://t.co/WH6VkVOY6h
C: (1.000%) T: How come the media didn‚Äôt blame Elizabeth Warren when the Ohio shooter supported her?  How come the media didn‚Äôt blame AOC, The antifa attacker the ICE facility quoted her words?  STOP BLAMING TRUMP and start blaming the guy who committed this heinous crime.
C: (0.986%) T: Elizabeth Warren didn't encourage him https://t.co/Lx9T5w2ljq
C: (1.000%) T: I love everything @rtraister writes, but this profile on @ewarren  is a particularly wonderful read.  https://t.co/h0EWPbKmaC
C: (1.000%) T: Original headline: Trump urges unity vs racism. / Liberal Mob dictated headline:  Assailing hate but not guns. And the gunmen (in their manifestos) wanted to vote for Elizabeth Warren and get the government to supply free stuff (socialist dreamers).
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Ya, she also supported Elizabeth Warren, and the squad, so by liberal standards, they are responsible for this. @ewarren @realDonaldTrump  @DonaldJTrumpJr @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @SenKamalaHarris @amyklobuchar @AOC @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Going by your standards Beto; The Dayton shooter was a left wing satanist who supported Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and in fact loved a lot of your propaganda too..That‚Äôs YOUR fault!! YOU murdered all those innocent people Beto!! You set the standard you must live by it!‚öîÔ∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
C: (0.996%) T: @NBCNews Which is why the overwhelming majority of the are lefties like the Elizabeth Warren supporter in Dayton https://t.co/o07YFrKUw4
C: (1.000%) T: @rtraister F'n brilliant article. Thank you for the insight.  I don't think many people understand what drives Elizabeth Warren...her story is The American Story.   Even Red Meat Tom Cotton cannot deny her skill...
C: (0.997%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress How about the Dayton shooter that was an Elizabeth Warren fan? Did you forget that? Are you ignoring it for some reason?
C: (0.995%) T: @BuckSexton So now that we know who the biggest Trump donors are, how about posting the names of those donating the largest sums to Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O‚ÄôRourke et cetera?

C: (1.000%) T: @BarackObama Barack,  anyone who lives in reality and who don't fall for this president's con truly appreciates the progress you made being  the president this president's attempt to corrupt our country fails I truly hope your by Joe's side, joe and Elizabeth Warren side when there elected
C: (0.982%) T: @JoeNBC That‚Äôs like saying whoever donates to Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs campaign supports mass shooters since she still hasn‚Äôt condemned her supporter/mass shooter in Dayton
C: (1.000%) T: @660Mary @Lee6CatCrazy @ewarren @senatemajldr I'm glad Elizabeth Warren is advocating for proper voter Id for the 2020 elections to insure it's accuracy and to make sure Russia doesn't sweep in and vote magically as Dems claim.
C: (1.000%) T: @luvmepIs Based on facts, he‚Äôs your president too, since you live in the U.S. Oh, and the Ohio shooter was a big Elizabeth Warren fan, should we blame her? I don‚Äôt like Trump‚Äôs approach or way of speaking sometimes but you as a person have a choice to commit a mass shooting.
C: (1.000%) T: @PeteButtigieg @NRA And the next day a pro antifa follower of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and Trump hater killed nine people in Ohio including his sister. What did she say to set him off ???????
C: (1.000%) T: @HFlandersNP His message is out there.  The more important thing is getting people to support him or Elizabeth Warren over Joe Biden.  If Biden wins the nomination, I feel another 4 years of Trump is inevitable.
C: (0.991%) T: Another Democratic operative put it more bluntly: ‚ÄúWarren has built a monster.‚Äù https://t.co/s5zcRUP8yw
C: (1.000%) T: @PattyMurray @senatemajldr Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed ‚Äúpro-Satan‚Äù views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren.  He was also very pro gun control....so blame warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @mitchellvii Spartacus what's inspiring White Nationalism is Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Also free Healthcare for illegals. Read the Manifesto.
C: (1.000%) T: Everybody needs to stop preening in front of the cameras,‚Äù Conway said. ‚ÄúStop raising money ‚Äî Elizabeth Warren, I‚Äôm talking to you ‚Äî for Senate candidates off of this, and stand up and work with us.‚Äù‚Äî @KellyannePolls üò≠ü§£üòÇ https://t.co/1hrZDtQH8Y
C: (1.000%) T: @tribelaw Ok Larry. Duly noted. One little problem. You haven‚Äôt proven a direct connection between the President and the shooter. By your standard, Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Ohio shooter. She has pre-committed a high crime. Therefore, she is disqualified
C: (1.000%) T: - An Elizabeth Warren/Cory Booker ticket would be great! https://t.co/k5kLt6s3X7
