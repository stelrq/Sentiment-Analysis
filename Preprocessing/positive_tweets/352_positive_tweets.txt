C: (1.000%) T: @CNNPolitics Weird, I don't remember him condemning Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooting, Bernie for the Congressional baseball game shooting, or AOC for the ICE facility attack. Must have missed it, cus I'm sure he doesn't use double standards.
C: (1.000%) T: @AP And some of Elizabeth Warren’s words mirrored language linked to another one of the weekend’s shooters. If you’re looking for who is fanning the flames for such violence you don’t need to look any further than the associated press and anyone else running stories like this
C: (0.984%) T: Dayton shooter was a committed leftist, Democrat, Elizabeth Warren supporter and a Donald Trump hater.  If people had no gun they would use a knife, a rope, poison or bare hands. https://t.co/k6lVJNuKNA
C: (0.635%) T: @verbella1 @thedailybeast @AOC I dont think there's any danger of that, they are not Elizabeth Warren supporters, like the Dayton shooter. They are not AOC fans, as the guy who firebombed ICE was. They are not Bernie Sanders fans, like the guy who tried to murder GOP senators was (and who shot Sen Scalise).
C: (1.000%) T: @nanwhaley Are you insane nanny? You want to encourage more vitriol? How does that help or honor the victims? Protest trump because “he made this bed?” Your shooter was a leftist antifa cross-dressing Satan worshipper who supported Elizabeth warren &amp; Bernie. So are his deeds their fault?
C: (1.000%) T: @SmartAlexJones @NicholsUprising @BetoORourke Check out Beto's positions on his website: https://t.co/ck4XJ7fAjb. He has as many plans as Elizabeth Warren! I particularly like his climate plan. (It was the first, which tells you something.) As to the who-can-win game, I can't handicap it. I vote for the person I want as Prez
C: (0.998%) T: @Luvina_things @SqwareState @jeffnoble14 @Timcast EVERY half-white mixed-race person you can anme identifies as their non-white half. Obama, Kaepernick, Key &amp; Peele. Then you have white people like Elizabeth Warren, Shaun King, and Rachel Dolezal who literally pretend to be other races. OBVIOUSLY minority status is an advantage
C: (1.000%) T: I donated to Elizabeth Warren's campaign. I'm totally cool with the people knowing that.
C: (0.987%) T: @redsteeze Follow the facts, wherever they may lead. Don't stop making equivalences. Show what Elizabeth Warren's tweets, or sayings, or speeches inspired the murderer.
C: (0.987%) T: @eclecticbrotha Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum of just using the Democratic Party to run
C: (1.000%) T: Dangerous? These are names in the public record. All donors to all public campaigns should be easily accessible to the public. Oh - and, by the way, progressives would like to see a list of donors to Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/zwipEGvxX1
C: (1.000%) T: @Dominat73594926 @TheMarkPantano Will it keep you home to let Elizabeth Warren win?
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Nuker, the El Paso shooter did it because of YOUR people raising their hands for free healthcare for Illegal invaders. How come you don't mention the Dayton shooter being a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, not to mention your jackboots ANTIFA?
C: (0.999%) T: @socksnsandal @RobertMCle @Cernovich @NonWhiteHat Come try a SNEAK ATTACK like that on me you sissy snowflake dressed in black. I’ll beat you so hard that you’ll have PTSD flashbacks thinking Elizabeth Warren is fucking you with her giant Native American cock... AGAIN.
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Dayton Ohio shooter was Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporter. Did you blame Obama for the gay night club shootings?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren proposes $85 billion grant for expanding rural internet access https://t.co/3qsfL1nVu0
C: (1.000%) T: It’s getting harder and harder to make it in rural America, and opportunity is drifting further and further out of reach.  It’s time for a change.   https://t.co/6dNrsOeAdB
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC I have proudly donated to Amy McGrath, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren. I donated to Barack Obama's campaigns. I donated to Beto O'Rourke's senatorial campaign.   Go ahead and out me. I am not ashamed of a single penny that has gone to good candidates.
C: (0.994%) T: @CaroleFawcett1 @MitchKSmith Are you people so dumb to not know that the shooter in Ohio was a leftist,antifa,pro Satan, pro Elizabeth warren and Bernie Sanders?
C: (0.994%) T: If we started a gym with the premise that all profits go toward Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, we could raise so much money for her from the socially-conscious-but-have-never-been-invited-to-Fire-Island-gays.
C: (1.000%) T: @artificialidea This is a bit complicated for Twitter, but I agree that antifa has absolutely nothing to do with the actual goals or aims of liberalism.  I'll note that you do not feel the need to defend Elizabeth Warren here, and you should think about why.

C: (1.000%) T: "... US presidential campaigns tend to run lean and work with short timelines. Tech-enabled tools allow teams to move fast while fostering more collaboration among workers." https://t.co/ghYk2UZk57 @quartzatwork
C: (0.994%) T: Trump - Dayton Shooter  was a fan of Bernie, Antifa, Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/P5GJuH5f67 via @YouTube.   @TheMurdaMil
C: (1.000%) T: @LexSportsCards @TheGlare_TM @ddale8 The Dayton murderer shot his sister and others in a bar because Elizabeth Warren wants to pay preschool teachers more money? Quite an impressive leap you’ve made there.
