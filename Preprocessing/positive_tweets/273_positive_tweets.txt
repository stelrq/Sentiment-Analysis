C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden With respect blame the President for El Paso. Not Elizabeth Warren for Ohio, remember when democrats blame S.Palin four G. Giffords. Remember they tried to he was a White supremacist even then, that nut turned out to be a democrat! What about the pulse shooting or Boston bombing https://t.co/gkDHr62fN8
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol @gtconway3d Why are you hating on Elizabeth Warren? I think she‚Äôs cool
C: (1.000%) T: @charley_ck14 @CNovelo66 @grociodeL You're gonna say they were republicans, save that crapp for your lot low IQ Democrat voters, who don't know any better.  El Paso shooter, was environmentalist whack job, who was full of hate and Dayton Ohio shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter!
C: (0.989%) T: @BillKristol We all deserve Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @johnpavlovitz @realDonaldTrump You better check again. It was two DEMOCRATS that got people killed, one of whom is a big Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie fan. Neither was a Trump fan.
C: (0.722%) T: Donald Trump says the Dayton shooter was a 'fan' of Elizabeth Warren. Her campaign says that's a distraction. https://t.co/E7RVD1xMLG via @BostonDotCom
C: (0.544%) T: @BillKristol They deserve Elizabeth Warren ??? They deserve.... Am I missing something here?
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC I give to Elizabeth Warren monthly. I give to Planned Parenthood and The Southern Poverty Law Center monthly, and The Interfaith Alliance quarterly. I give to other candidates and organizations on occasion. Just putting it all out there!
C: (0.998%) T: @KarlRove 1 both Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders ‚Äúincited‚Äù Ohio shooting and Steve Scalise shooting respectively. Republicans don‚Äôt stoop to that but being fair, if they‚Äôre blaming Trump, check this out: El Paso shooter said Harris&amp;other Dem candidates provoked him by wa...
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC The Ohio shooter was a Elizabeth Warren admirer and antifa.  Antifa beats gay men.  Where is the moral outrage AOC?  Stop name calling and do your fucking job.  You are no better then them by calling people racist. Go watch the malcom x interview about liberals.
C: (1.000%) T: Good polling approach for early #Dem2020: not who "won", but the +/- favorable change for each candidate. By this measure #ElizabethWarren  dominated 2nd #DemDebate as much as 1st, #CoryBooker up as expected, #Biden did not get a boost like some thought https://t.co/FR977wcSjx
C: (1.000%) T: This is such a great read. https://t.co/MmpwRfdYPL
C: (1.000%) T: The fact that Elizabeth Warren is the chosen candidate of @FullFrontalSamB is just another reason to support Bernie over her
C: (0.740%) T: @ndrew_lawrence And the ones shot in Ohio were shot by an Elizabeth Warren supporter.   So what‚Äôs your point?
C: (0.985%) T: @brianstelter What about the Elizabeth Warren and Antifa supporter who went on the shooting spree in Dayton???? #StopTheBias
C: (0.826%) T: So tired of misinformed folks saying the El Paso shooting was because of Trump. News flash he was ANTIFA ELIZABETH WARREN LIBERAL.
C: (1.000%) T: @SenSanders Maybe we shouldn't allow speakers at Colleges that charge $400,000 an hour. That's what Senator Elizabeth Warren gets paid from Harvard.  Hypocrisy at it best!!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @mvega961 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Clarify: I'm not a Beto supporter. I'm not American. I was commenting that nervous laughter doesn't only affect men.   Your Elizabeth Warren seems to have a sound head on her shoulders. I'm rooting for her :)
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis Well since the Dayton Ohio shooter was a Trump hating, Elizabeth Warren loving liberal I guess we can put the blame for his shooting right at the feet of Democrats.
C: (1.000%) T: 'Trump's Daily Stupid.' All the Stupid Fit to Tweet.   Circulation:  same as @realdonaldTrump's Twitter followers number.  Editions published in real time.  Pursuing newer and greater degrees of stupid to serve your needs for stupidity. @JeffreyGuterman https://t.co/lgyxzcofsH
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ You are such an embarrassment to this country.  I can‚Äôt even put words to describe it.  No one that isn‚Äôt a political hack thinks Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs rhetoric is encouraging these actions.  Only the morons who watch Fox &amp; Friends swallow that
C: (1.000%) T: @politico Did any of you assholes ask him why his boss just tweeted about the Dayton shooter ‚Äúsupporting Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren‚Äù? Jesus, you‚Äôd think trained journalists could handle pointing out blatant hypocrisy when it‚Äôs happening in real time.
C: (1.000%) T: President Donald Trump insinuated a direct connection between the Dayton shooter and Democratic Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday.
