C: (1.000%) T: Drumpf's fuckface, trust-fund sponging spawn @DonaldJTrumpJr, hectoring Elizabeth Warren about real world accomplishments, has got to be the most gut-splitting hilarious shit I've seen on the intertoobs in a long time.  #DumDumJr https://t.co/xQYCCvO9qv

C: (0.526%) T: @CNNSotu @jaketapper Dangerous? @jaketapper seriously, any thoughts on Elizabeth Warren pushing the debunked lies surrounding Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, MO, 5 years ago.

C: (0.986%) T: @RealDonaldJTr19 Junior is being really snarky toward Elizabeth Warren. Grow up, Junior.
C: (1.000%) T: @LizMair This is nonsense. 1)Elizabeth Warren is not the same as Bernie Sanders. Warren is a capitalist who wants to make Capitalism work. Bloomberg is not running himself because his ideas are behind the curve. Who cares who he's going to vote for?
C: (1.000%) T: Whenever I see chatter stating Elizabeth Warren is too extreme to win a general election, I think of stuff like this: https://t.co/YQJCOR4TK0 https://t.co/Icmn4DIrNM

C: (1.000%) T: @cat19_s @ElmaAksalic @thehill üòÇdon‚Äôt think Kamala Harris is going to be the Democrat nominee. It looks like it‚Äôs gonna come down between Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete
C: (1.000%) T: @DraftTulsi I also find it telling that my previously endorsed politicians Bernie and Elizabeth warren are not simply endorsing @TulsiGabbard ; it makes me think they are now insiders
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @IowaStateFair Is Elizabeth Warren willing to commit to a nationwide watershed infrastructure project sending water Westward? Diverting water to the Southwest will create permanent jobs reduce or eliminate homelessness.
C: (0.994%) T: @Animeking527 @progressiveer @sexyhotnerd @BernieSanders Yeah check him out in our #CandidateSupporterDebate on 9/1 on my channel @TheHillofRoses where he‚Äôll be representing Andrew Yang as he goes against a nominated supporter for Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard and Elizabeth Warren (maybe).

C: (1.000%) T: @RichardLui There‚Äôs your difference between Warren and everyone else. Ask Elizabeth Warren a question and she‚Äôll answer THAT question, not go into some speech about something else. She‚Äôs not afraid to answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: @LizMair Immediate Bullshit called: Elizabeth Warren is 100 times better than any candidate and with all due respect, Bloomberg can take a hike.
