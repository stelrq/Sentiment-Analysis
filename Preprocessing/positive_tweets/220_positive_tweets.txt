C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist - CNNPolitics https://t.co/BEvm8czJsP
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN So CNN, if there is so much white supremacy, why did Elizabeth Warren have to lie and say she was Native American to get the privilege she got monetarily at a University? Why is Beto trying to act Hispanic? Sounds like brown privilege to me.
C: (1.000%) T: This profile of Elizabeth Warren as a teacher is just fascinating — got me thinking about my own pedagogy. https://t.co/6x1fyXiGpQ

C: (1.000%) T: @perrydesigns1 @washingtonpost One of the killers was a big Elizabeth Warren fan.  Furthermore, the El Paso shooter acknowledged that Trump would be blamed for it but his ideology was very different than Trump's.
C: (0.989%) T: @BillKristol @DevinCow The country deserves Elizabeth Warren. God willing.
C: (1.000%) T: @LindseyGrahamSC One thing we know for sure, The Republican party offers no plan, no direction, no foreign policy, just tax cuts for 1%! Call Elizabeth Warren, you &amp; Balonia can plagiarize hers!

C: (1.000%) T: @SenSanders Attention Bernie supporters ,Please make sure to say Tulsi Gabbard when the pollsters call you this month. DNC is actively trying to cheat her out of the debates.We need her to get above 2% so she can be an attack dog for Bernie against Kamala and Elizabeth Warren #Bernie2020

C: (1.000%) T: @HairyPotter79 @ghazghaz_ @washingtonpost Using your criteria Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton. AOC is responsible for the Washington ICE firebombing and attempted officer killings. You need to include those if that’s the standard.
C: (1.000%) T: Rebecca Traister is easily one of my favorite writers (Good and Mad was a blitz read), and damn it she should be yours, too. https://t.co/EtOuN6pOSN
C: (1.000%) T: So, the shooter's favourite political figure was Elizabeth Warren! He described himself as a "Socialist/Leftist" &amp; was in regular contact with various Antifa members! That undoubtedly radicalised him even further! Yet somehow Trump's to blame apparently! #TrumpDerangementSyndrome https://t.co/hArVgyhSTN

C: (1.000%) T: @rhonda_harbison @Scavino45 Get your facts straight, yes they were quoted. As well as  quoted from AOC and Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump the Dayton shooter has  a Twitter feed that was “supportive of antifa, supportive of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders.”

C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol @DevinCow You always show your truth with your subtle digs. People like you and Ross and Romney et al must pay the same tax rate that I do. Period. If Elizabeth Warren is the best candidate to make that happen, then I hope she wins. Don't pretend that you are middle class.
C: (1.000%) T: The Elizabeth Warren you elect is the Elizabeth Warren you deserve
C: (1.000%) T: @LibTearsRCool @geezer_julius @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @OANN https://t.co/EZnAhhOORl It did not affect where she was accepted to. It's been proven.
