C: (1.000%) T: @alshipley @aedwardslevy Hmmmmmm good for Elizabeth Warren tho. I'm seeing on the internet more outlets such as Fox, Maher (yuck), and MSNBC wanted to talk to her after the debate tho
C: (1.000%) T: On Elizabeth Warren being the ideal teacher we all learn about in teaching seminars (and using what are really decolonising methods at Harvard Law): https://t.co/XrMbO6Cyc0
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden Please please please step down and back Elizabeth Warren. Can you imagine how awesome that would be if you would do that?‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
C: (1.000%) T: @SenGillibrand Daytona Ohio shooter was a Democrat he's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren he liked antifa and he believed Alexandria acosta's words about there being concentration camps at the border what's the matter cat got your tongue with that one not going to repeat that one are you https://t.co/5mAQmnGLz9
C: (0.992%) T: @fatttkattt @AOC Your beloved MSNBC and CNN have already given background info on the shooter; google it.  Poke aka Elizabeth Warren, but you already knew that, didn't you.
C: (1.000%) T: Whatever you think of ‚Å¶@ewarren‚Å© and her policies, you can learn a lot about great teaching from this story.  https://t.co/HcoOZDZBhG
C: (1.000%) T: Interesting fact ignored by fake news. shooter in Dayton Ohio was a big fan of Elizabeth Warren writing extensive praise of her policies. Oh course this is not covered since it contradicts the narrative that all shooters are right wing. Turns out this guy was a dem socialist.
C: (0.999%) T: @oliverdarcy Can't have it both ways bro if Trump is responsible for El Paso Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton.  Is your brain so clouded you don't recognize your obvious bias??
C: (0.977%) T: Bernie and Elizabeth Warren are polling 2nd and 3rd behind Biden in the RCP averages.    Why are the Russians targeting @KamalaHarris ? https://t.co/m8Mp0zl7ck
C: (0.616%) T: @charliekirk11 Elizabeth Warren didn't advocate hate.  It's sad when people aren't smart.
C: (0.994%) T: I've donated to the following candidates:  Hillary Clinton Jay Inslee Elizabeth Warren Pete Buttegieg Beto O'Roarke Barack Obama Kamala Harris  I'm not ashamed. I don't care who knows.
C: (1.000%) T: LISTEN UP FOLKS!!. The Ohio shooter (Connor Betts) is a REGISTERED DEMOCRAT! His bestfriend said that he was ‚Äúdefinitely not a right-leaning person. His political views definitely leaned to the left.‚Äù Betts also is a self-described "...leftist Elizabeth Warren supporter."
C: (0.574%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Oh, quit it. Stop trying to point fingers. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren do not engage in hate speech against people based on their race or where they come from. YOU do. Your racist remarks are part of the issue.
C: (1.000%) T: I guess this now means Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren needs to be taken off the ballets, according  to democrats policy?  üôè‚ù§üë∂üá∫üá∏üáÆüá±‚úåüòá https://t.co/AMKZcBXBiA https://t.co/b2DFMldxsj
C: (1.000%) T: @ChuckRossDC Figliuzzi forgets that the Ohio shooter was a Satanist who fully endorsed Elizabeth Warren.  Pocahontas has 10 letters. Times 8 equals 80.  80 x 80= 6400.  Yeah, it's kinda like that.  NUTS
C: (1.000%) T: This was honestly one of the most refreshing things I've read in a long time.  https://t.co/b85zancnBD
C: (0.552%) T: @Herbert_L_Reed @bigleaguepol Meaning the NBC reporter downplayed shooter's support of Elizabeth Warren. In case anyone else was confused by the headline.
C: (0.994%) T: @KTLA Elizabeth Warren must be held accountable
C: (0.707%) T: @SenSherrodBrown The Dayton shooter was a radical Dem Socialist, ANTIFA, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders supporter.  Look in the mirror snowflake.  You are the problem you need to eradicate.
C: (0.999%) T: Great idea! For too long ISPs have taken public funding promising to serve roadband rural areas and not followed through.   https://t.co/06pUFvsDek
C: (1.000%) T: grateful to all my profs who have adopted the @ewarren approach: 'I don‚Äôt get up &amp; teach to show how smart I am. I get up &amp; teach to show how smart you are, to help you have the power &amp; the tools so that you can build what you want to build.' https://t.co/IVnCk5lFG2
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr It is public record. Do Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @IngrahamAngle @CNN @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump I guess that means Elizabeth Warren is a white supremacist or is the Indian he‚Äôll I can‚Äôt remember she has lied so often. And what about Bernie‚Äôs comments calling Baltimore a Third world country hmmm I guess that means Bernie is racist. And by that logic the hamburger is too. Wtf
C: (1.000%) T: Did I just donate to Elizabeth Warren because I got an email saying they‚Äôll put my name on a wall? You bet your ass I did
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren and John Russell‚Äôs ears are so close to the ground, they can probably taste the dust.‚Äù  Good organizing is about listening to people. @heyjohnrussell is a damn good organizer and I‚Äôm so proud to be on his team (and of course, @ewarren‚Äôs). https://t.co/xlFeJVHksc
