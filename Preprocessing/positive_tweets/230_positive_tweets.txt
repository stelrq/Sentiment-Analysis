C: (1.000%) T: @BreatheSaltAir I don't want anyone to be hurt.  Elizabeth Warren's pandering for votes she already has won't move her any closer to the White House.  Warren has no prayer of cutting into Kamala Harris's base, which is probably why she bashes cops. Her best bet's to act less impaired than Biden.
C: (1.000%) T: SlimocRATS! Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‚Äòmurdered by a white police officer‚Äô https://t.co/udwtOmJkwp
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren now into single figure odds for POTUS. This piece is from a fortnight ago. https://t.co/GJXnJVtOuI via @paulmotty
C: (0.986%) T: @ewarren Why does Elizabeth Warren keep lying? First her Native Heritage, then Trump being a white supremacist, and now about Ferguson.  What won‚Äôt she lie about
C: (0.988%) T: Since Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is now repeating the LIE that police officer Darren Wilson **murdered** Michael Brown, it's time to revisit one of my most IMPORTANT COLUMNS EVER.   https://t.co/2YOBmOk84D
C: (1.000%) T: white families are going to read this and they‚Äôre going to tell their friends who‚Äôll tell their friends that the washington post fact checked elizabeth warren about michael brown https://t.co/mSVkQIE1c4
C: (0.998%) T: @BeamMeU06088296 @MrJnow @hrdyprty1 @thederekmick @mefbama @realDonaldTrump @CNN The fact that the killer liked Elizabeth Warren is irrelevant. Unless he was shouting stuff about ‚Äúeliminate student loan debt!‚Äù and ‚Äúbreak up the big banks!‚Äù as he was shooting people, then his choice for president has no correlation to his murderous impulses.
C: (1.000%) T: @RudyGiuliani I notice you never talk about Beto O'Rourke, Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris, Rudy.  Do you just have a thing about Joe, or did the Kremlin assign each of you guys a target? https://t.co/p3kAP8bkFI
C: (0.802%) T: @marklevinshow Lol! Elizabeth Warren a woman of color üòúüá±üá∑ SAVE OUR COUNTRY!! Keep Lizzy Warren in solitary confinement https://t.co/9lLsLvpKXw
C: (0.993%) T: @SteveKornacki I'd rather see Joe Kennedy running for a Senate special election once Elizabeth Warren becomes the Democratic nominee
C: (1.000%) T: No one need #RacistTrump 2020 let Elizabeth Warren run the country. Trump is a disgrace to man and mankind he's caveman stupid.

C: (1.000%) T: Wow I‚Äôd like to congratulate @1_charlee on her new job as chef for presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. Keep up the great work, looks DELICIOUS https://t.co/m8y4YoxofC
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Who ya gonna call?  Elizabeth Warren, said NOT a single person in Hong Kong.
C: (1.000%) T: "Right now, very little is known about how gun purchasers respond to excise taxes." Legislation introduced in 2018 raises some of the same questions posed by presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's recently announced plan to reduce gun violence. https://t.co/GhKQGiqDxo

C: (0.975%) T: me &amp; bae going door to door telling voters about elizabeth warren‚Äôs plan invest in rural america https://t.co/QeSHIxXRFi
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete would be the perfect together on the the same ticket for 2020.   It would have to be Elizabeth Warren for president since America is presently too Homophobic for Pete.  Give Pete like 8 years then have him run!
C: (0.994%) T: #KHive #KamalaHarris2020   @blackwomenviews  @Wonderbitch81  @NaphiSoc  @notcapnamerica  @flywithkamala  @VoteKamala   What's your top three candidates so far? Mine, ranked from highest to lowest:  1. Kamala Harris 2. Elizabeth Warren 3. Julian Castro
C: (1.000%) T: @markbspiegel I love the hilarious self-beclowning claims of out-argued white Democrats that they're victims of ethnic slurs! Now NAMES are ethnic slurs to them when they get embarrassed.  Elizabeth Warren:  "The name Pocahontas is an ethnic slur!"  Cuomo:  "The name Fredo is an ethnic slur!"
C: (0.981%) T: @JRudiani @MSNBC You‚Äôre missing the point... the Ohio shooter was a huge socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren. Should we blame warren? No. Mental illness and ramped up media hysteria is to blame.
C: (0.988%) T: Fake Indian Elizabeth Warren(D) &amp; Fake Black Kamala Harris(D) &amp; Fake Hispanic "Beto" Push Racially-Incendiary Conspiracy Theory That Michael Brown Was "Murdered;"  No Calls for Deplatforming, and In Fact No Criticism or Even Coverage By the Media https://t.co/FHWT2jPZX7
C: (0.994%) T: Here‚Äôs who I‚Äôll vote for:  1. Elizabeth Warren 2. Bernie Sanders  That‚Äôs it. Everyone else stake out a senate race.
C: (1.000%) T: @PamKeithFL How do you think an Elizabeth Warren as Democratic nominee, with her open borders policy, do in Texas? If she is the nominee we lose the State of TX and other red-state Senate contests. When will people realize: Beto is our best shot to beat Trump and flip the Senate!
