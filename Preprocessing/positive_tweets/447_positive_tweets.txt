C: (1.000%) T: @brianstelter Hey Brian, maybe it was after we learned that the Dayton shooter is a big time liberal that loves Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: ``To enact her plan, Warren hopes to first pass a federal law preventing state-level restrictions that have hampered municipalities that want to pursue a public internet system.''  https://t.co/igeJpDnhFN  For those who do not know, in many states laws have been passed that ...
C: (1.000%) T: @rudepundit Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Joe Biden, Jay Inslee, Amy McGrath and Jaime Harrison. Amounts range from $3 to $125. Some because I strongly support them, others because I want to keep them on the debate stage. No shame.
C: (1.000%) T: @Deena_Zaru The Dayton Shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and the domestic terrorists of Antifa. No surprise Antifa is lying in wait for our President there, with MSM pushing their political agenda in the aftermath of mass murder.
C: (1.000%) T: @Malik3G5 @m_nwwn1 @daveweigel I like them both a lot and I'm pretty sure that most Bernie Sanders supporters have Elizabeth Warren ranked at #2 &amp; vice versa. They are the two most progressive candidates, I think they are both very likeable, and I believe that both of them would do a terrific job as president.
C: (1.000%) T: What an Awful #POTUS  "This person supported¬†Bernie Sanders, Antifa &amp; Elizabeth Warren¬†I understand nothing to do w/President Trump," he said, speaking to reporters on the White House South Lawn, referring to 2 of the 2020 Democratic candidates &amp; the left-wing, anti-fascist group
C: (0.987%) T: @JulianCastro Is that why the Elizabeth Warren supported killed in Ohio??  The Bernie Sanders supporter in DC?  Fraud.
C: (1.000%) T: The shooter in Daytin Ohio was in a band that made and performed songs about sexually assualting women  But Trump said he supported Elizabeth Warren. Sounds like a spin job to me.
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Why not talk about the Dayton shooter who followed Elizabeth Warren? You and your friends only find what fits y‚Äôall narrative. Your a disgrace to what it means to be an American
C: (0.996%) T: @VolpeZack @TrumpWarRoom Trump didn't do this, not even close. Should we blame Elizabeth Warren? Her supporter was a shooter. https://t.co/Fbm4ivJEfJ
C: (1.000%) T: oh i totally forgot that Elizabeth Warren is constantly attacking and dehumanizing women  goddamn Charlie and his followers have no integrity https://t.co/og5IDlEHuT
C: (1.000%) T: @RepMaxineWaters Was it the Elizabeth Warren follower you're calling a white supremacist? Yeah. Stop labeling and start HELPING the @POTUS  fix things. You're the one who called for anarchy! Now you think people will listen to you blame the President? No. We blame the shooter. üá∫üá∏ #MAGA #WalkAway
C: (1.000%) T: Warren has a plan and it sounds pretty good to me!üëçüá∫üá∏ https://t.co/QXfKTz7HNl
C: (1.000%) T: @grumpybirdieS ... do you think I like Elizabeth Warren?
C: (0.988%) T: I support this.  https://t.co/cDw3hxKEIt
C: (0.981%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Weren't you talking about the shootings in Dayton Ohio which he was for the Socialist agenda and talked about Elizabeth Warren and many others in your party and you're responsible for that one aren't you
C: (1.000%) T: @ThatRandom18 @hedpsaiko @jenreyes83 @burkemm84 @VenusBitchTrap @msreinab @sequinjumpsuits Can you tell me where the Dayton murderer used Elizabeth Warren's violent rhetoric to justify his crimes? I'll wait while you look for something that doesn't exist. Possibly like you.
C: (1.000%) T: How Elizabeth Warren plans to reboot the farm economy. A ‚Äúfull out effort‚Äù to decarbonize agriculture. #ElizabethWarren would pour $15 billion each year into a USDA program that pays farmers to adopt #conservation practices.https://t.co/DaLdr4Oq4x
C: (1.000%) T: @AnnieMPeterson @USATODAY The Dayton shooter was an Antifa member and Elizabeth Warren supporter. Dayton perp also a registered (D). The El Paso shooter was a Progressive White Supremacist who wanted universal income and universal health care. Interesting how the Democrat Media Complex ignores this info.
C: (0.995%) T: @adamcbest Well the dayton shooter was a hardcore Elizabeth Warren supporter soooo.....
C: (1.000%) T: This is a great plan from @SenWarren and something that we have advocated for in the past. It was also a plank of @JuliaCarmel__ state-level tech platform. https://t.co/GXeIme0LcW
C: (1.000%) T: They're normalizing mass shooters to make them just an acceptable part of the discourse. Year from now the NYT will publish a piece equating 20 people murdered by a guy in a MAGA hat to Elizabeth Warren saying fuck at a campaign rally and lamenting how toxic politics have become. https://t.co/QZym4V6wTU
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren unveils $85 billion proposal to guarantee high-speed internet access https://t.co/qIY7YJ0mdL @ewarren @SenWarren
C: (1.000%) T: ‚Ä¶‚ÄúConveying information; inviting in people who feel shut out; making stories, syllables, letters clear and legible ‚Äî this is precisely, Warren says, ‚Äòwhat a good teacher does.‚Äô‚Äù  https://t.co/tHwPMWm22S
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren We must put armed Guards at every School to keep these killers out. NO MATTER What GUN LAWS you pass the Criminals will have &amp; get Guns. Elizabeth Warren wants to keep Law abiding citizens from being able to protect these kids, themselves &amp; others. KILLERS DO NOT OBEY GUN LAWS.
