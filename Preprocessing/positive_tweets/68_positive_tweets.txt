C: (1.000%) T: @columbiatexan There are folks out there who think Elizabeth Warren ignoring Trump like she is now, will work in a G.E.  They are full of shit.  She's doing it now because he baited her and won.  In a G.E. that strategy changes.

C: (1.000%) T: @MeddlinMegs @Jamesmiltonray @RepThomasMassie @PweaseNo Not trashing anyone, in fact standing up for those who aren't high IQ.  What I gave is just one example of how a test can be written to disallow basic rights to a group.  I see Elizabeth Warren is calling for high taxes on guns &amp; ammo.   Great way to disarm the poor.  Another ex.
C: (1.000%) T: We should always watch power. Always.  But can you imagine how good it'll feel to go from a President Trump to a President Elizabeth Warren? Like sliding into a warm bubble bath after crawling through mud with blood in our teeth for 4 years straight.
