C: (0.976%) T: @SophieSRapp By your logic the dayton shootings should be blamed on elizabeth warren? Reality is NOT your friend..
C: (1.000%) T: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Wednesday night that she believed President Donald Trump was a white supremacist. https://t.co/BmxTi83Lbd
C: (1.000%) T: @JasonOverstreet A male friend told me that he's worried Elizabeth Warren isn't likeable enough to beat 45, that when she speaks, he feels like he's being scolded by his middle school teacher. She's my pick, but this concerns me.
C: (1.000%) T: One of the best interviews to date of @ewarren by the terrific @rtraister who has the ability to uncover what makes a candidate tick. I had not read most of what Traister reports on Warren. #Mustread https://t.co/IsgI80zP5y
C: (0.994%) T: SHE FORGOT TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR SHE RAPED THE CHEROKEE NATION Elizabeth Warren calls Trump a white supremacist  https://t.co/3RztqKtGzW
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist — and does ‘everything he can to stir up hatred’  #p2 #tcot #LockTrumpUp #LockHimUp #ImpeachTrump #TrumpsTerrorists #RapistTrump #RacistTrump #RacistGOP https://t.co/4mwbjntUGq
C: (1.000%) T: The vast majority of his “manifesto” is leftist tropes. Enviro-wackadoodle garbage, universal basic income language plagiarized from Andrew Yang, support for socialized health care, anti-business rhetoric straight from a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren speech. Just a mess. https://t.co/XOOTgllaAz
C: (1.000%) T: @jjlibboyIsuck @EJohns_1004 @drmistercody You should read before you respond ... the DAYTON, OHIO shooter was a Left-leaning, Elizabeth Warren-supporting, Pro-Antifa Atheist.  In fact, most of the mass shooters have leaned left.  Problem is that when they do, Media gives them little attention.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is amazing, even more amazing, Council Bluff coming out to make BIG STRUCTURAL CHANGE! #thR1ving  🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 https://t.co/bjbVmt8aIm
C: (0.585%) T: https://t.co/gJVJFG4qsx Elizabeth Warren’s plan to shift government resources away from Big Ag to help family farmers (all while combating climate change)
C: (1.000%) T: @houtz @domojackson7 Are you blaming Elizabeth Warren and Antifa for the Dayton shooting? Because I'm not sure if you are aware, but that coward was not a Trump supporter. Actually leaned far left. That won't fit the narrative though. Everything is Trumps fault, because #OrangeManBad
C: (1.000%) T: @axios Beto, again, proving himself to be the leader that America needs. The others have followed him on many points, just like Elizabeth Warren didn't have the guts to say it until Beto led the way.   #PresidentORourke #Beto2020 #NewKindOfPolitics #PoweredbyPeople
C: (1.000%) T: I genuinely believe that the Democratic nominee will be either Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, or Bernie Sanders, and that the remainder of the field are merely auditioning to become their eventual running mates. Tulsi appears to be going all in on becoming Joe's #2 if you ask me... https://t.co/IfgADUq0T3
C: (1.000%) T: Senator Elizabeth Warren's climate risk disclosure bill is politics-as-usual, not a serious proposal to address an important problem @EIRPenergy @CFTNI @TheNatlInterest  https://t.co/2mzXvU9aAp
C: (0.980%) T: @MSNBC Elizabeth warren and aoc are responsible for the Dayton shooting and all leftist violence
C: (1.000%) T: @CDonatac @Mac33Cam1 @ImaCruzn @zoomernational @jonallendc @TulsiGabbard @Bencjacobs The Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren. Clinton was endorsed by a grand wizard of the KKK Is it accurate to say that all Warren supports mass shootings and that Clinton supports the KKK?
C: (1.000%) T: it is absolutely DESPICABLE THAT DEMOCRATS USE THE RECENT TRAGEDIES TO RAISE CAMPAIGN MONEY&gt; just goes to prove that the left will resort to anything to gain power beside the old worn-out race card. BTW: they failed to mention that one shooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.658%) T: @robreiner That doesn't prove Trump is racist they could have just been a Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren supporter like the maniac terrorist in Dayton Ohio
C: (0.999%) T: @SKCavazos @The_Unggoy_King @CuomoPrimeTime @cameron_kasky @thejtlewis The Dayton shoot also wrote saying he he was a socialist far left and was a supporter of Elizabeth warren. Now is she to blame for the shooting ? Don’t think so but the MEDIA doesn’t tell you this stuff
C: (0.511%) T: @BetoORourke And the Dayton shooter was inspired by Elizabeth Warren's racist and divisive speech?  Your rules. Deal with it.
C: (0.544%) T: @Gizmodo ...Elizabeth Warren has a plan to combat " evil ISPs "...is this the same internet, that Al Gore help " invent "  ??
C: (0.987%) T: @america_vest Great news for Elizabeth Warren! https://t.co/CS8ym1nlil
C: (1.000%) T: You mean universal Broadband access across the United States at the government controls, right? Just who is Elizabeth Warren pandering to with this "free" item? That would destroy internet companies who make jobs/services for people... https://t.co/houJNsIGth
C: (1.000%) T: @trish_regan They are ESPECIALLY needed in our society more than ever. You have no right to tell me how to defend my family against the likes of the Bernie supporter who tried to kill GOP congressmen the Dayton shooter &amp; Elizabeth Warren supporter or a white crackpot supremacist
C: (0.998%) T: You are such a liar Elizabeth Warren. Socialism-communism kills people because they were disarmed first. You are breaking your oath to our constitution and are not fit for president. Go suck an egg. https://t.co/OGtCnr66gK
