C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN The Walmart shooter was quoting AOC in his manifesto and that the Ohio shooter was a big fan Elizabeth Warren the left needs to realize that they too are part of the problem.  When elected officials like you spew their hatred of America  it just makes it worse. #LoveItOrLeaveIt
C: (1.000%) T: @RyanAFournier Couldn't you both be right? Left wing, Elizabeth Warren supporting, white supremacists exist in all likelihood.
C: (1.000%) T: @VABVOX @GOPLeader @RepCummings @RepAOC @RepRashida @IlhanMN @AyannaPressley I feel the same way when Trump harasses Elijah Cummings, Elizabeth Warren et al. Do you recall why Michelle Obama made that statement?
C: (0.985%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You are an evil bastard. Why do you keep ratcheting up the language even after the President comes out with unifying words! Dayton crazy was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Why? Our President can go anywhere in this USA üá∫üá∏ ! https://t.co/J4QkHfARBf
C: (0.975%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Elizabeth Warren isn't a racist nor does she incite hate or violence! Also that person in Dayton,Ohio is a #DomesticTerrorist no matter what side he supported. If you &amp; the @GOP had passed the #BipartisanBill then maybe that POS wouldn't have bought the gun! #GunReformNOW
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Beto u are a fool.Obama had more mass shootings the all presidents b4 him combined. The one shooter this weekend was an Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporter. You are the man of honor who had a hit and run dui back in the day. lol Remember your state is in Trumps country https://t.co/qfkNow1CPG
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre a dope Geraldo...Really dumb &amp; everyone knows it. Why not include Elizabeth Warren and the Antifa boy-lib from Dayton- Someone needs to smack you upside your rock filled head and knock yo ugly ass mustache off. @foxnews needs to terminate you.
C: (0.990%) T: @KamalaHarris killed by a crazy elizabeth warren supporter....can you say it?"
C: (1.000%) T: @MollyJongFast This coming from someone who is likely:  1) Unwilling to admit that biological men posing as women are still men and 2) fond of Elizabeth Warren (who posed as a Native American to land a job at Harvard.)
C: (1.000%) T: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is turning heads in the early voting state with the size of her operation ‚Äî and crowds https://t.co/JSl3ZkCzpt
C: (0.655%) T: @JodySmi37053025 @WhiteHouse I have only seen that he was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren and AOC. I have not found anything indicating that he parroted AOC. I would argue that he was a psychopath long before either Elizabeth Warren or AOC became well known. He was espousing violence when was 15.
C: (1.000%) T: @TorontoStar The Ohio shooter was a socialist Democrat that posted on social media that he would vote for Elizabeth Warren. Oh. https://t.co/lTj7ORRtfj
C: (1.000%) T: @PhuckTrump2020 @ndrew_lawrence @justineking Daytona shooter was in Elizabeth Warren fan, had connections to antifa, and hated Fox news and Republicans.  Can we hold her accountable? https://t.co/btAW8kYmwi
C: (0.999%) T: @JustinR74 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump A Twitter account appearing to be from the gunman who killed 9 people in Dayton, Ohio, showed tweets labeling himself a ‚Äúleftist,‚Äù bemoaning the election of President Donald Trump, supporting Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren encouraging  cut fences of immigrant detention centers
C: (1.000%) T: @nowthisnews @IlhanMN The Dayton shooter was a leftist supporter of Antifa, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. God will not honor DEMONcrats. He will destroy you in his time and place. Have faith in that. Psalm 55.
C: (1.000%) T: I do not typically post about politics &amp; presidential candidates but this article about Elizabeth Warren's teaching practices is a fascinating read. https://t.co/1eRPQBUrrL
C: (0.885%) T: @DiamondandSilk Elizabeth Warren is not going to make it into the White House as our President so don't listen to anything she has to say okay. Her ideaologies are not good either. Not by a long shot!!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren So many Americans are hungering for leadership that connects us, respects human life, supports quality education/health care. . . Can you provide that leadership via  show we can listen to a few days a week via our computers. Call it "Lead Ahead with Elizabeth Warren"
C: (1.000%) T: ‚Å¶@GeorgeWill‚Å©, this sounds a lot like National Socialism.   ‚ÄòNational conservatism‚Äô is ‚ÄòElizabeth Warren conservatism‚Äô https://t.co/MGXKT5zrKf

C: (0.987%) T: Hey, Elizabeth Warren- Open mouth + enter foot = athlete's tongue! https://t.co/xEaOOQSGXB
C: (1.000%) T: @SethAbramson @tampasullivan @Goldsh0es @UNSEATpac @ShotgunZen @PattyArquette @thedailybeast @NYMag You are so full of it.  How about spewing the truth.  Any other tragedy you want to politicise?? Blame Bernie Sanders for the nut that almost killed Steve Scalise or Elizabeth Warren for Dayton shooting.  Have empathy for all instead of turning this into a chea politics.
C: (1.000%) T: @OrganizingPower If you honestly think Elizabeth Warren is significantly younger than Bernie Sanders, go with that. See how that works for you.
C: (0.716%) T: @MrAndyNgo @Piper_Fogle elizabeth warren, fake indian, also despises the police.   she's just fine promoting big lies to get votes.  i'd say more but i'll get banned.
C: (0.967%) T: Hey @voxdotcom @ewarren and @KamalaHarris didn't "get the details wrong". They lied through their fucking teeth. That said, at least this article, surprisingly, corrects the record. Michael Brown was not "murdered". #HandsUp https://t.co/iqc40qW6Wd
