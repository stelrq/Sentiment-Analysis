C: (1.000%) T: @PatrickAKarlson Elizabeth Warren LIKES people. she like meeting them, she likes hearing stories, and she likes having plans to make things better. She needs to apologize and make peace with the Cherokees, and then she is perfect

C: (1.000%) T: @MitchKSmith How have protestors managed to try to tie in accusations of trump racism in Dayton, Ohio? They do know the shooter was an avowed leftist and Elizabeth Warren supporter and a proponent of a leftist antifa violence right? People are just dumb sheep.
C: (0.920%) T: @ndrew_lawrence The Elizabeth Warren and gun control supporter?  That guy?  You‚Äôre  off your rocker if you think anyone but the triggerman is responsible.  For either killing (one by a conservative, one by a liberal).
C: (0.989%) T: @lita_meza13 @LoordyMarie Bernie Sanders is a socialist. Elizabeth Warren is a socialist. So you think that‚Äôs bullshit? But me voting for Trump makes me complicit in white supremacy is legit?

C: (1.000%) T: @kenbaby71 @DottieW08485010 @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO Why did the Dayton killer endorse Elizabeth Warren? Please. Kooks have only two parties to choose form just like everyone else.
