C: (0.911%) T: @brithume @1RealLori Elizabeth Warren knows that Michael Brown was not shot in the back and that this was not the way that it happened but she tries to push hate to stir up her voters like the rest of us Democrats push hate. That's why they're so delusional and hateful and violent.

C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was an Indian. I said yes!
C: (1.000%) T: @h0rngas @AndrewYang Which is a strange comment or way of expressing his belief. Unlike Elizabeth Warren who was very clear. I dont expect an answer tbh, he's a busy man! I also think he's pretty sensible generally.
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery I donâ€™t know if you can get more genuine than Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.997%) T: @wisemanmarie1 @leejneves @armiehammer @sparktherevolt @shneider_kurgan Like an Elizabeth Warren level
C: (1.000%) T: @MissingMichiga1 @washingtonpost By the way of the most recent two shootings, one used rhetoric that AOC started, and the other was a Elizabeth Warren supporter.  Both were registered Democrats, and the El Paso shooter had more in common with Extinction Rebellion than he did anything else.
C: (1.000%) T: @prageru Simply to share this with my socialist teenage friend @cdsmith80 is fantastic! Of course, He would more than likely say Prager U "Tell um heap big lie!"... I think that is a quote by Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.985%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth warren is 1/1024th Native American but 100% Sharpton.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. https://t.co/mjHl2NjMO7

C: (1.000%) T: @TrishaaLoo @JammieWF @ewarren That someone in Dayton was Elizabeth warren. And the one in El Paso was an ecoterrorist who had to pay a fine for the Obamacare mandate and was pissed that all demo candidates wanted to give free healthcare to illegals who have never paid taxes.
C: (1.000%) T: @PoetTLStarr @AOC You do know that JP Morgan Chase donated heavily to the Clinton's Presidential campaign? Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaign as #SenatorForSale and #CongressForSale and for their Presidential campaign too?  @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @TIME @WSJ

C: (0.981%) T: @ewarren This false statement proves Elizabeth Warren:  A. Incompetent.  B. A liar.  C. Unfit to remain a US Senator either way.
C: (1.000%) T: @AP And some of Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s words mirrored language linked to another one of the weekendâ€™s shooters. If youâ€™re looking for who is fanning the flames for such violence you donâ€™t need to look any further than the associated press and anyone else running stories like this
C: (1.000%) T: @JonSummersdc I can see why nobody comments on your Tweets...they're a bunch of BS..I guess Elizabeth Warren "inspired" the Dayton shooter...and Sanders "inspired" Steve Scalise's shooter...see...I can do it too... #Trump2020
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner that quoted left-wing talking points from notable Demâ€™s like socialist Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders, and he was a registered Democrat. But yet POTUS is the racist, the white nationalist &amp; the problem.
