C: (1.000%) T: @JonLemire Should we be shocked that @JonLemire does not mention in his story that the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren and Antifa fan? #GrowUp
C: (1.000%) T: @bulbaboy @DavidLimbaugh If you say that Pres Trump is responsible for the El Paso shooting, do you also say that Sen Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Dayton shooting?  After all, that shooter is anti-Trump and pro-Warren.
C: (0.993%) T: @robreiner With the 9 killed in Dayton, Bernie Sandars and Elizabeth Warren are now supporter of mass murders since it was a democratic supporter of theirs who did the killing. Under his idiotic thinking we should impeach them also then. #CrazyOldMan. Eat a snickers, you think your relevant
C: (0.989%) T: @sltrib Now  do the Dayton shooting and try to pin it on anyone who supports Elizabeth Warren or her policies.

C: (0.995%) T: @matty_angles Was a licensed democrat who supported Bernie and Elizabeth warren. So because he didn’t like Mexicans he’s immediately with trump?
C: (1.000%) T: @Darktionary @CLee83449360 @EricRWeinstein You’re repeating what Elizabeth Warren is saying reality is decriminalize means ANYONE can come to the border be given a citation and sent on their way. You’re misinformed.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren doesn’t care about black people until it’s time to vote
C: (0.523%) T: @CNN "Elizabeth Warren, Democratic Presidential contender and Native American civil rights leader, points to someone elses racial insensitivity while desperately fighting a sunburn and eating mayonnaise sandwiches."  #BlueWave2020
C: (1.000%) T: @robereid @BetteMidler The El Paso killer no more represents Trump than the Dayton killer represents Elizabeth Warren. The liberals running for President should answer @realDonaldTrump’s call to unite and work together instead of politicizing these evil acts of terrorism.
C: (1.000%) T: @jvgraz @FrankConniff I don't think one needs to be a mysogonist to consider Elizabeth Warren to be a phony.  She and Sen Harris do the same Fake Voice About to Break into Tears.  It's phony.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I asked 30 random people today who is Elizabeth Warren here are the results 8 people said Who-10 said a Indian princess and 12 people said she is a lying pandering hack running for President

C: (1.000%) T: Biden is nothing but a politician - his whole life - says whatever he needs to to get elected - no true principles. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren proving to be the same type of character. "Just elect me."  That's all they care about - power!
C: (0.983%) T: @AnnHumbach @GlamspaB @sharpetax @chrissyteigen So I assume with this logic you think Elizabeth Warren murdered the victims in Dayton???
C: (0.767%) T: @joncoopertweets Elizabeth Warren can catch him, and smoke him.
C: (1.000%) T: @PostSurgeOp @jtLOL @ewarren I’ve heard that the twitter user whose handle initials include PSO and tweeted about Elizabeth Warren to jtLOL at 4:31 on 8/9/19 is a pedophile. Good thing I didn’t mention his name in case it’s false, otherwise I might be in trouble...
C: (1.000%) T: @2BeLogical @BanksHarken @JVER1 Adam and eve were made from the dust of the earth.  And when God separated the people that's when different nations were formed.

C: (0.995%) T: @nknkoo @GovMikeDeWine @DaytonChildrens @LtGovHusted @nanwhaley @OhioChildHosp The man is trying to address the problem locally, aka doing his job. Trump didn’t tell Betts to kill people, but maybe Elizabeth Warren or Antifa did?
C: (1.000%) T: Trump "has given aid and comfort to white supremacists" and "done the wink and a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. He's done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country," Warren said. https://t.co/yit5Xc9leU
