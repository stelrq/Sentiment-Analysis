C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The guy from Dayton apparently clung to every word of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @agnesday @Newsweek @AOC @IlhanMN @AyannaPressley @RashidaTlaib If Trump is responsible for El Paso then Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Dayton shooting. The Dayton shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporting democrat. In both cases it‚Äôs not true. Just the ridiculous way people on the left spin things. Always a one way narrative!
C: (0.988%) T: @brianstelter How come you're not reporting that the Dayton shooter was also a supporter of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren???
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: People Who Are Hateful 'Celebrate' President Trump.                                     Does she realize that the shooter supported her???? https://t.co/Xfq87L2Yuw

C: (0.522%) T: @ABC This is ridiculous especially considering the Dayton shooter was a socialist leftist who liked Elizabeth Warren!
C: (0.846%) T: @CityRepAnnello Blaming Trump for the radical extreme right terrorist in El Paso is like blaming Elizabeth Warren for the radical extreme left terrorist in Dayton. Grow up. And you‚Äôre in office? What if there‚Äôs a lunatic that supports you? Are u responsible if they do something terrible?

C: (0.992%) T: @jacksondeese11 Maybe you want to consider that the Dayton shooter was an elizabeth warren supporter that was radicalized by you guys saying these types of hysterical things.
C: (0.992%) T: @AOC @esglaude Time to start reviewing your link to such events! Confirmed: Ohio shooter socialist leftist Elizabeth Warren supporter, another one of yours!
C: (0.997%) T: @CNN @andersoncooper Why are you not blaming the leftist media? The radical left? Antifa? Elizabeth warren? Oh thats right, it doesnt fit your agenda.

C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Actually Cardi, you‚Äôll be shocked to learn that both shooters were leftists.  One strongly supported Antifa and supported Elizabeth Warren.  The other was a environmental nut who was triggered by the DNC debates in which the candidates wanted to give free healthcare to illegals.
C: (0.988%) T: @stephenkruiser I;m trying to imagine a headlline if protestors had followed Elizabeth Warren to her home.  "Racist Mob something or other"
