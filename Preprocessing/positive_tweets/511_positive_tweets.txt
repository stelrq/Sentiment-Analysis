C: (1.000%) T: @CNN ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù @OANN  I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!
C: (1.000%) T: @kkoth @GSarafan Absolutely! But until this happens, people have to live within their means. Your statement is why I support Elizabeth Warren for President.
C: (1.000%) T: @SarahJSover @parliamentbooks @ShayneLeighton I was actually good and checked it this morning after the gym because I knew my Elizabeth Warren bumper sticker should have arrived by now (&amp; it did!) I just have to know I'm getting something other than junk mail to get motivated to check it lol
C: (0.516%) T: Elizabeth Warren is deeply disturbed--a very angry woman; it's unfortunate she has no problem displaying that in public, but, then again, we all got her number with 'that Indian thing'. https://t.co/0g1LvpFgYL
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is offering beer. Time to step up your offer dude. https://t.co/hkTWHaaCB5
C: (1.000%) T: The #MississippiRaids created more jobs for Americans in a single day than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren have in their entire lives. #ICEraids  #GodBlessICE
C: (1.000%) T: Analysis | Elizabeth Warren is surging. This one big question looms over her.  https://t.co/3PvqNUEm5H
C: (0.954%) T: @katiekat1991 @Deena_Zaru You do realize how disrespectful it‚Äôs not our presidents fault you idiot the man the did the shooting was a huge democratic supporter and he hated republicans and loved Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill Actually, people are more divided because of MSM and leftists like Elizabeth Warren. The Dayton shooter (Antifa) supported her and Bernie, yet media is silent &amp; so are the Democrats. Go away liars. We are tired of you.
C: (1.000%) T: I deserve Elizabeth Warren 4 President b/c she‚Äôs fighting 4 every last 1 of us &amp; 4 r planet üåé Every Plan she can &amp; 4 every sector of r economy inc Green New Deal components. I love that she knows rural America &amp; farmers can be front line warriors on climate change! #Warren2020
C: (1.000%) T: We've made real strides with shifting the Overton Window but there's plenty more work to do if people believe that voters cannot genuinely be far to the left of Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/6SG4oDMo46
C: (0.620%) T: @DiamondandSilk Elizabeth Warren just makes up everything she says.  You need to stop hating on our President!!  We voted him in just like you were voted in. Stop the hate!! Elizabeth!!!
C: (0.649%) T: If the powderpuffs worldwide don't like @realDonaldTrump's reactions... quit attacking him! Extremely uncomplicated. ü§î #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder  #LeftistHate #DemocratsAreHypocrites https://t.co/Lkne3igo8S
C: (0.998%) T: @ewarren Just days after Dayton shooter that was a big supporter of Elizabeth Warren you FAIL to call out Antifa and political violence
C: (0.995%) T: @garveystephen1 @mtthffmn @JefferyAdkison @MsgtSmiles @adamcbest If you can show me where the Dayton shooter quoted Elizabeth Warren in his manifesto.
C: (1.000%) T: @atDavidHoffman Stop it. He committed sexual misconduct against 8 women. He forfeited his voice.  We can't tear down Trump, or any other sex assaulter, and give safe harbor to the ones we like.   Besides, we have plenty of strong, if not stronger voices. Elizabeth Warren is one of those voices.
C: (1.000%) T: @kimbob37 @TennantRob @blues2hoops @PolitiBunny @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl @TwitchyTeam @realDonaldTrump @GOP You believe half of the country is racist and you tweeted in agreement of doxing them so they can be attacked.  Your heart is sadly consumed by hate, please let it go. Regarding the shooters, why would a MAGA person support Elizabeth Warren and universal healthcare?
C: (1.000%) T: Andrew Yang is the ninth Democratic candidate to qualify for the Sept. &amp; Oct. presidential debates. Joins Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O'Rourke and Elizabeth Warren. Deadline for Sept. debate is Aug. 28.
C: (1.000%) T: El Paso &amp; Dayton were heart filled warmth for our President. These shooters are filled with hate as their social media platforms show and following of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders not President Trump. Why again a Democratic lie. You are loosing your constituents POS.
C: (0.997%) T: Right. Just like Elizabeth Warren is an Indian üôÑ https://t.co/IYDLtHC1rV
C: (0.702%) T: @lbc360 @Twitter Wear a Bernie or Elizabeth Warren pin to the interview would be my guess
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke: Trump is a white supremacist https://t.co/7Pi8Ys7uv6 -- Of course he is. He has always been. Just read his own words over the decades, (good genes, etc.) Investigate his actions. See who raised him. DUH!
C: (1.000%) T: @april_s22 @NoahCRothman I think you're mostly right! I do want to note though that the specif details of Warren's plan look a lot different than a nationalized internet monopoly. https://t.co/ZO9xnuuI9n
C: (1.000%) T: @EricTrump @Twitter @Team_Mitch The lady outside the house screaming is in a pic with Elizabeth Warren hugging her , I wish we could leave Twitter , the only reason I joined was because of your dad and the day he stops using this platform I'm done .
C: (1.000%) T: I like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. I‚Äôd be fine with either but whichever one goes up against Trump better win. The world can‚Äôt afford another four years of Trump.
