C: (1.000%) T: I love Coach Kerr but here‚Äôs the thing; it‚Äôs come out that the Ohio shooter was anti-gun, anti-DJT and supported Elizabeth Warren. I‚Äôm not sure this one falls totally on the ‚Äúgutless leadership.‚Äù @SteveKerr
C: (0.980%) T: The #FakeNews and liberals are claiming that @realDonaldTrump is "responsible for the hatred, violence and mass shootings." But the Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, Satanist, and Democrat...so why are they not attacking her and saying she is responsible for that???
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke @elpasotimes @abc7breaking @KTSMtv @BuzzFeed @washingtonpost Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed ‚Äúpro-Satan‚Äù views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren.  He was also very pro gun control....so blame warren?
C: (0.716%) T: @PatGarofalo https://t.co/UfkyaJFRBd  this is not a both sides issue. If you can find one quote from Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren inciting violence I'll listen to you.
C: (0.985%) T: @JulianCastro The shooter in Dayton was a socialist supporter of Elizabeth Warren who was inspired by the Left's Antifa.   #KeepAmericaGreat   Support @realDonaldTrump
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren you have no idea what white natulizam is or what racism is because if you did you wouldn't say that Trump is one.  Or maybe it is becose you know he isn't one but you think if you call him one that your supporter won't be smart enough to realize he isn't
C: (1.000%) T: @ndrew_lawrence You sure about that?  Beware of false information and narratives...   I could say the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan, satanist and socialist but his mental illness and state of mind is what caused him to kill people...
C: (1.000%) T: @AstorAaron I've been donating to several candidates, particularly if they're supportive of smart immigration policies. That includes Amy Klobuchar (great on physicians) and Kamala Harris, Julian Castro and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Rob ran a campaign on ideas for the underserved of the WGA. While I was excited to vote for him, I‚Äôm proud of his decision here. Thank you, Rob, for teaching us how to put the greater good above self. And that a young man can proudly call himself an Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/wvbqQKydjU
C: (0.988%) T: @JulianCastro THE DAYTON OH SHOOTER WAS A SOCIALIST &amp; IN ELIZABETH WARREN'S CAMP, STOP YOUR HATEFILLED RHETORIC PLEASE OR THE ELECTION WILL BE IN TRUMP'S CORNER.
C: (1.000%) T: Hey #Schiffforbrains the shooter in Dayton was a left wing, antifa supporting psychopath who supports Elizabeth Warren.  Time to declare Antifa a domestic terror organization. https://t.co/YjxiRBQQ3V
C: (0.988%) T: @CBSEveningNews @CBSNews And apparently an Elizabeth Warren follower
C: (1.000%) T: @bgmacneill @realDonaldTrump Gee I read the Dayton shooter wanted socialism and wanted to vote for Elizabeth Warren. Where does that fit in?
C: (1.000%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress Your a dumb ass Cristela! What about the other shooter, the antifa, Elizabeth  Warren supporter...funny how little coverage that gets!
C: (0.994%) T: @YetiEye @WilliamShatner The Ohio shooter was a leftist, Elizabeth Warren supporter frustrated socialism isn't here fast enough. So do the 2 negate each other? Craycray's with guns üò™
C: (1.000%) T: @countdown2march @RealSaavedra The Ohio shooter was a self-described socialist and Elizabeth Warren fan. Do we blame her? No-we do not.  We don‚Äôt blame anyone but the shooter.   Maybe you should get to know people before you start telling me the type of person I am
C: (1.000%) T: Kamala Harris (and now also Elizabeth Warren) are the only candidates running that have realistic plans to take serious action on federal gun safety. https://t.co/eDgMoRB0IW
C: (0.987%) T: @Noah_traveling @nypost He also supported Elizabeth Warren and described himself as a "leftist".....
C: (1.000%) T: @atensnut @oldtoothlessli1 @WashTimes Based on how the Dems process info this would make Elizabeth Warren Satan. Right?
C: (1.000%) T: @Skilly84978174 @NatsandBeesMom @repairrestores1 @JoaquinCastrotx @valentine_fa No dipshit. She means like Connor Betts who was pro Antifa supported  Elizabeth Warren and just killed nine people in Dayton......
C: (0.988%) T: @runbkswm1 @TimRunsHisMouth Trump should bring up Elizabeth Warren's follower who killed all those people in Dayton. That's on her if El Paso is on Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: Joe Biden keeps his lead over Bernie Sanders in Democratic 2020 race after second debates - with Elizabeth Warren taking third place from Kamala Harris via https://t.co/NP7O6W7J1M https://t.co/JjHJYHTPcT
C: (1.000%) T: Sophie and I have decided that our donation$, door-belling and calling work will now be devoted exclusively to Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @RealKyleMorris @RealJack ‚ÄúHATE HAS NO PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY‚Äù. Yet they say he is inspiring hate. Maybe Elizabeth Warren should condemn these shootings, since she had a fan of hers complete one. Where are you Liz? Haven‚Äôt seen you lately condemning hate. But Trump is. Funny how that works...
C: (0.786%) T: Elizabeth Warren had another very good debate, poll finds https://t.co/e13ceyEMZp
