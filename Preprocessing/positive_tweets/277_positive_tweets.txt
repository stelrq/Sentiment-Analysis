C: (1.000%) T: @SonofBaldwin I'd vote for Elizabeth Warren. Luckily Williamson and Gabbard have no chance of winning the nom, as I'd have a hell of a hard time voting for them.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow You sound scared, bro. Should be. Elizabeth Warren is unstoppable. She is going to win the presidency in 2020 and restore our democracy.

C: (1.000%) T: And Jeb! had a plan to achieve 4% growth. But I guess you have to be the wonkiest wonk to ever wonk if you want your outlandish, completely unrealistic targets to not be mocked derisively. https://t.co/QGlMfFXIzI
C: (1.000%) T: @Cernovich @gatewaypundit Why not challenge Elizabeth Warren to a push up match off.  Or any other of Yang‚Äôs female opponents.  He might even win.

C: (0.997%) T: @ReaganBattalion @RashidaTlaib @Castro4Congress Reminds me of your Tweet a few days before the El Paso massacre where you posted a photo of Elizabeth Warren and suggested she get a bullet proof vest.
C: (1.000%) T: @TheChris_Dude @Bald_Eagle1776 @ComradeDoyIe Nazism isn‚Äôt solely a extreme right idea and to say that is extremely unfair as if we were to look at the economics of it and etc it would be left also  and any form of extremism is bad hell the Dayton shooter was a satanist who praised Elizabeth warren
C: (0.999%) T: @trevor_carrell @emilyrcastillo @joseeh_1 He didn't have a manifesto, no. But his now deleted Twitter account was full of pro-Democrat, socialist, support of Elizabeth Warren, and tweets that expressed his anger toward the outcome of the 2016 election.

C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Every person who donates to Elizabeth Warren is complicit in stealing Native American identity to fraudulently advance their personal interests and camouflage their venomous white privilege under the virtue of an oppressed person of color.  #scarboroughlogic #completebullshit

C: (1.000%) T: @KKeneally @smh The shooters were democrats. Dayton shooter was to vote for Elizabeth Warren. Kind of destroys your agenda does it not? Let‚Äôs talk about liberal leftist like @AOC Ilhan Omar @AyannaPressley and you who want to defy our constitution.
C: (1.000%) T: If ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù is some powerful advantage in this country... then why did Robert Francis change his name to ‚ÄúBeto‚Äù and Elizabeth Warren claim Native American ancestry???  ü§î

C: (0.997%) T: #WednesdayWisdom So my question is if there's truly #WhitePrivilege why then DID Elizabeth Warren claim to be NATIVE-AMERICAN and why DID Beto O'Rourke take a MEXICAN name? I mean, Beto DIDN'T name himself Bubba O'Rourke, you know what I mean? #JustSaying https://t.co/fAdbpmkA31
C: (0.988%) T: @lufrewoptoo @arlo120 No, the shooter in Dayton was a liberal, supporting the violent group Antifa and Elizabeth Warren.  The guy in El Paso was a racist.
