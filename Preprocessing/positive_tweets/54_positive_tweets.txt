C: (1.000%) T: Julian Castro said he would allow trans women to get abortions... And he moved up in the Democratic polls.  Jay Inslee called Donald Trump a white supremacist and the media praised... Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke https://t.co/2Zbo7Bgdbl
C: (0.903%) T: She blames WALMART? For anybody wondering if gun control advocate Elizabeth Warren ‘wouldn’t stop at ‘assault rifles,’ here’s your answer https://t.co/SbuYaM9BUZ via @twitchyteam
C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren compared having an abortion to “getting your tonsils out.”  This is an attack on the dignity of human life.  No person who believes that should be anywhere near the Oval Office!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren calls Trump a white supremacist https://t.co/3XBYMulvoX #FoxNews Not having workable plans to help our country people like former "Pocahontas" and now "The Great White Buffalo" Elizabeth Warren has to depend on insults!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether or not Elizabeth Warren is a woman of color and will be the next President. I said No.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I was asked today what I thought of Elizabeth Warren, I said she’s a Panderer, and a down out full blown professional LIAR https://t.co/yGSTOtJ2t9
C: (1.000%) T: @JasonOverstreet @ewarren I can hardly stand to listen to Elizabeth Warren. I don't hate her, I don't like her. But her constant fast talking babble has me shutting her off. Sarcasm and fitting more words in a sentence is not a take down. FYI Not a Biden supporter but prefer him over Warren everyday.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren’s steady rise is no accident. Read the inside story of her early-state sleeper campaign and how it may be replicated deeper into the primary calendar. https://t.co/V6CJSnNnMD
C: (0.824%) T: @davidhogg111 The shooting in Dayton was political terrorism committed by an Elizabeth Warren supporting communist  democrat   The leftists are trying to make everyone forget THAT shooting ever happened .DONT LET THEM ! .

C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister Unfortunately, Joe is a retread. He was never able to run to the finish and ever win. I don't think he will last all the way through. The better woman will win. Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.998%) T: @ewarren ..... but I’m Elizabeth Warren, and I don’t even know who I am.  Or, I do know who I am, which is a lying fraud of a human. #MAGA #WalkAway
C: (1.000%) T: @JackPosobiec Libs don’t want this phone unlocked.  It won’t look good for their side  when he’s proven to be a far left, Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @nbeaudrot Elizabeth Warren, like any politician, is laying out what she hopes and plans to accomplish if we the voters fight hard and help give her enough power to do it (via winning the senate, a big margin which will be a mandate, etc).  Totally different.
C: (1.000%) T: "Trump’s Facebook spending is just one indicator of his political strategy...Since January, he has spent $9.2m on Facebook ads – more than that spent by the top four Democratic candidates (Kristen Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren) combined."
C: (1.000%) T: I don't want to see Elizabeth Warren's snapchats...I want to her see trying to figure out how to use the app. Can someone post a video of that?
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR Ask Elizabeth Warren if she supports the direct election of the President by a nation-wide majority.   Then ask her how much time she would spend in Iowa if there were no Electoral College.  Thanks in advance.
C: (0.995%) T: Gonna add Elizabeth Warren to Snapchat https://t.co/SYkkAvEdFK
C: (1.000%) T: @nbeaudrot There is a huge difference between Elizabeth warren’s plan and trumps empty promises.  Trump lies and misleads constantly - think of all the things he promised that he had no intention or plan to get done.  Like Mexico paying for the wall, or the “infrastructure plan” etc
C: (1.000%) T: “‘Nobody wants to be talked down to—nobody.…Good teaching is about starting where you are and the teacher having the confidence in you to know…if you thought about this from a little different perspective, you might move a little bit.’” https://t.co/vy33IgUzE2 HT @Ben_Alpers
C: (1.000%) T: "I don’t get up and teach to show how smart I am. I get up and teach to show how smart you are," Warren says. Many progressives lose voters by trying to show off their smarts. It's a turn-off. Warren offers "belief — in her students, the audience, voters." https://t.co/aQxhbqdICH
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis What happened in Dayton can clearly be laid at Elizabeth Warren’s feet. She encouraged people. She created the climate. She fanned the flames.
C: (0.999%) T: Every winter.  This was sent to me to prove @realDonaldTrump is a racist.  So by this logic, Elizabeth Warren &amp; her supporters really are murderers because the Ohio shooter endorsed Warren...  Fighting perceived hate with hate. ??? https://t.co/6dJP7eKq09
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill What would she say to the candidate the mass shooter supported, Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @NancyTicotin @JasonIsbell You vastly overestimate the influence of POTUS. Tell me, Nancy, exactly how Trump's giving a speech is going to dissuade a murderous Elizabeth Warren supporter from shooting up Dayton, OH? Do you think an extremist who hates Trump's guts would listen?
