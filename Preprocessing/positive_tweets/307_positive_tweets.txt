C: (1.000%) T: When it comes to education and politics, Warren believes: ‚ÄúThe people coming in with structural advantages ‚Äî money, confidence, experience navigating intimidating institutions or plying the powerful ‚Äî should not have more access than those who don‚Äôt.‚Äù https://t.co/W22m2ejDyo
C: (1.000%) T: @AlxThomp @thomaskaplan Didn't Elizabeth Warren tell us that she was a Native American? She looked in the mirror and said she was a Native American! She contributed to the PowWowCookbook! Are we to take anything she says seriously? Really? This is "serious" journo-ing?

This should be disqualifying--&gt; https://t.co/0knff8S30G
