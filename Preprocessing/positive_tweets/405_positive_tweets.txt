C: (1.000%) T: @CBSNews Elizabeth Warren was paid $400,000 to teach one class for a semester.  Gee, I wonder how k12 teachers still can‚Äôt get paid well, while education is so expensive.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoyAnnReid God I hope not. Elizabeth Warren can do better than Kamala.
C: (1.000%) T: @RealMattCouch Elizabeth Warren couldn't run a Snow Cone stand.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs 2% tax on millionaires w/ over $50M would give us free college, free daycare &amp; pay off mounds of student debt. Iowans get it. https://t.co/8pw1rebWiP
C: (1.000%) T: @JackPosobiec Elizabeth Warren's rain dance to bring prosperity.
C: (1.000%) T: Is there anything like being a ‚ÄúWarrenite?‚Äù If not, what are Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs truest fans called? I‚Äôm one of them üôåüèæ
C: (0.996%) T: Elizabeth Warren is my choice https://t.co/reJ6Unxm04
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump should have stopped at the first paragraph. Because the shooters were registered Democrat Elizabeth Warren supporter and Antififa terrorist.
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib (Um, you might want to check you facts. The shithead in Dayton was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren, but keep on with the lies, it seems to be uniting us....)
C: (1.000%) T: Nothing says kill people like telling people you wanna ban guns. I think this kid did it on purpose to protect the trash he really cares about but if he didn‚Äôt you‚Äôre gonna have a hard time pushing the ‚Äúprovoked by Elizabeth Warren‚Äù line. #Dayton https://t.co/MUAXjEVJt6
C: (1.000%) T: And Elizabeth Warren wasn't responsible for the Dayton, Ohio Killings? And Waters, Pelosi, Tliab &amp; Pressely aren't responsible for enticing continued racism &amp; Violence? https://t.co/Wn2LyeN6Cv
C: (1.000%) T: FYI: The Dayton Shooter Was Pro-Antifa and Wanted to Vote For Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/3FeFrbHnn5 FYI: The Dayton Shooter Was Pro-Antifa and Wanted to Vote For Elizabeth Warren The *DEM'S* &lt;HATE &amp; RAGE&gt; and DARK-SIDE POLITICIZATION in the wake of mass shootings IS *EVIL*
C: (1.000%) T: @savelifeearth @gtconway3d Extra creepy today: Conway said on ‚ÄúFox &amp; Friends‚Äù Tuesday. ‚ÄúBecause I see very little, scant coverage of the fact that this Dayton shooter has been confirmed as having a Twitter feed that was supportive of antifa . . . &amp; Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders.‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: @6xkaos When has Elizabeth Warren Tweeted &amp; laughed at shooting your sister at a rally? The El Paso shooter wrote an anti-immigrant diatribe echoing Trump‚Äôs consistently repeated hate speech &amp; drove specifically to El Paso. #FalseEquivalency
C: (1.000%) T: What do you say to that,Cory? Besides,it looks like Elizabeth Warren has more Indian AND black in her than you do. What‚Äôs with the Caucasian skin? Are you actually one of those white supremacists? You sure seem to be ‚Äúfilled with a lot of HATE‚Äù. Especially toward President Trump! https://t.co/fMJkIlpXIp
C: (1.000%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl Hey Joaquin, because I know you want to be fair and balanced I thought I would provide a link to ALL of Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs donors, since her and the Dem rhetoric inspired the Dayton shooter. Fair? https://t.co/Q4dK2Y9Xx0
C: (1.000%) T: @TheHammerr14 @DavidAFrench Kathy Griffin is not Elizabeth Warren. She was roundly condemned for that btw, because it was wrong.  I'm not sure what your point is.
C: (1.000%) T: @1776Stonewall @CoryBooker What do you say to that,Cory? Besides,it looks like Elizabeth Warren has more Indian AND black in her than you do. What‚Äôs with the Caucasian skin? Are you actually one of those white supremacists? You sure seem to be ‚Äúfilled with a lot of HATE‚Äù. Especially toward President Trump!
C: (0.997%) T: @ewarren @rezaaslan @JDScholten Elizabeth Warren proof how fucked up people  can be
C: (1.000%) T: @Debby_Villegas I'll be honest, I think Elizabeth Warren is smarter than she lets on. She looks like a Librarian but I have no doubt she's make other world leaders sit down and listen.
C: (1.000%) T: @KellyannePolls is so mired in her own lies, Gish Galloping and propaganda she cannot see that in Trump's case it is him being supportive of the mass murderers. In Elizabeth Warren and Sanders case it is the result of the mass murderer being supportive of them. HUGE DIFFERENCE!! https://t.co/x5o5wukUF2
C: (0.995%) T: @TRACIEPODGER @Hhdexzzh @BetoORourke Both of those shooters would‚Äôve voted for Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and AOC. Because of their rhetoric about climate change, Big Corp, and Socialism. So you need to check yourself.
C: (1.000%) T: If I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay my student debt, I‚Äôd have chosen a better school and a more interesting but less lucrative major, writes ‚Å¶@semanahte‚Å©  https://t.co/6IgV1Y3r9s
C: (0.984%) T: Michael Bloomberg sasses Elizabeth Warren for digs on the 1 percent https://t.co/Ea8QSLMeQi via @nypost
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren one more vote for you
