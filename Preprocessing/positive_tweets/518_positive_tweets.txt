C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends LOL Pure scum screwed the state of Rhode Island out of 70 million. Caved in a run for the Senate against Elizabeth Warren because He knew She would clobber him
C: (0.985%) T: @EdaDragonetti @justsickoflies @yashar I'm the same amount of Italian as Elizabeth Warren is Indian and I have never heard Fredo as an Italian or Indian slur!üòáüòáüòáüòáüòáüòá
C: (0.993%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to raise taxes on firearms and ammo... San Jose's Mayor wants liability insurance... What say you? #BroeskeandMusson @KMJNOW @ChristinaKMJ  https://t.co/yQ23erxY7s
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has generally been pumping out great ideas at an astonishing speed.  Her plan for trade deals, however, is a rare exception, and needs a rethink.  https://t.co/Q5JqzF0BuY
C: (1.000%) T: Not our first rodeo. In 1913, new income tax applied to 4% of people. Top rate for handful who earned $500K was ‚Ä¶ wait for it ‚Ä¶ 6%. Dems say they will only tax wealthy, but soon you‚Äôll find yourself lumped in with Hampton folks.  Fool me once ... https://t.co/Bmcevm0J56 https://t.co/IVU6mwNfib
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke It's been verified that the shooter was a Dem, and supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. You need to check your propaganda better.
C: (0.988%) T: @lilsarg Connor Betts, Dayton shooter also loved Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/M0yn4B54ak

C: (1.000%) T: @PsychoMetalHed @Rifleman4WVU Isn't it kind of "racist" to falsely assume a particular ethnicity because you think members of that ethnic group are stupid enough to buy it? Asking for Robert Francis O'Rourke and Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: Every minute of this half-hour interview with Liz (@SenWarren) is jaw-droppingly moving. I pray that my fellow Bernie (@SenSanders) fans in particular will listen. Few things could show better why Bernie and Liz are closer than any other two Senators. https://t.co/3bmNcnh5Ja
C: (1.000%) T: @dan_geldon @ewarren Elizabeth Warren will carry the country the back to sanity in this moment in history as the president and uniter we so longingly need and reconize
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren AKA Rachel Dolezal doesn't want to be white only when she feels like itüòÇ https://t.co/eOpkbOsjaF https://t.co/VRL6GMfYCF
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I supported Elizabeth Warren's idea. Wealth tax. The super rich are not paying their fair share!!
C: (0.999%) T: I was wondering this last night. Michelle and Barack Obama, Hillary, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren all released such beautiful statements while Trump took to Twitter to bully Beto O‚ÄôRourke, the Democrats, California... #ToniMorrison https://t.co/flcYcDVbE7
C: (0.981%) T: @RestoringValues @CNN So too goes the Dayton killer as he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  Come on people...when are you gonna realize the only one responsible is themselves.  Figure it out.  You people are the same idiots that take no accountability for your own actions either!! Blame all othersüôÑ
C: (0.988%) T: @GermTex @MitchKSmith Show Elizabeth Warren he was one of her supporters.
C: (0.998%) T: @Still__Pending @AlanMCole Learned a lot about this lately. I imagine it would be hard to get political support for that while we're still getting into all of these conflicts with Russia. https://t.co/qz839M8vjT
C: (0.998%) T: Did the Dayton shooter say he could not wait for socialism because he was promised everything for free by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders?
C: (1.000%) T: @BetteMidler Yup. This time an Antifa, anti-Trump, Elizabeth Warren loving Satanist. Spin this one Bette. White supremicist or liberal whack? https://t.co/brhRB9Q4yp
C: (1.000%) T: @brianstelter Just like the Dayton shooter was a liberal and supporter of Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.989%) T: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and 8 other Senators sent Sundar Pichai a letter urging him to reclassify Google's army of temp workers as full-time employees - Businessinsider India on Mobile https://t.co/jU88FUHUbC
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN You are a shameless POS,  You know that, don't you?  Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have never advocated for violence against ANYONE.  You, on the other hand, have encouraged it at your rallies-- and even promised to pay the attorney's fees!
C: (1.000%) T: @AG_Conservative @Paul_Sacca By all means, publish a list of max donors to Hillary Clinton, or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. I believe all of them would happily own their donations with pride. It says something that only Trump donors desperately want to keep their support on the DL.
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/ZCLmqLSU8Z  Warren has now fully won my vote in the primary.
