C: (0.984%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions No because the shooter didn‚Äôt quote Elizabeth warren you dumb fuck
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I hope someone asks me today if Elizabeth Warren is as authentic as a wooden nickel. The good thing is I already know the answer.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @benshapiro Putting aside how ridiculous it is that a person who's job it is to cover Elizabeth Warren just happened to "randomly" spot her. Why is buying overpriced lemonade something to praise?  BREAKING!! Elizabeth Warren wants praise for supporting capitalism despite being socialist
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says screw your ISP. Let's make the internet a public utility https://t.co/LRqV1mQTun via @DigitalTrends
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner I guess Elizabeth Warren is too because the shooter in Dayton supported her. I see how this works.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/VJydfZ51UZ via @twitchyteam

C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner You sir are absolutely insane.  How come you aren‚Äôt mentioning the Liberal shooter in Ohio?  You know the guy who supported Elizabeth Warren...the ANTIFA supporter.  What, doesn‚Äôt fit your lunatic agenda?
C: (1.000%) T: @washingtonpost @GracieUSA1 I just paid bills but if I had money , he‚Äôll pull the same shit he did on the day he awarded two Native Americans the medal of Freedom when he disrespectfully evoked Elizabeth Warren and called her ‚ÄúPocahontas ‚Äú.
C: (1.000%) T: @Mildredjeanros2 Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed ‚Äúpro-Satan‚Äù views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren. - TRUE https://t.co/SXZ0QpF1zT
C: (0.686%) T: Of all  the Democrats running for president, none matches Elizabeth Warren when it comes to the size of her campaign operation, the crowds at her rallies and the buzz among activists and operatives in Nevada https://t.co/LcSejwaBdg

C: (0.986%) T: @CNN Elizabeth Warren is really 'off the reservation'...
C: (1.000%) T: Using the date, this appears to be the impetus behind my tossing $25 at Warren in 2011. See how much fun you can have information provided to you explicitly for this purpose of publicly discussing it? https://t.co/7HXyJ1RWbm
C: (0.658%) T: It's absurd that Republicans are saying that the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren.  They came to that conclusion over a single tweet that said "I would vote for Warren over Harris".  How f*cking stupid are these people??
C: (1.000%) T: #Trump on TV equalling his influence on the #ElPasoShooter and "Bernie and Elizabeth Warren" on the #DaytonShooter, mentions Antifa 5 times, and says his rhetoric "brings people together and my thoughts include ivuqbdudurusvxkapwfivoshdufuehduwndurwoqowhtvybdufiflkfbwuqyeuwtsvxqz
C: (0.987%) T: @SenWarren Right wing only?  FBI reporter Betts held many politically. In his Twitter feed, he tweeted condemnation of right-wing conspiracy sites and indicated support for Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden The Dayton, Ohio mass killer, Connor Betts, was a radical Democrat socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren.  He wrote: ‚ÄúI want socialism, and i‚Äôll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding.‚Äù
C: (0.962%) T: There is zero evidence that the shooter in Ohio was any in any way a leftist. There's zero evidence he supported Bernie or Elizabeth Warren what this was was Donald Trump taking another opportunity to push the blame for his rhetoric and its actions on someone else. https://t.co/di3Dg5gx3Y
C: (1.000%) T: For those of you with your head in the sand - The Shooter in Ohio was a LEFTIST who supported Elizabeth Warren and Antifa.   What do you say to THAT???
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Funny how the Dayton, Ohio shooted was a left wing liberal that supported Elizabeth Warren. How's your narrative working out now?
C: (0.680%) T: @samstein He said that he didn‚Äôt want the tragedies to turn political but then mentioned Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the same sentence. Liar, liar pants on fire!!
C: (1.000%) T: Trump gives press conference before boarding to fly to Dayton, and politicizes the fuck out of our tragedy:  "He was a fan of Antifa. He was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren."  Not a campaign stunt my ass.
C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is so far 'off the reservation'!!!
