C: (1.000%) T: Again do these Democrat voters look normal to you, no if you‚Äôre uninformed and they‚Äôre on educated about the policies. They will vote for Elizabeth Warren because they want everything for free. The problem is nothing is for free https://t.co/rR3OJ5g5nw
C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a thief and know she is trying to get people killed.  Every mass shooter has been a Democrat and the Dayton shooter was a supporter of Warren and killed because he was inspired by her lies and the hatred that spews from her mouth.  Warren supporters r racist
C: (1.000%) T: @RogueSNRadvisor @DWhittington901 Isn‚Äôt Elizabeth Warren in her 70s? I can‚Äôt see the country who elected the fuck knuckle to be liberal minded enough to elect an openly gay man, let alone a woman...

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Who is the spin master for Elizabeth Warren aka Pocahontas? Based on significant detailed investigation by Obama‚Äôs DOJ her statement is false. Why would someone so high profile make such a statement?
C: (1.000%) T: @J1jonesJones @dwmyst1 I want to see Kamala Harris and Elizabeth warren get rid of knives......

C: (1.000%) T: @TheRevAl Ohio shooter said he was singling out Trump support, and he was known to be at the antifa meetings with the Liberals. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a thief. She has stolen from American Indians her whole life. Now she's lying about Michael Brown's death for political gain. So now she's stealing from that justified police shooting. She knows she's  lying.  Anyone who support Warren is a racist.
C: (0.995%) T: "Shame donors" for printing that they contributed to your father?  Interesting you feel that way.  I don't know anyone who would feel shame if "exposed" for donating to Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren or Pete Buttigieg or Beto O'Rourke or Corey Booker. https://t.co/NMa7fIjOaJ
C: (0.630%) T: @markfm1973 @RyanAFournier The El Paso shooter's manifesto states he was not motivated by Trump. The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders "fan." Mass shootings took place during the Obama years. Mass shooters are sick people. Neither Trump, Warren, Sanders or Obama are to blame.
