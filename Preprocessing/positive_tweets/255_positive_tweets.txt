C: (0.996%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren actually put out a good tweet. üòØ
C: (1.000%) T: Been moving away from Kamala stepping toward Mayor Pete but thinking about boarding the #YangGang train mean time I‚Äôm putting an Elizabeth Warren sticker on the car. Plan to personally catch up to hear them in Iowa. Maybe then I can decide which camp to support. #Democrats2020
C: (1.000%) T: @RoKhanna @BernieSanders @ewarren Elizabeth Warren will cream them! I hope the ticket is E. Warren (president) Bernie Sanders (vice president)! The DREAM TEAM!
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnTeufelNYC @RichLowry @MaxBoot So who exactly are you for now? Elizabeth Warren? Serious question. Life‚Äôs a series of crappy choices.
C: (0.999%) T: @SenecaScalps @kiwidwj @SamHarrisOrg @kathleen_belew You're still trying, and failing, to backtrack from this tweet.  I have to say though, your notion that any genetic material equals an intact population and culture.. is bizarre.  Do you imagine Elizabeth Warren is solace to Native Americans? https://t.co/5aCLjwrRWc
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a total fool who has absolutely no idea what real life is like because she is one of the politically untouchables!!!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @GOPChairwoman @parscale @kayleighmcenany please call on Elizabeth Warren to retract her lie that Michael Brown was murdered. The grand jury in St. Louis said it was a justifiable shooting, as did Obama's Justice Department. You cannot allow Democrat candidates to lie.
C: (0.987%) T: @ewarren Apparently facts dont matter to Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: Hey Andrew, Kamala Harris has equal credentials if not better than Elizabeth Warren and could snap this country back into shape! https://t.co/IjRFMBjifK
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris It doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs on top.  Let‚Äôs make it happen üëåüèº #2020Election https://t.co/cZnkJdQNkl
C: (1.000%) T: @RyanGirdusky Not as racially pure as Elizabeth Warren, I'm afraid. Better luck next time
C: (1.000%) T: As of today 8/12/2019 my top three picks are: Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders Pete Buttigieg https://t.co/abytgMJh2q
C: (1.000%) T: I agree with Christie, I Warren is all the left has they are in a bind. Going to a fun show and big party for the Trump supporters in 2020. LOL https://t.co/Ald5ahQyWb via @Newsmax
C: (1.000%) T: @tribelaw He didn‚Äôt cause the murders no more than your words will cause someone to go out and kill someone. You‚Äôre not blaming Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders &amp; AOC for the Murders in Ohio so that proves you‚Äôre a HYPOCRITE &amp; using the children to make a Point. Prayers for the families
C: (0.995%) T: What are we thinking about Elizabeth Warren?
C: (0.974%) T: Continuing her streak as presidential cycle‚Äôs most policy-rich candidate, #SenElizabethWarren rolled out a package of proposals designed to boost the fortunes of America‚Äôs small farmers, instead of the agribusiness giants who control the sector. https://t.co/cqKzH6tFHf
C: (0.996%) T: @eplacentia @ZackFord What has Elizabeth Warren said that inspires violence? What part of her rhetoric or policy is explicitly encouraging racist, misogynist violence? What has she said that you believe someone could interpret as a call to violent action, even tangentially?
C: (0.996%) T: @maxfawcett "some" good.  https://t.co/cUtJiSWEWa
C: (0.995%) T: @CNNPolitics Elizabeth Warren is a blithering idiot pandering to even bigger blithering idiots.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren does this before every debate. https://t.co/OwmWxk3kWF
C: (1.000%) T: Poll Complete! You widely chose that Elizabeth Warren is the candidate that will bring you closest to the vision #StarTrek puts forth. https://t.co/MtvSD0bxlu
C: (1.000%) T: @Airmit106 @WillieEverstop I do. That was the whole point of my post. Elizabeth Warren is uniquely qualified to LOSE to trump. And that's terrifying.
C: (1.000%) T: @dearydarling @Sulliview @mmfa Question for liberal dipshits like yourself...  Did you feel the #Dayton shooter did the right thing?  He supported Antifa and Elizabeth Warren...being a leftist...are you proud?
C: (1.000%) T: @NYSvegan @daveweigel Don‚Äôt get me wrong; Elizabeth Warren is my candidate right now. But she isn‚Äôt all that much younger. Her looks and behavior show differently, but she‚Äôs 70.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren (basically): IDK why people run for President &amp; their scared of big shit?                                       Me: https://t.co/3YvRG1fYoZ
