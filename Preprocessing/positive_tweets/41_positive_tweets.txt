C: (1.000%) T: In response to a Democratic call to stop selling guns, and ammunition, Walmart took the bold move to remove all violent video games from their shelves. What about automatic rifles, and large magazines of ammunition? Oh, you'll find them on aisles #6... https://t.co/Lmfsg6K98p

C: (0.999%) T: @WFulk4 @CNN The Ohio nut case was a Elizabeth Warren left ANTIFA dude.  So CNN will not report this one.  Liberal bias news.  They donâ€™t report news.  They report on a false narrative.
C: (1.000%) T: @SerranoRose1 @natashakorecki @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Remember we're in a primary and we do NOT have to settle for someone as flawed as Joe Biden. He puts his foot in his mouth daily, his policies are stale, and his past views are absolutely terrible. Bernie Sanders is a greatchoice, Elizabeth Warren too, but not Biden

C: (1.000%) T: @AOC I thought the Dayton shooting was done by a supporter of Elizabeth Warren??  That doesn't seem like white supremacy
C: (0.733%) T: @steph93065 @ewarren Elizabeth Warren along with the other Democrat losers running for president are trying to start a race war because nothing else has worked and they would rather burn the country down then not get their way #DeportDemocrats

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren strikes me as a good,caring,decent human being, who if elected,will look out for the little people.we had such a person in barack Obama. Let's vote as if our lives depends upon it.
C: (0.984%) T: Trump deserves no more blame for the El Paso shooting than Sanders and Warren deserve for the atrocities committed by people who take their political resentments too far. https://t.co/ToJLNGOgVW

C: (1.000%) T: @mj_lee When Elizabeth Warren says, No profit is worth those lives, my though is it matters how much profit and who your asking. Welcome to trumps America in the year 2019.
C: (1.000%) T: Can everyone please stop acting like Elizabeth Warren is Hillary 2.0? It's fundamentally untrue and honestly sexist as hell.
C: (1.000%) T: @bmeuplondon @chelseahandler Your socialists running for president asking for donations when we had 2 mass shootings and then blaming Trump.  Itâ€™s funny that the one in Dayton was a socialist and was a fan of Socialist and Indian liar Elizabeth Warren who was asking for donations on Twitter.  Disgraceful

C: (1.000%) T: @swaknan @11thHour @FrankFigliuzzi1 Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg edge edge edge have all said they will decriminalize illegal border crossing.   Dems want as many illegals here as possible, because they consider them as "Unregistered Democrats."
