C: (0.982%) T: @EWErickson The “media,” which includes you btw, has been covering this for decades. It was the media that uncovered his plagiarism in 1988 before Elizabeth Warren was a blip on anyone’s radar screen.
C: (1.000%) T: @xNo_one_famousx @francispouliot_ @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren This is a staged Tweet by a propagandist in Warren's campaign..."just happened to come accross Elizabeth Warren???"  These people are so intellectually dishonest, it is their second nature.
C: (1.000%) T: A Joe Biden / Elizabeth Warren ticket would get a huge majority of the Democratic Party’s support and votes in 2020.  But I can understand people who say the Vice President of Biden should be a person of color or younger, to represent a wider variety of people &amp; other generations

C: (0.965%) T: @DailyCaller Elizabeth Warren has become desperate for power.
C: (1.000%) T: @randarchist @nytimes Touché. But I do in fact care very much about policy. I prefer the proposals of Elizabeth Warren and other candidates and think they have a better chance of winning a general election. I'm also not crazy about Bernie Sanders' temperament. He's a red-faced screamer. It gets old.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is running on massive bold changes to America. Why? We are one of the most prosperous nations in 6000 years of history. What kind of fool would jump off a luxury yacht into a socialist dinghy in the middle of the ocean just to try something new?
C: (1.000%) T: Smart ideas! We could do this.  “‘We can do universal background checks, we can ban the weapons of war, but we can also double down on the research and find out what really works,’ Warren said then. ‘We need to treat this like the virus that's... https://t.co/7Vc7crjO6R

C: (1.000%) T: They don't offer plans to stop violence-the parrot years of political cr*p that gets the same no results &amp; @KamalaHarris tweets out bullets on a daily basis... she should shut up https://t.co/cqjOBYVP5T
C: (1.000%) T: Americans are far too stupid to elect someone this qualified to be president. Just as they were more than stupid enough to elevate Traitor Trump &amp; Bush II to president Talking Teaching With Elizabeth Warren, the Most Professorial Candidate Ever https://t.co/hymzDNm2K2 via @thecut
