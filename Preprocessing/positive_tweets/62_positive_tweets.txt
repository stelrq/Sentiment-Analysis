C: (0.988%) T: @thatinterlace Imagine a podcast hosted by four American versions of Aaron Bastani who all think calling Elizabeth Warren "Lisa Simpson" is the height of political satire.

C: (1.000%) T: @SharylAttkisson @FreeStateYank Stop being so nice. Elizabeth Warren slandered Darren Wilson. She needs to be sued.
C: (1.000%) T: Smart ideas! We could do this.  â€œâ€˜We can do universal background checks, we can ban the weapons of war, but we can also double down on the research and find out what really works,â€™ Warren said then. â€˜We need to treat this like the virus that's... https://t.co/7Vc7crjO6R
C: (0.985%) T: @ewarren Dayton shooter Connor Betts described himself as a 'leftist' who hated Trump, wanted Elizabeth Warren for President and was PRO-gun control - his now-suspended social media accounts show what the MSM won't.  https://t.co/esVRvlwJV0
C: (1.000%) T: If Elizabeth Warren ever said anything that prompted the Dayton killer to buy those 100-round magazines and mow down 9 innocent victims in less than a minute, I would call her out. #notthesamething #GOPdeflection
C: (1.000%) T: @NinjaSocialist @TakedownMRAs @jdforward What indicates that he wanted to kill his sister?  He spoke to a female friend saying that his violent fantasies scared him. That doesn't sound like someone who had "hideous beliefs about women." Also, he was an Elizabeth Warren and Omar/Tlaib/AOC/Pressley fan.
C: (0.906%) T: the ball on this lunatic.    This should upset every single American. NOT A PEEP ABOUT THIS FROM CNN OR THE DEMOCRATS.  FYI ELIZABETH WARREN IS CASHING IN ON THE MURDERS IN EL PASO &amp; OHIO SHE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE 2020 CANDIDACY

C: (1.000%) T: @shortalbino Elizabeth Warren is my fave, but our lineup this cycle is incredibly diverse. I think youâ€™ll find someone you can support in the primary. The nominee is getting my vote no matter who it is.

C: (1.000%) T: @Lelethatsmeme @TomiLahren Dumbasses exist everywhere, and Dayton shooter quoted Elizabeth Warren and your point?
C: (1.000%) T: @BIZPACReview " socialist Elizabeth Warren fan"   but yet Pocahontus blames Trump for the Dayton Killer's actions.   He is also pro-Satan and now hopefully he is with his hero in Hell..
C: (1.000%) T: @tommyxtopher Beto is just grandstanding! Whereâ€™s the outrage for Ohio? Oh, thatâ€™s right, that shooter was a Elizabeth warren fan,,

C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN The Dayton shooter liked socialism and Elizabeth Warren. So socialism is white supremacy now? I didn't realise Elizabeth Warren was a racist white supremacist I thought she was Indian. So confusing help me understand!

C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Iâ€™m seriously concerned about your mental health. The shooter in Dayton was a leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren. The shooter in San Antonio is a progressive supported equal income, universal healthcare, climate change, etc. Leftists are constantly calling the POTUS a racist.
C: (0.635%) T: @njcolas i mean yes it'd still cut into their AUM sources, but i don't understand why people assume that elizabeth warren of all people would choose the dumbest imaginable way to implement a tax
C: (0.997%) T: The Dayton gunman espoused left-wing causes and liked Elizabeth Warren, but that's drawn little attention compared to the anti-immigrant El Paso shooter. The slippery slope of the blame game @MarthaMacCallum https://t.co/fjErgQErAY

C: (0.977%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera You mean the Elizabeth Warren supporter was clinging to Trumpâ€™s every word. You often sound like a fool but never more like one than now!!! itâ€™s more obvious each day that you are trying to ingratiate yourself to the left and turned your back on a friend.
