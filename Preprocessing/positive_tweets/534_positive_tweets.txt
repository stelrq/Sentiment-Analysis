C: (1.000%) T: @jason_howerton @MattWalshBlog Which was more planned out but still made you feel really uncomfortable:  Robert Francis and his tire or Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs ‚Äògetting a beer‚Äô video?   Both of these people think they are relatable and smart enough to run America...God help us all!

C: (1.000%) T: @EclecticRadical @BernieSanders @donnaimamTX Yeah I see what you mean. Like the Elizabeth Warren supporter who shot up Dayton, or the Antifa guy who tried to blow up an ICE facility. Or the Muslim who killed multiple gays at Pulse nightclub. Or...
C: (1.000%) T: @foxandfriends watch Elizabeth Warren talk fractions ..well
C: (1.000%) T: @RBReich I happen to believe that the Walton Family earned this money through hard work and exceptional courage.  AOC, Elizabeth Warren and others have the right idea - tax the wealth over $50M (or some arithmetically derived number) so that the distribution in America is more equitable.

C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister Right on, Ryan! I watch &amp; read a variety of political news, so I've given it time for Warren's poll % toüìà&amp; overtake Bernie, but I continue to see widespread discrimination against Elizabeth Warren on MSNBC (NBC), except for a few uncompromising professionals. What do you think?
