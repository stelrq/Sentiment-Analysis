C: (1.000%) T: @philosophrob Forever the billionaires‚Äô and business allies friend, capitalist Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax the super-rich is not structural change‚ÄîIt was tried and failed before. Liz does not tell us ‚Äútax people‚Äôs wealth and they will manage to reduce it or hide it‚Äù https://t.co/X4b4gPazBj

C: (0.998%) T: @DanCrenshawTX @MochaLite What white supremacy? The Dayton shooter was a fan of Socialism, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The shooters at San Bernandino, the Pulse Nightclub and Fort Hood were all Middle Eastern and Muslim. The Virginia Tech shooter was Asian.  White supremacy again???
C: (1.000%) T: This is more people than Elizabeth Warren will have at all of her future campaign rallies combined.  Remember, these people are there for the ‚Äúfair‚Äù... not Elizabeth Warren.   That‚Äôs not a Warren campaign rally, she just happens to be the one currently speaking. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Cbjuiq1Haj
C: (0.575%) T: Buffoons like Joe Walsh are outraged over a Trump retweet yet just yesterday Elizabeth Warren and other you Democrats tweeted out a complete lie about Michael Brown being murdered...where was the outrage you complete frauds
C: (1.000%) T: @kyraoser Not sure if you‚Äôve done one about Elizabeth Warren?
C: (0.964%) T: @SamEllison11 @YancyFaith @CSojourner @realDonaldTrump A Satanist supported Elizabeth Warren. If you support Elizabeth Warren you are a Satanist. A KKK guy also said that he supported Hillary, does that mean all members of the Democratic Party are in the KKK and racist too? Is that your logic? https://t.co/gTIlkuffgs
C: (0.687%) T: Sanders leads Democratic presidential hopefuls in Arizona fundraising  Sanders is also the runaway leader in the number of contributions he‚Äôs received from Arizonans with 2,215, more than twice as many as Elizabeth Warren and 5X as many as Kamala Harris https://t.co/WAI1lSIdUm
C: (1.000%) T: @E9onthenest @DrJasonJohnson @notcapnamerica @Ange_Amene One could argue that Kamala Harris's prosecutorial record is also problematic. (I would disagree with that but I'm just saying that no candidate is above reproach.) Respectfully, Elizabeth Warren is a progressive powerhouse today, and has been for the past 20 years.  Any Dem 2020
C: (0.995%) T: I only have respect for MY president. Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @SharylAttkisson Elizabeth Warren repeating the Big Lie about the killing of Michale Brown in Ferguson Missouri. Hardly surprising since she's lied brazenly about being a Native American!  Why do these Dems have to lie?  No one would vote for them if they didn't!

C: (0.994%) T: @AdamSchiff @srmduke87 Remember when Elizabeth Warren said if you're running to take things away from people get out of the race
C: (1.000%) T: But I guess someone said I called Elizabeth Warren ‚ÄúAndrew Jackson‚Äù today so maybe expecting people to show a modicum of balance in their responses is asking a little much
C: (1.000%) T: After visiting the state fair, Elizabeth Warren is ending her Iowa trip with a house party in Des Moines https://t.co/2QitYuGe12
C: (0.973%) T: This is the best proposal out there right now. If we're not going to ban them then let's at least make it financially onerous to make, sell, and buy these awful killing devices.  https://t.co/2QFUhIqQvo
C: (0.992%) T: Democrats are going to help Trump destroy Biden. That will make Elizabeth Warren the nominee and she will lose in a landslide to Trump. There is your next years. Hope you enjoy it.
C: (1.000%) T: It‚Äôs obvious that if Bloomberg is successful at destroying #2A his next target is #1A - this is the pseudo-aristocracy out #FoundFathers feared &amp; despised and the reason the guillotine was invented #2AShallNotBeInfringed #2ADefenders #DeathToTraitors https://t.co/lGiiVeSdGs
C: (1.000%) T: I think Elizabeth Warren murdered Epstein to cover for Hillary ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ https://t.co/Gtrq4Lhc1u
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. https://t.co/xV0IciK9g0  IMO: I can't believe Faux-a-haunts is still around; much less a presidential nominee. She's lied her entire life &amp; her lies get people killed.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren wants higher taxes &amp; wants to blame gun manufactures for guns the democrats gave to shooters to stage the shooting,the guns that were given to thugs by the democrats to set up to stage shootings just simply because they want to disarm everyone. https://t.co/zuZFuKUb2y
