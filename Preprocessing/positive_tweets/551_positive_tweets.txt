C: (0.999%) T: The yard signs and bumper stickers in Brookline/Brighton would lead one to conclude that Elizabeth Warren is polling at 100% in the primaries. Obviously, I never want to move.

C: (1.000%) T: @MarcusEdelstein My top three (I can’t pick one yet): Andrew Yang, Balernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren–it’ll probably come down to who I think can beat Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: People need to listen and vote accordingly.   I would love to see Julian as VP for Elizabeth Warren. Then run for president in 8 years. But his message is more important than politics. It's just that I want this country to truly change for the better. We need his voice. https://t.co/iHWEl59dPu

C: (1.000%) T: @TrumpStudents @BetoORourke And Elizabeth Warren was just buying lemonade with her cameras rolling, too.  PHONY: not genuine, fraudulent, person or thing.

C: (1.000%) T: @TMC32795932 @DiamondandSilk @ChrisCuomo What?  Trump already called Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas. So he should apologize for those remarks then.
C: (0.715%) T: https://t.co/jYqFRWbIMn  This goes for Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand makes them big racist. https://t.co/jYqFRWbIMn
C: (1.000%) T: (God help us all. What a fucking dick. At least he wasn’t dumb enough to challenge Elizabeth Warren’s Senate seat.) Curt Schilling's reported run for Congress in Arizona gets the Trump approval  https://t.co/cmhaWdb3zB
C: (1.000%) T: @DiamondandSilk @ChrisCuomo Don, Jr. isn’t Italian-American. It’s not a slur to him. To Italian-Americans it is.   Just like it’s a racial slur when Trump calls Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas.   I bet his weak self wouldn’t go up to a black woman and call her Shaniqua. In fact, try it Trump. https://t.co/LIK3jD0HNm
C: (1.000%) T: @ARmastrangelo @realDonaldTrump Please, someone explain to me how a put on feisty little idiot like Elizabeth Warren can get any attention at all. Even among other idiots?   She has about as much business above ground level as a mole.
