C: (0.943%) T: Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren deciding to support abolishing the filibuster means that they functionally support passing more progressive policies than Bernie Sanders does.
C: (0.999%) T: He didn't shoot his sister first.  He shot his trans brother who was living as a female.  Will this twist in the story of the Dayton mass killer make any Fox News talking heads or Republican, including Trump, stop claiming that Elizabeth Warren was an inspiration for his acts? https://t.co/y0c64TMyT0 https://t.co/rIOrGCOXeY
