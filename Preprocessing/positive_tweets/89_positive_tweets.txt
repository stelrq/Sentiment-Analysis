C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a Native American. I said yes.**  **I just figured as long as chief Liz is telling lies I could tell one too and pretend she was actually Native American (she’s not).
C: (1.000%) T: How many other political candidates do you think are contacting Joe Rogan to come on his show now? Out of the presidential candidates that haven't been on yet... Elizabeth Warren possibly Cory Booker. They're the only ones I see as using online activity as a proper step
C: (1.000%) T: @RyanAFournier Probably Elizabeth warren supporters making those threats just like the shooter was a supporter of her. (Antifa)
C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if I support Elizabeth Warren. I said who?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is always angry, always mortified .. by everything, and is in pain. We need a President who can stay calm and is not constantly overwhelmed.  Countries won’t respect a person who believes everything is traumatic .. or that her entire country is racist. #2020
C: (1.000%) T: @AnnCoulter Elizabeth Warren, as does her peers, does not believe the laws of society apply to her.
C: (0.996%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren would be a good president.  I said, HELL NO!!!!!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Wow. If Elizabeth Warren can't tell the truth now, how deceitful would she be as president?
C: (0.996%) T: Hmmm, ppl saying no. What B.S. I would not be happy either, BUT there is no way in hell I would not vote for Trump &amp; end up with a Elizabeth Warren or a Bernie OR ANY Leftist. That is insane. Now I am getting pissed. Smh  #Trump2020 PERIOD. https://t.co/LhP5Sj5iFp
C: (0.793%) T: @KimNorvellDMR If trump is a racist or white watever then for sure elizabeth warren is an indian!!!
C: (0.646%) T: LizDub ain’t wrong, look no farther than his involvement in the #centralparkfive: Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, said in an interview that she believed Donald Trump was a white supremacist. https://t.co/V4yV0FeDHa via ⁦@nytimes⁩
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC I’ve donated to Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris and I’m proud of all of them and am happy for anyone to know it.

C: (0.987%) T: @JoyousPanther @kylegriffin1 She literally had to apologize for saying that she was Native American https://t.co/ffDKVCYZpN
C: (0.770%) T: senator elizabeth warren? more like senator vile warren #RiggedEmmys #filthytrump
C: (1.000%) T: @Alexiadlcruz Don’t tell me Elizabeth Warren wouldn’t shoot a bunch of Trump supporters if given the chance.
C: (1.000%) T: A very confused Joe Biden made a speech condemning White Supremacy while the President visited Dayton, sleepy Joe apparently in the dark, not knowing the shooter was a Democrat socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren.  Wrong group, wrong cause of the shooter.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC @mehdirhasan Shit, I declare almost daily that Elizabeth Warren would be the best President since Barack Obama. You can post me on a list if you want.
C: (1.000%) T: @DailyCaller Yet, not one single democrat blamed Faucohauntus, oops, Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooter who was a fan of hers. But that’s none of my business https://t.co/tp62rnL1Re
C: (0.860%) T: @ThoughtsinMind4 @GeraldoRivera @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump The mayor of Dayton is an idiot, looks at her press conference from earlier when she blamed Trump after knowing the wacko was an Elizabeth Warren leftists nut job. Why should he take blame for the lefts people when they hate him and even say so
C: (1.000%) T: @Sjeuxyis @CoryBooker You obviously didn't read the dipshits manifesto did you..... Blaming trump for El Paso makes as much sense as blaming the shooting in Ohio on Elizabeth Warren...you did know the shooter in Ohio was an huge supporter of Elizabeth Warren right.
C: (0.997%) T: When ALL you have is lies,  right #ElizabethWarren? FACT CHECK: Elizabeth Warren Repeats Charlottesville 'Fine People Hoax' | Breitbart https://t.co/rayoGyqBw1
C: (1.000%) T: She could always identify as an underprivileged person of color in order to feel good about herself. It worked well for Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/MRNNzbONMJ
