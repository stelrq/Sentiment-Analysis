C: (1.000%) T: Twitter famous when Elizabeth Warren 2020 president hopeful stops by a little ole lemonade stand in the middle of America.  &amp; @benshapiro is trolling the reporter from the Des Moines Register for the not so honest wording of her post.

C: (1.000%) T: Also, Elizabeth Warren's plan (what is being discussed here via AOC) proposes a *public option* for internet.  Nothing is stopping you from getting Comcast if you please.  Though, in Chattanooga, most wound up on EPB by choice because it is so much better than privately run ISPs.
