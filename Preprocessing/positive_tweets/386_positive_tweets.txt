C: (1.000%) T: @MattWalshBlog 1.  @NickJFuentes doesn't condone violence of any kind.  So no, the three mass shooters do not have his "exact ideology".  2.  One of the shooters is an Elizabeth Warren supporting ANTIFA Satanist into animes about pederasty.  3.  All three shooters were Betas, not unlike you.

The Dayton murderer used Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs words in his manifesto.  Are Sanders &amp; Warren evil?
