C: (1.000%) T: @lindarchilders @GeraldoRivera @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump He also had a bunch of dem issue talking point point, like climate change...  if something Trump said was responsible for a mass shooting, there would have been more than one (Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter). The one, and only one, responsible is the shooter
C: (1.000%) T: @cj5414 @NeldaFine @Mare39271910 @Pat_Francis @MyRedBeetle @funder @realDonaldTrump Except the latest mass shooter was quoting Elizabeth Warren. She is not President. Cute meme though.

C: (1.000%) T: @lizcourt @PoliticalKathy And every single politician lies. I guess Elizabeth Warren needs to resign? She lied about her heritage for decades.  Prove he's a racist. Be specific.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren So you lied again. How’s that any different from the lies you tell each and every day, Pocahontas?  I asked the president if Elizabeth Warren lies. He answered in a language you would understand, Elizabeth. He said: https://t.co/4EOz4qeoGr

C: (0.995%) T: @kylegriffin1 Gotta love Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @FoxFriendsFirst you don't know what's behind the Dayton shooter who was ANTIFA &amp; a Elizabeth Warren supporter but we know what was behind the El Paso shooter. The problem is your reporting of the Facts.
C: (1.000%) T: @Sekum_ I encourage you to strongly watch and listen to Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris because they will do way more for both you and I than Bernie ever will or has. His resume is pretty lame for how long he's been around and he's the reason we have tRump. Hope you reconsider.
C: (1.000%) T: If you love the fossil fuels that cause climate change, the for-profit healthcare that bankrupts families and billionaires influencing policies and elections, then you will love Elizabeth Warren and her PAC for a Level Playing Field and her Contributors. https://t.co/58Tx7M0Nn4 https://t.co/O9uL7RncWO
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a plan in place to confiscate the guns of law-abiding Americans using the IRS as her tool.  We can't let a Democrat get elected in 2020 if you want the Second Amendment to continue to exist in the Bill of Rights. https://t.co/VFsLDLfkWO
