C: (1.000%) T: @RobertMaguire_ @WendySiegelman These are the folk that corporate democrats want to protect from Elizabeth Warren's 2 or 3% wealth tax which would pay for universal pre k care, eliminate student loan debt etc. I think the % could be doubled and the threshhold lowered and we could fix most of our problems

C: (1.000%) T: @socalmd54 @daveweigel I wonder why Dave Weasel blocked me, so sensitive.
