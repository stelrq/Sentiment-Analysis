C: (1.000%) T: @HoustonMargaret @riotwomennn If Kamala Harris is not the nominee, I would love to see her at Attorney General. If Elizabeth Warren is not, she would be great at Treasury or Commerce.
C: (0.982%) T: @Titanfall1967 @nowthisnews @ewarren Explain all of that in detail.  She screwed over the country?  Elizabeth Warren?  How?  What's her dirty past? ... and don't be racist, or try not to be.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is a better version of Bernie Sanders in every possible way. As long as "having a penis" isn't a criteria you insist on in a leader. There's zero reason to support him over her outside of rank misogyny. Ze-ro.

C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders First bernie tweet I have ever liked. Now he should throw all his energy and support into electing Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has ‚Äúa plan for everything‚Äù. Don‚Äôt get too excited. The last time we had a big plan we lost 1000 seats, as well as the House, Senate and White House in the six years after we passed the ACA.   #SundayThoughts #SundayThoughts  https://t.co/dph1V9ZvqL

C: (0.996%) T: @nowthisnews @ewarren Unlike Trump, Elizabeth Warren knows what she talks about! In 2020, it's time to clean the White House of all its rodents...meaning Trump &amp; his filthy Nazi administration!
C: (1.000%) T: You are right. But it‚Äôs all the democrats running for President that think this way. You definitely need to add them all up. They are trying to see how they can win at all cost. Esp add Elizabeth warren in the mix. https://t.co/tnrwCwyR07
C: (1.000%) T: @timjacobwise We can do *both*. Voters need both moral visions AND policy ideas. (We voters are not a homogeneous group.) Elizabeth Warren is doing both, and doing both better than anyone else.
C: (0.999%) T: @DOJMainJustice I don't support Pete Buttigieg, I'm a staunch Elizabeth Warren supporter so you're barkin up the wrong tree here. I'm calling it as I see it, your problem should be with your own behavior

C: (1.000%) T: @scottsantens @AndrewYang Can you point to a balanced article comparing policy proposals of Elizabeth Warren to those of Andrew Yang? What other candidate has as deeply considered platform on their web site?  Is it possible that who ever gets the nomination can absorb the best ideas of the others?
C: (1.000%) T: @Shooter_Bails @ARmastrangelo @Ilhan @ewarren has a plan.  With how to pay for it.  She's not running on liberal virtues, she's running on plans.  https://t.co/nB82IYJjEP
