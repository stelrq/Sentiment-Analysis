C: (1.000%) T: @FeddiUp @TomiLahren @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump So who is the ring leader responsible for the Dayton shooting? Elizabeth warren?
C: (1.000%) T: From the @POLITICOMag archives: “She can talk to normal people and explain complicated things in a way that’s comprehensible.” https://t.co/GiIne8lbZ3
C: (1.000%) T: This, from @rtraister's excellent @NYMag profile of Elizabeth Warren, is pretty funny. https://t.co/Sgg3CEa2zJ https://t.co/MEzLsFJmV4

C: (0.994%) T: @repjohnlewis MSM isn't talking about the Ohio shooting. You know the one that praised Elizabeth Warren. He was her supporter why is no one talking
C: (1.000%) T: @ScottJenningsKY @DonaldJTrumpJr desperate liberals no surprise hitler blame free thinking different cultures liberals and elizabeth warren in particular also blame free thinking cultures like President Trump and non democrats...while lying about her heritage and claiming hertage &amp; falsifying documents.
C: (1.000%) T: @LibsInAmerica @kimguilfoyle So is it Elizabeth Warren’s base that is responsible for the Dayton attack because the shooter was a fan of hers
C: (1.000%) T: @kimguilfoyle You'd be all for it if Matt Gaetz posted the names and employers of donors to Elizabeth Warren. Delighted, in fact. Save your "principled outrage"—we know it's not either one.
C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano I agree and the DNC is going to try to ram him down our throats just like they tried with Hillary. This is not the time for Biden. We need Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @KonaBill @ewarren @OutnumberedFNC Someone asked me today if Elizabeth Warren faked being Pocahontas -and I said yes.
C: (0.997%) T: Tell them your Native American like Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/iRBpMiyIU8
C: (1.000%) T: @julieandjamey @RemaynAnonymous @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Well then by that logic it didn’t have to be those two. It could have really been anyone since we all had parents or grandparents or great grandparents (and so on) who immigrated here. Except I guess native Americans. So probably not Elizabeth warren. ;)
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Dear Elizabeth Warren.  We've been hearing these exact same words since AL GORE started spouting off regarding global warming.  What's odd, however, is that Manhattan is apparently still not under water and nearly 2 decades have passed.  "The sky is falling" - Democrats

C: (0.991%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren was a complete idiot.  I said yes

C: (1.000%) T: I'm going to buy a white Jeep for my next vehicle and name it Elizabeth Warren, especially since it'll call itself a Cherokee.
C: (0.992%) T: Elizabeth Warren read Health Justice Now
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/8OujsieLpp via @twitchyteam
C: (0.505%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a native American. I said hell no.
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren incited the Ohio shooting and I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: I have not heard one reason to NOT vote for Elizabeth Warren. Like the other gurls aren’t seeing her.
C: (0.997%) T: @ewarren I can play this game too. Elizabeth Warren is a racist, white supremacist, and loves to kick puppies.
C: (0.812%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a white person who lied about her ethnicity to take advantage of minority benefits. I said yes.
