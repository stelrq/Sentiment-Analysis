C: (1.000%) T: @SenSanders How much does Elizabeth Warren get per minute for her speeches at colleges?
C: (1.000%) T: Our elections should be as secure as Fort Knox. But instead, they’re less secure than your Amazon account...  Elizabeth Warren has a plan to fix that.  #Warren2020 #TeamWarren #YesWePlan  https://t.co/0rVIZm4DO3

C: (1.000%) T: "You ridicule me for suggesting I had some Native American Blood &amp; call me Pocahontas ! Apparently you think most of us Americans have Mexican blood &amp; that's why you are taxing us to pay for the Wall !"- things I wish Elizabeth Warren would say
C: (0.988%) T: THE GOP IS SAYING A LOT OF UGLY THINGS ABOUT ELIZABETH WARREN, WE KNOW MRS. WARREN THROUGHOUT HER LIFE HAS WORKED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THIS IS NOTHING SHE JUST STARTED SHE HAS ALWAYS HAD A PLAN, &amp; HER PLAN IS TO PROTECT FUTURE GENERATIONS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT. https://t.co/PDybOCxr3B

C: (0.987%) T: @dcexaminer @ewarren @TomRtweets She should retire. https://t.co/Koie69r8P7
C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Oh my stars. Now she’s playing the racist police officers card. There’s no level of low that Elizabeth Warren will not go. Maybe we should start calling you racist for claiming you are a Native American.
C: (1.000%) T: @hockeygirl_CA @Averagedood1 @SteveFicyk @adammanross That's funny. The algorithm doesn't take into account substantial legislative changes, only the numbers. This is actually a fair way to calculate such effectiveness but still meaningless. You can argue that Elizabeth Warren is actually more effective on substance alone...

C: (1.000%) T: @LeftOfStalin @RexHuppke Except my pointing out that I liked Elizabeth Warren had some fine Sanders supporters enraged and telling me liking her plans shows that I'm pretty much a Republican.   While most are just fine, there's a hardcore subset who are fueled by rage and extremism.
C: (1.000%) T: @NewsGuyGreg @emurray1 @MyNews13 @BN9 You were legit Elizabeth Warren's baby double. Amazing.
C: (0.708%) T: @JoeFreedomLove Elizabeth Warren is to the US the same as May was to Brexit, a complete disaster.
C: (1.000%) T: @ryanjreilly @SharylAttkisson Lack of precision?  Show us how Elizabeth Warren's statement on the Michael Brown incident is factual in any way.

C: (1.000%) T: Sen. @ewarren claims taxes on gun manufacturers magically do two things at once. On the one hand, they will stop gun and ammo sales. On the other, they will massively increase tax revenues from those gun and ammo sales. Both of these things can't be true. https://t.co/62SdQSfYbn

C: (1.000%) T: @america_vest @Mabukon Round 2:  I love how no one is asking Elizabeth Warren to justify the concentration camps on our boarder even though she supports ripping another South American country apart (Venezuela) via the Monroe Doctrine redux, resulting is certainly another huge wage of refugees.  STRANGE
C: (1.000%) T: I think Elizabeth Warren cares just as much. I truly feel that. And it feels good. https://t.co/cqEsmCEDrc
