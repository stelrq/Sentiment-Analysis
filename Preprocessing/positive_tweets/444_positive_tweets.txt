C: (1.000%) T: @LiberalsExposed Did you read the quote? The shooter was NOT Antifa.   But even if he was, THE SHOOTING WASN‚ÄôT POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.   His alleged support for Elizabeth Warren means nothing.   If the shooter was a Trump supporter, I would say the same thing.
C: (0.935%) T: @MsDuhMeanor @DanLinden @realDonaldTrump @GOP Clearly it had a profound effect on Active Shooters. 372 incidents in 2014 under Obama. Where was the outrage then? In Dayton, the shooter was a fan of Socialism. A fan of Elizabeth Warren. So logic says lets blame Trump. üôÑ
C: (1.000%) T: Holy shit @politico and @MarcACaputo. "one of Nevada‚Äôs unique political distinctions: the power of women. It‚Äôs the only state in the nation whose U.S. senators are both women". Uh, @MariaCantwell &amp; @PattyMurray might disagree. Do better. https://t.co/yd4ltH4oQO
C: (1.000%) T: @Acosta @alapresidence You &amp; the Rest of the media is responsible for pushing Division &amp; misinformation. Why all the focus on Texas &amp; none on Ohio? Oh because he was a Socialist Elizabeth Warren &amp; Antifa supporter? Or the Antifa Terrorist Attack on an ICE facility got no coverageü§î
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Now let‚Äôs talk about the real rhetoric...coming from Elizabeth Warren..Bernie Sanders and the Squad! üá∫üá∏
C: (1.000%) T: @SebGorka @SalemMediaGrp What's the matter Twitter you don't want people to know this man supported lessons with Warren who supported Elizabeth Warren he was antifa and he did not support Donald Trump he supported socialism they don't want to talk about that neither this Twitter what a surprise

C: (1.000%) T: @Tiffin36 @ThinkingirlU @kimgoodspeed1 @funder So with your logic Elizabeth Warren should not go to Dayton?ü§î
C: (1.000%) T: So we just gonna ignore the fact that the #daytonshooter was a far left supporting, Elizabeth Warren fan, anti 2nd amendment and big into #AntifaTerrorists ? No? Not gonna mention it at all? Is it because it doesn't support a narrative that everything is Trump's fault? ...Ok...
C: (0.984%) T: @robreiner It‚Äôs amazing how everyone focuses on El Paso and ignores Dayton. Couldn‚Äôt possibly be because he‚Äôs a democrat, Antifa supporter and supporter of Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @scrowder No no no no.... He's a leftist, so it's OK! Just like elizabeth warren pretending to be Native American Indian, while having never been raised around or taught about their culture. If they're on the left they get a free pass by the media &amp; subsequently the rest of America.

C: (0.988%) T: I say,‚ÄùNo‚Äù to Elizabeth Warren. She is a stealth conservative who has learned the ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù of ‚Äúpolitical theatre‚Äù. She is a capitalist and lackey to the military industrial complex. Nominate Liz, and I will stay home or vote 3rd Party, Again. #BernieSanders2020
C: (1.000%) T: @jenjenkra @iggdawg @nycsouthpaw Most criminals have a religious affiliation. The vast majority of killers and terrorists are motivated by racism or religious extremism. White supremacy is the major problem these days. The Dayton shooter didn‚Äôt do this because he liked Elizabeth Warren on Facebook.
C: (1.000%) T: Not that he gives a shit but the logic here is especially bad because if we have to recognize one leftist shooter is caused by Elizabeth Warren, we definitely have to recognize every other white nationalist shooter that specifically cites Trump. https://t.co/Yh8xhjX2h8
C: (1.000%) T: @simardswellness @12News The El Paso guy was apparently set off by the first democratic debate in which everyone said they would give illegal immigrants free everything. The Dayton guy apparently was also set off by Elizabeth Warren and other things.
C: (1.000%) T: My premises that this is a Spirtual battle is clear. You won‚Äôt be able to correct many of these shootings u till you deal with the root cause. #turnyourheartstoGod  | Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/uYYU9eIeFK

C: (1.000%) T: @TeamTrump @JoeBiden Actually, our best hope is Elizabeth Warren. ("Pocahontas" to you).  When you finish pissing yourself, keep in mind she will clean house and do to you what you have been doing to us citizens since 2017. If I were you, I'd have a back-up plan.  BTW, it gets pretty cold in Moscow.

C: (0.987%) T: @TheRealRamo @Jaycensored @AGAGooner @EmmaVigeland @Tim_Canova @TYT @TulsiGabbard The Dayton shooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren.  If he donated to her, it would be insane of me to state that Elizabeth Warren now supports mass shootings.
