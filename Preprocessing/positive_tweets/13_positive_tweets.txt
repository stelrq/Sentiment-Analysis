C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren murdered truth; motive: ambition. https://t.co/TYgk5wPzip
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is  reiterating her desire to eliminate the filibuster to pass gun legislation, citing the fact that a majority of Americans support gun restrictions, and her belief that gun control could pass in the Senate.  https://t.co/u6N61L8psy

C: (1.000%) T: @Chicken_Face1 @AbsolutVaccaNY @PaulLeeTicks @RealCandaceO So because it only happened once(incorrect by the way) you seem to not lend it the weight that your giving other shootings?? So I guess lives only matter to you when they agree with your political views?? BTW Dayton shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter.

C: (0.576%) T: @Dead_Scrypt @KamalaHarris @ewarren Everything she does is staged. But I'm still hoping I win the "Have a beer with Elizabeth Warren" contest. It's worth succumbing to the blatant data mining!

C: (0.683%) T: Are Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren too far left to capture the American centrist electorate? https://t.co/x9XxQXxbVV https://t.co/NdPTcU4V9d
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's gun control plan is very good, well-timed, and will (as a big Sanders fan here) put Bernie in a tight spot to answer.  I'd only add that, given the ambitious nature of the plan, taking away guns from frontline police officers (as in the UK) should be included.
C: (0.984%) T: is kamala the one who won a beer* with elizabeth warren? https://t.co/pqWIzuVFZB
C: (1.000%) T: Just saw an American pol sci prof call Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren "world leaders". You'd think at least pol sci academics would know that the US is not the world. Matlab kitna Murricacentrism karoge bhai?
C: (1.000%) T: “It is up to every Walmart customer who worries about the safety of her children, of her neighbors, of her friends, of people across this country to say, ‘I’ve got choices on where I spend my money,’” Elizabeth Warren said. https://t.co/O5wXROchDz

C: (0.532%) T: Elizabeth Warren is desended from native Americans.  Same village as Cher's family and mine.
C: (1.000%) T: Perhaps this is what America needs right now: “patient and plainspoken, like an elementary-school teacher is expected to be, but also intense and sharp the way a law professor is supposed to be.” https://t.co/v4HrQYICOW
C: (1.000%) T: I dreamt that Elizabeth Warren gave me a pep talk in the woods across the road from my house. I felt so much better about everything. That’s the thing about @ewarren. She’s not talking about what she’s going to do, shes talking about what we’re going to do.
