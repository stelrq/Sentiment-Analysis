C: (1.000%) T: @ArielDumas I honestly believe that Elizabeth Warren has a plan for if you barf in her presence and it is kind, and smart, and leaves you with free health care.
C: (1.000%) T: @timjacobwise Right. How dare Elizabeth Warren, having already provided a healthy meal with all the nutrients we need, have the audacity to also give us dessert!? üôÑ  Would be one thing if she were ignoring the reality of Trump.
