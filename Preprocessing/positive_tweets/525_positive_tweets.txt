C: (1.000%) T: I‚Äôve been practicing my impression of Elizabeth Warren cold-calling small donors all weekend. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs GOOD, per se, but it is EXTREMELY fun to do.

Warren cosponsored these bills?

C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren Demands Walmart Stop Selling Guns...  Aren‚Äôt incidents like the #ElPasoShooting and #DaytonShooting the reason we need guns for self-defense?  Logic is lost on the left.  @TwitchyTeam @Joker_Smiles93  https://t.co/q8kwewKzq4
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister Elizabeth Warren was a registered Republican until she was 45 yrs. old. Her wobbly commitment to no PAC $ (her 'vow' doesn't apply in general election) &amp; her admiration of Reagan, should have all Democratic voters extremely wary of her.
C: (1.000%) T: @WalshFreedom Everyday you sound more like a far left radical. When can we expect you to endorse Elizabeth Warren? #turncoat #liar
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúI got a really big team, and they need some really big plansüìö‚Äù Elizabeth Warren, 2019 https://t.co/5BqkQoOkAZ
C: (1.000%) T: @Lyra3141 @realDonaldTrump Absolutely, I consider Elizabeth Warren far more masculine than Trump in terms of her courage, also feminine in her diplomacy and global thinking - as opposed to tribal. I believe the best leaders exhibit the finest qualities of masculine and feminine.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren can make Trump shit his pants with a tweet. And not even one of the ones where she's directly calling him a white supremacist.  And she's one of the NICE Actual Candidates.
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris So I notice u keep following Elizabeth Warren days later ü§£ü§£. Shame neither of u speak the truth and say logical things like we should punish politicians and media for spreading lies and get facts before terrorizing our own city

C: (1.000%) T: @JohnFromCranber @ewarren Blacks are disproportionately murdered by police whether armed or not. Rarely are cops convicted. That‚Äôs a fact. I don‚Äôt need an incentive to vote. I always do and it won‚Äôt be for Trump. Long live Elizabeth Warren, a truth teller.
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill I boggles the mind to think how many people think Elizabeth Warren is progressive. So many of them rationalize her positions because it makes them feel good about themselves.
C: (1.000%) T: @AATAstronaut @AuthorKimberley Elizabeth Warren and/or Kamala Harris will wipe the debate room floor with Dolt45. His mind is deteriorating, and both women can defend their ideas better than he ever could defend his.
C: (1.000%) T: @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump While Ronna McDaniel and other republicans threaten to destroy the planet because of their paychecks from the Koch‚Äôs and others, 2020 Democrats like Elizabeth Warren have plans to keep auto workers employed while becoming fossil fuel free. https://t.co/GTUriaKYRl

C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Replace Elizabeth Warren with Donald Trump and you‚Äôll start making sense.
C: (1.000%) T: @Mikeonterra @realDonaldTrump Statistically, you are more likely to be killed by a Satan worshiping supporter of Elizabeth Warren (9 killed) than to hear a Trump hater make sense.
