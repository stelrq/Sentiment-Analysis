C: (0.995%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Can you link anything that Elizabeth Warren, or any other dem he may have shown an interest in, said or did to the shooting? Did he quote her in a manifesto? Resign already you demented üí©!

C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Your spell-check replaced Trump with Elizabeth Warren. Might want to fix that.
C: (0.989%) T: @bennyjohnson Oh my god Elizabeth Warren just did a Nazi salute https://t.co/1YhJroITWZ
C: (1.000%) T: @TheWayWithAnoa @iamchampa @ewarren @alejchavez Elizabeth Warren called Maduro of Venezuela a dictator. She also said he's denying humanitarian aid, etc. Those are the same talking points used by John Bolton, Elliot Abrams &amp; Marco Rubio. She ain't it either.
C: (1.000%) T: Lads, I really want Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren to win 2020 us elections.
C: (0.995%) T: @KamalaHarris @ewarren Here is Elizabeth Warren showing us her true colors.
C: (0.995%) T: @HeidiPriebe1 Elizabeth Warren is a Fe / Ti user probably ENFJ. Harris is a Te user and maybe even Te dom.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúWell. If living ‚Äúas you choose‚Äù means living free from the friction of circumstances, the ‚Äúthreat‚Äù is large indeed. It is reality.‚Äù https://t.co/62q9wlKVe5
C: (1.000%) T: By the way, for this time being this is also an Elizabeth Warren stan account. If you don‚Äôt like it, feel free to leave! https://t.co/8SoMZA7e2o
C: (1.000%) T: @LindaForAmerica @Briteeye777 Elizabeth Warren needs to lay off of the peyote.

C: (0.995%) T: @thedemureshark @ewarren (Waves hands Jedi Style) You‚Äôre will vote for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: the democrats biden sanders ocasio cortez and her other 3 little monkies and Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth warren and the rest, are the whole cause of all the hatery going on in our country now their responsible for all this shooting causeing hatery not Donald trump
C: (0.985%) T: @CharlesPPierce To me, Elizabeth Warren is that librarian who turned middle schoolers on to books that get banned in the deep south.
C: (1.000%) T: @larryelder @donlemon Where's all the Hollwierdos crying about gun violence?  Appears they don't care about Black men, women and children killed in Chicago almost on a daily basis!  Where are you Al Sharpton, Beto, Elizabeth Warren!  Sounds of silence!!!
C: (0.954%) T: @Christi62820210 @ContesadeSange @washingtonpost Just a couple days ago Elizabeth Warren fanned racial flames with an insane tweet lie about Michael Brown being murdered because he was black. Democrat leaders are the worst here. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson... etc. I really don‚Äôt think Trump is the problem.
C: (1.000%) T: @shallowbrigade I've always liked Bernie, but I think it's worth noting that Warren has never been shy about making blistering attacks on Trump.   She has other gears besides 'professor'.  https://t.co/BtCJLpdCXV
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren on board with the Brazil plan that ensures those most affected(?) by violence, can‚Äôt afford to defend themselves from violence. https://t.co/hOphp1bapo
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren Please post your ‚Äúcomprehensive gun violence‚Äù plan for ALL America to see or is it just a Talking Point ? ü§î
C: (0.983%) T: Elizabeth Warren, or last one standing. https://t.co/0UDiLPMcca
C: (0.995%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the most professorial presidential candidate in modern history. But does America want to be taught? @rtraister reports https://t.co/LJ9W1EBKpS
C: (1.000%) T: @artsyboy1985 I still like Elizabeth Warren a lot, but her Bernie-like tendency to tie every policy back to screwing the 1% is neither smart nor morally courageous. You can‚Äôt always lead with the head.
C: (0.973%) T: @DawnyDec Actually the Dayton shooter was a liberal Democrat and follower of Elizabeth Warren. The El Paso shooter‚Äôs problems dated back way before Trump was elected. We are all for placing blame where it‚Äôs due but the blame here is far more complex than just one person. Solutions matter.
C: (1.000%) T: @MarkYoungTruth @realDonaldTrump @ewarren ...and his grandkids will ask him who is Elizabeth Warren. We never learned about her in school.
