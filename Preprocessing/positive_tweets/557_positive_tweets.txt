C: (1.000%) T: @Honest_Ee @stonecold2050 Yes, I am sorry, it was in Toledo.  Did you read the attachment I sent you?  It is very clear that the OHIO shooter was a leftist who supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  FACT: Most multiple shooters, and shooters overall, are leftists, who support the Democratic Party
C: (1.000%) T: @LeahLibresco @pegobry @ewarren This piece demonstrates the virtue in teaching but also shows how people like Elizabeth Warren with little to teach make it about promoting themselves and become tumors of a cancer

C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren would sell her own flesh &amp; blood grandmother to get ahead.  She would burn down neighborhoods that are in her path.  She wouldn’t pimp out her children but gladly sacrifice your children for her woke agenda.  She is not to be trusted

C: (1.000%) T: @painter_nancy @RGJordanWords @AshleyRenaud @WajahatAli I would ideally like Elizabeth Warren as the nominee, w/ Beto O’Rourke as the VP. I think Warren, while farther to the left of the average voter, is less polarizing than Bernie Sanders. And O’Rourke would attract those a bit closer to the middle, as well as helping to flip Texas.
C: (0.723%) T: @ewarren Well today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a deranged Democrat, and I said YES.
