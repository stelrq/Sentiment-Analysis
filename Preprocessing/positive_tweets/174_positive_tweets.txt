C: (0.983%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was an Injun.  I said hell yes.   1/1024 of pure Squaw.
C: (1.000%) T: @LizzyHock1963 @tammytabby @ewarren @senatemajldr Elizabeth Warren is a capitalist but wants restraints to protect the disappearing middle class

C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄùShe‚Äôs also an older, white, intellectual woman running in the aftermath of the Hillary Clinton debacle.‚Äù  You mean the debacle where Clinton won 3.5M more votes than her primary opponent and almost 3M more than her general opponent?  https://t.co/WBhY0mcmuH
C: (1.000%) T: Trump is right. Biden isn‚Äôt playing with a full deck. But the DNC isn‚Äôt going to rig it for Biden. They‚Äôre going to rig it for Kamala Harris or maybe Elizabeth Warren after @TulsiGabbard nuked Harris(D) in the debate. https://t.co/Kwvo5Jx7Ti

C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister It upsets me that people label Elizabeth Warren a socialist. I have listened to and looked at her plans. They are really good. Progressive and well thought out. A Warren/Harris ticket sounding good!!!  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #WeThePeopleMarch

C: (1.000%) T: @brithume @SebGorka Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have one thing to offer America:  FEAR driven by their disturbing use of identity politics for political power.  Trump didn‚Äôt make them vile.   He simply exposed it.
C: (0.665%) T: @ewarren This pisses me off. What a liar. I can barely contain myself. Elizabeth Warren is hopeless grasping for anything to make her seem relevant. #MAGA2020 https://t.co/mxd9ywUXaD
C: (0.988%) T: @Mal_A_Clypse @LemieuxLGM I can never longer tell when people are being sarcastic. Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren would both be POTUS with the same Congress &amp; Judiciary.

C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr Listen fuckwad,  YOU of all people should not be trying to slam Elizabeth Warren for not doing anything in the world. You were born with a gold plated spoon in your mouth. You don‚Äôt actually run anything or do anything without daddy‚Äôs input. üñïüèª#DotardJunior

C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol The GOP deserves every bit of Elizabeth Warren they will get, God willing and the creek don't rise.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúWhat ‚Äònational conservatives‚Äô propose is government fine-tuning the economy‚Äôs composition and making sure resources are ‚Äúwell‚Äù distributed, as the government (i.e., the political class) decides, forever.‚Äù https://t.co/0HxGco9ZCG
