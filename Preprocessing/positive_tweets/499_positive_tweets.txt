C: (1.000%) T: @CharlesPPierce If the idea of Warren-as-teacher interests you, this insightful (long) article is definitely worth your time: https://t.co/WokiMIObyZ. Her skill and thoughtfulness as a teacher is instructive to all us teachers...and not only teachers.

C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether or not Elizabeth Warren faked being a Native American for the benefits. I said yes.
C: (0.593%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren &amp; Co harts have set Americans back 50 yrs on irradiating racism she is a pathetic lied. Brown had powder burns on his hand from trying to grab an officer‚Äôs firearm from the holster it fired in the struggle

C: (1.000%) T: @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The real question is why are GOP donors so ashamed of their donations? I donated to HRC, Stacey Abrams, Doug Jones, Beto, Elizabeth Warren. Feel free to share. I‚Äôm not ashamed.
C: (1.000%) T: @briknucks I think he would make a great president but so would Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren , the dem party needs to calculate which of those 3 stands the best chance of wining and politely ask the others to step down and concentrate on beating the GOP in other ways.
C: (0.976%) T: @WajahatAli If you like Elizabeth Warren, you‚Äôll love Bernie Sanders. What‚Äôs assume that Bernie came in second, Hillary missed the opportunity of uniting the party by having him as her vice president.We should not miss that opportunity again.
C: (1.000%) T: @WalshFreedom Who are you going to vote for you can either vote for President Trump or you can vote for Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden? You got to be kidding me. 3rd party candidate elect Democrat socialist.  Answer the question #Trump2020
C: (0.987%) T: @ABC Any person who supports Elizabeth Warren for president and is a member of antifa is an obvious sociopath.
C: (1.000%) T: @DesireeCPO30 @VincentJuarez69 @jeffsguardian And there's no way I'll let Bernie be sabotaged by the likes of Elizabeth Warren.  You shouldn't, either.  And no, you're not "calm".  You've been hysterical and irrational throughout these tweets.  Real neoliberal BS on your part.  CHILL.
C: (1.000%) T: @TwcArthur Top of my list now is Elizabeth Warren. Her energy, preparedness, courage, and her ability to explain complicated issues and policies in a way that I can understand. I have watched her in committees and her no BS approach to asking questions to get right at the heart of subject.

C: (0.993%) T: Assault weapons should be banned.  But Elizabeth Warren says all guns and ammunition should be taxed.  It makes sense-they tax cigarettes and alcohol.  Money to go for mental health, victims of gun violence and improve schools. https://t.co/JgBAR9uGFF

C: (0.700%) T: @seanhannity So, racist. AOC is attacking whites again....no surprise.  How about attacking the crazy left wing, dem supporting, Elizabeth Warren, Antifa  supporter who shot up Ohio?  How about just CALLING HIM OUT OR CONDEMNING HIS ACTIONS?
