C: (1.000%) T: @ClemSkelton @TimMurtaugh @kayleighmcenany About as big of a problem as it is for a man quoting AOC while he tried to blow people up. Bottom line: Neither Bernie Sanders, AOC, Elizabeth Warren, nor Donald Trump are responsible for the acts of monsters.
C: (1.000%) T: I feel bad for the grieving families in Dayton Ohio. They will get no attention because the shooter supported Elizabeth Warren and Antifa. Sad...
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Huh? You have been watching too much CNN. Dayton shooter was self described "Leftist" following Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders!  Nice try though you race inciting Pig!
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Actually, the Dayton shooter was a leftist supporter of Elizabeth Warren and the El Paso shooter says the Democrats promise of free health care to illegal immigrants sparkef his rampage. #StopTheHate
C: (1.000%) T: Should we blame Trump for El Paso shootings ? Should we blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton shootings ? Should we blame Bernie Sanders for Congressional baseball shootings ? Which one do you think was covered the most by liberal news ? 52 Shot in Chicago this weekend, Crickets !!
C: (0.988%) T: @SenWarren https://t.co/Rf3Jlva8LS OF COURSE THE SHOOTER WAS A RADICAL LIBERAL WHO SUPPORTED WARREN! HATE &amp; VIOLENCE IS WHAT THE NEW DEMENTED DEM PARTY STANDS FOR &amp; ENCOURAGES WITH THEIR OWN STREET THUGS-ANTIFA!! RETWEET!!
C: (0.995%) T: @no_silenced The kid in Ohio is a Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (0.986%) T: Democrats believe Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren could beat Donald Trump in 2020 https://t.co/LSK0wpRagX /roflmao No one believes this.  Bernie beats Trump? In what universe?  #Trump2020 #MAGA #KAG
C: (1.000%) T: @melaka_redux @Deoliver47 @Shaker_aphra @KamalaHarris I keep asking the Harris campaign about this, with no response. I mean, when Elizabeth Warren, she of the history of anti-native words and actions, is willing to engage but Harris is radio silence? It makes me wonder if I've misjudged them both. Native voices matter.
C: (1.000%) T: @cynthia_spinney So Elizabeth Warren was responsible for the Dayton shooter and Bernie Sanders for the baseball field shooter,  since those shooters were their supporters. Got it. I disagree. But if you say so.
C: (0.978%) T: @UrBetsyJean @ewarren Elizabeth Warren pulled back the curtain on herself. No freedom of speech in her utopia. Just Provda Channal 1, Provda Channel 2, NPR, 1, 2, etc. https://t.co/YnJtaCYkEZ
C: (1.000%) T: @haileegreene12 @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren I know these girls and itâ€™s 1.00 per cup.  Elizabeth Warren likely bought for her staff that I personally saw were traveling with her.  The girls were very excited she stopped.

C: (1.000%) T: 1/ Analysis | Elizabeth Warren is surging. This one big question looms over her.  https://t.co/OmpYTuEBtp  // Any political scientist, pundit, commentator, or political strategist says that they know what "electability" even means is pulling your leg. They don't even have a

C: (1.000%) T: @ChuckCallesto By the looks of the manifesto and the information given on both shooters they were more like liberal Democrats than any Republican I ever heard of. They quoted AOC Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren not trump.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist - news - https://t.co/kVW3igYuSK https://t.co/ZihIDpgrgc   ...and she was SURE she was an Indian...we know how that turned out...
C: (1.000%) T: I slap around one Elizabeth Warren supporter and get 100+ likes in less than an hour.  I spread the good word about Bitcoin and ðŸ¦—ðŸŽ¶  Wake up. These people don't matter.
C: (0.964%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Covering Elizabeth Warren is not a sudden "just happened to come across ". This is an unwarranted fake news sometimes used as "sources"
C: (0.719%) T: Elizabeth Warren doubles down on calling Trump a white supremacist, joining former Rep. Beto O'Rourke:  https://t.co/KzkhZHgFjz https://t.co/1v55plEyDO
C: (0.998%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions Show me where Elizabeth Warren is encouraging violence or even has a tacit approval of it - like trump does.  This is a horrible take and @PostOpinions shouldn't be encouraging this.
C: (0.995%) T: @ewarren Whenever anyone asks me what my plans are I say "I have a plan for Elizabeth Warren to have a plan!" ðŸ˜‚  #Warren2020
C: (1.000%) T: And Elizabeth Warren just happened to go for a looonggg stroll from DC and "happened" upon a refreshment stand. https://t.co/adA0uisOfu
C: (1.000%) T: @scontorno Smart idea, considering those Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s supporters may show up to your town with guns.
C: (1.000%) T: @classypatron Having recently moved from MA I can tell you not even her home state supports her in her WH bid. https://t.co/17oj6z4hes
