C: (1.000%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress No, we're trying to remember the one in Dayton that supported Elizabeth Warren. What Castro did is putting these donors in direct harm from crazies. DEMS are fundraising off of tragedies as usual.
C: (0.987%) T: @WayneDupreeShow Uhhh the shooter was ANTIFA and supported Elizabeth Warren NOT Trump.

C: (0.998%) T: @britknee_00 @joshscampbell @ChrisCuomo Did you know the Dayton shooter hated Trump and supported Bernie and Elizabeth Warren? Had nothing to do with color.
C: (1.000%) T: @BilldeBlasio @realDonaldTrump 'White supremacist' is a liberal talking point. There's as much white supremacy in this country as Elizabeth Warren is native american
C: (1.000%) T: @surfersnout @KamalaHarris If the leftist ideology had merit or was proven, police or the FBI would acknowledge but they have find no proof in what has been put out there by right wing conspiracy theorist. No proof he was in Antifa or a Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis So Dayton can be clearly laid at the feet of Elizabeth Warren the Antifa movement?
C: (0.985%) T: ‚Äú43% of Democratic primary voters said Harris performed ‚Äòexcellent‚Äô at the June debates, compared to just 20% who said the same about last week‚Äôs Detroit debates.‚Äù - @sinclatg. Read more here: https://t.co/eEc3buKGYY
C: (1.000%) T: @LizCooperABC15 @wpdeabc15 Beto plans on crashing the meeting and speaking Spanish to them before Sparticus takes the stage!  I bet Elizabeth Warren is So Jelly right now! #WalkAway #Resist #FBR #BlueWave
C: (1.000%) T: @Dan37601714 @Road_trippn @realDonaldTrump @sundarpichai Okay, here you go. If you really want to learn deductive reasoning I'm going to need you to find an Elizabeth Warren quote where she encourages violence. https://t.co/3g2G7NCVbb
C: (1.000%) T: @GreenleeGazette @ThomasMazze @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @SenWarren Bernie Sanders is an independent, not any kind of Democrat. Elizabeth Warren says "You didn't build that" "Government keep roving bands of Marauders away" you owe all your success to the Government. THAT'S SOCIALISM!
C: (1.000%) T: Hey George, WTF dude? Do you and your Federalist pals and your friends at The Council for National Policy ever say to yourselves, "OMG...WTF have WE done to our great nation?"  #ReallyStupidWatergate  #MoscowMitchMassacre @GOP @GOPChairwoman @gtconway3d  https://t.co/WggG1GuODM
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren we have gun laws that are not being enforced by Congress or the fbi. We don't  need anymore. The NRA is not the problem. Enforce our existing laws. Lawful people have the right to keep and bare arms. Start doing your job. https://t.co/RnWHhqqoPe
C: (1.000%) T: There are so many ridiculously good-looking guys here and they‚Äôre all smart and do outdoor sports and are voting for Elizabeth Warren and, friends, I‚Äôm really starting to worry about my blood pressure
C: (1.000%) T: @dbongino Hey Dan,I just accidentally looked at Elizabeth Warren's https://t.co/Mtjtzc6HFn you realize she has NO tweets over 4,000 just had to say.Shes almost no I can't say that,As crazy as Ole BernieüòÄ
C: (0.996%) T: 2. I‚Äôve even heard ‚Äòhe might have well been the one who pulled the trigger in El Paso.‚Äô Of course no mention of the Dayton shooter being Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs fault. But seriously, after all that - treason, obstruction, racism, murder - where do they go?
C: (1.000%) T: As an educator I really appreciate this article!  https://t.co/4OhttYoy4J
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps Hell, ya lookin‚Äô like Elizabeth Warren is a compliment!  üòÇWomen past their ‚ÄòFuck-it 40‚Äôs‚Äô don‚Äôt give a DAMN about what random sexist jerks think about them anymore  They have too much fun GOING, DOING + SAYING what they want  THEY GET SHIT DONE  #ShePersisted #SheHasAPlanForThat https://t.co/D4eRBOIIBn

C: (0.875%) T: @Cobby100 @hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @POTUS That's categorically untrue. Check Elizabeth Warren, Beto, Kamala, the Mayor. They got plenty of policies and we know that Trump's policies have been erratic and somewhat innefective even as he plays footsie with NK
C: (1.000%) T: could possibly be ‚Äúas close to the perfect candidate‚Äù if she‚Äôd swing a little away from that far left mark https://t.co/rAXRXclVPG
C: (0.987%) T: This just reminds me that Elizabeth Warren wasn't a Democrat until she was 47. That's when she  switched her registation from Republican to Democrat.  Like Bernie, she is an opportunist. Belonging to a party is all about advancing herself. https://t.co/VBmq94i1xk
C: (1.000%) T: @Breaking911 The account retweeted messages supporting Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as posts against ICE agents, including one that said, "these people are monsters," and multiple posts condemning police, and supporting Antifa protesters, who often use violent tactics.
C: (1.000%) T: Well, @CharlesPPierce is onto something here! üòÑ  "But the thing that's sold Elizabeth Warren to Iowa is primarily Elizabeth Warren. None of the candidates seems to be having as much fun as she is."  #warren2020 #TeamWarren  Great read! üëá  https://t.co/XCYNb8iUud
