C: (1.000%) T: #Tucker Elizabeth Warren has actually been able to trace her family back to the ancient Han dynasty. In this Face Book post she shows her reverence for traditonal Chinese dress and smoking ritual. https://t.co/U5Lop72SAO

C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker Hey ass wagon..the Dayton Ohio shooter was a libtard supporting Elizabeth Warren as you know but you won't mention that!
C: (1.000%) T: @kate_sheridan @JohnCornyn @allahpundit Kate, I hope youâ€™re as eager to fight the war as you are in starting it.  So, since the Dayton shooter was an avid gun control guy and ardent Elizabeth Warren Supporter we should publicize the names of all her donors in and around Ohio, you know just in case someone wants to act
C: (0.988%) T: Stop scapegoating â€” Trump didn't cause El Paso any more than Elizabeth Warren caused Dayton. Yeah but Democraps will never agree!  https://t.co/pPVNfbEFz2
C: (1.000%) T: @BillRight20 @TomiLahren You don't need a manifesto to find someones motivation.  We still know nothing about why the Vegas shooter went on his rampage.  We yet to have anything on Dayton.  Just being an Elizabeth Warren fan is not a reason to shoot up a bar.

Oh wait - that was trump referring to Hispanics ðŸ˜´
C: (0.984%) T: @hillscott39 @ewarren You should be scared. Idiots with guns roam the streets in this country killing people indiscriminately. Elizabeth Warren plans to do something about it, so people aren't scared when they send their kids to school that they might not see them at the end of the day.
C: (1.000%) T: @jimsciutto No off to Dayton to get the latest on the Elizabeth Warren supporter Shooter??????
C: (1.000%) T: Seven times this year, a gunman has opened fire in a U.S. public place, killing at least three people. One shooter is suspected of being a white supremacist. One was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. And two were black. https://t.co/sNS7nrXzmQ
C: (1.000%) T: Another Elizabeth Warren supporter acting like a terrorist https://t.co/xFxq13hggt
C: (1.000%) T: @whateversusan Really loving the "he retweeted leftists therefore Elizabeth Warren caused his brain rot" bad-faith takes from the right
C: (1.000%) T: watch how James Glenday waffles the anti #trump narrative from El Passo....but no mention of the Mass Shooter #daytona  a Democrat supporter of Elizabeth Warren. #ABCBIAS  #theirABC MSM only tell you want THEY want you to hear. #auspol #maga https://t.co/XovcsWz9Yo
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC Every speech you make, every interview you do, every tweet you make. You, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, Kamala Harris, all of you, you always have the word hate or racism in everything you say. You people preach hate and racism!
C: (1.000%) T: @atlsportscholar @UrbanWeirdo @NomeDaBarbarian @daveweigel @nycsouthpaw @KristenOrthman No the real question you should be asking is did Elizabeth Warren radaclize him?   https://t.co/AMybYOm1hk
C: (1.000%) T: @Jeffsmith5084 @Rona61 @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl It carries more weight when they contribute to white supremacy, if  people want to know I gave a nice person like Elizabeth Warren money, who cares?
C: (0.619%) T: @GSwarthout @ScottFantasy @AOC @ewarren Supported gun control Elizabeth Warren antifa sounds like alefty to me
C: (1.000%) T: Any business or person that donates to Elizabeth Warren is complicit and endorses the savage killing of nine innocent people in Dayton, OH and the appropriation of Native American culture for the benefit of over-privileged whites to falsely get minority scholarships. Newsworthy. https://t.co/hgzW0mVIYG
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan boy.
C: (1.000%) T: @LindaRobertso @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl You do know the shooter in Ohio was a liberal and Elizabeth Warren supporter, right?
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Does Elizabeth Warren listen to the same president I listen to?  I think by all these people throwing the racist word around are race baiting the country, everything that's going to happen in the future will be because of them race baiting.
C: (1.000%) T: @ScottChalleen @RealCandaceO @AOC @BetoORourke Actually the Dayton shooter was an avowed Socialist and Elizabeth Warren supporter. Also was a  Satanist. Maybe they go hand in hand ðŸ¤”
