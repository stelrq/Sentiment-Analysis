C: (0.519%) T: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders call for Walmart to stop selling guns, as... #Topbuzz https://t.co/UZG0L7VLHf
C: (1.000%) T: @NateSilver538 Biden is toast and so are the corrupt "party elites"! Elizabeth Warren is going to eat his lunch and then take his bus fare home. Don't know why you've been such a defender of his favored status.
C: (0.990%) T: @PeteButtigieg Agree with Buttigieg. Dayton shooter was Elizabeth Warren supporter. Warren is directly responsible for this shooting and must be held accountable.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is ready to teach America: https://t.co/ldAPtuoLDb  Via @TheCut https://t.co/61Tds08yBW
C: (1.000%) T: @samusisawesome @FDRLST So what about the Dayton shooter? He was apparently a big Elizabeth Warren fan so I'd say we also have a white progressive problem.

C: (1.000%) T: I believe that Elizabeth Warren is going to win the Iowa Caucus in February. Yes, I will be retweeting this on caucus night if and when it happens.
C: (1.000%) T: Warren Attempts To Court Rural Voters With Broadband Proposal What she didnâ€™t say, is the $85 billion will come out of their pockets, as well as the millions of other Americans that pay taxes. Her plans seem great, until it comes to paying for them. https://t.co/HYFfwjTP5U

C: (1.000%) T: @RidgewayGirl01 @thatprincesong @marcushjohnson I would wholeheartedly vote for Elizabeth Warren, but I just don't think she'd beat Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: @AmrainSophie @sandtats @EmmaKinery @DCinMI59 He polls even better with the corrupt rich.   Number of billionaire donors by candidate:   Pete Buttigieg: 23 Cory Booker: 18 Kamala Harris: 17 Michael Bennett: 15 Joe Biden: 13 John Hickenlooper: 11 Beto Oâ€™Rourke: 9 Elizabeth Warren: 2 Tulsi Gabbard: 1 Bernie Sanders: 0
C: (0.989%) T: @marcushjohnson Her plan isn't that protectionist, it's more pragmatic.   Have a read of this piece by @rodrikdani:  https://t.co/UbQUTetEDR
C: (1.000%) T: Can Americans handle a teacher as president? @rtraister reports on Elizabeth Warren's career as an educator and how it informs her approach to politics https://t.co/sbjWgNcIc4
C: (1.000%) T: Based on my direct voter contact in Northern Iowa during the last 24 hours, there are just four candidates in 2020: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren.  Thatâ€™s it. No voter mentioned any other candidate by name.
C: (0.979%) T: @KamalaHarris Trump had nothing to do with these shooters. They were all registered Democrats. The Dayton shooter was an ANTIFA and Warren supporter. Elizabeth Warren is directly responsible for these shootings. Warren should be charged as an accomplish to shootings.
C: (1.000%) T: @RowanKaiser @N7IRL Same reason Elizabeth Warren took that stupid DNA test. An attempt to appease bad faith criticisms that they should know in advance wonâ€™t work because they are obviously in bad faith.
C: (1.000%) T: @SharylAttkisson @PoliticlyJaded Sharyl, anyone who would like to get into a major university by claiming Native American heritage can lie easily.  And Elizabeth Warren fits that category.  Sheâ€™s an extreme liberal and she will do anything to get ahead in the nomination process.

C: (1.000%) T: @KatCoken123 @bfraser747 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @Cowboy25259 @DonnaWR8 @petluvers4Trump @HDowning113 The ladies are looking pretty good. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris  Iâ€™m undecided somebody not just to beat Trump. But somebody to fix everyday and world problems
C: (0.988%) T: @albertojruiz @peteroliphant2 @politico The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan and had contact with ANTIFA. I donâ€™t blame Warren, like I did not blame Sanders for the shooter who supported him that shot up the republicans practicing baseball. I BLAME the shooters and the shooters alone.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren introduces ambitious plan to reduce gun-deaths by 80% https://t.co/9WJJfSb95g
C: (1.000%) T: @michelleinbklyn Now do Elizabeth Warren. Like when she said the 2016 election was rigged for Hillary Clinton. Ask to explain herself, or is everything she does a pass because she's a woman? Ask her about her Native American status she listed on her entrance exam. ðŸ™„
