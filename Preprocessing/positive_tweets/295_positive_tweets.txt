C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps I bet Elizabeth Warren has a plan for how to deal with jerks like that.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Do you really believe that Elizabeth Warren lies more than Donald Trump? Trump is such a sociopath, he doesnâ€™t know right from wrong.
C: (0.994%) T: @LizMair You are so wrong....only grifters do not want Elizabeth Warren. We are on to you.
C: (0.725%) T: Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren calls police murdering racists on Twitter https://t.co/Z0W4dIGpcq via @The Peoples Ledger
C: (1.000%) T: @668GuerrillaMan @musgrove74 @HouseDemocrats Yeah, Elizabeth Warren says he should be impeached but don't vote for her because someone else she has no control over won't. Real intelligent choice there. I'm done arguing with people who will help Trump get reelected but claim not to support him.
C: (0.986%) T: @BusyPhilipps Elizabeth Warren is absolutely KILLING it!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @buckygoldymom @ewarren You better not be calling me a Trump wannabe. If so, you are massively confused. Elizabeth Warren is a Bernie Sanders chameleon. Look at her history. Clintonite, Reaganite... no thanks to both. Lip service is all she offers. No history of any major reform. #CantTrustThis

C: (0.989%) T: @AmziQureshi @AnnieLeineweber @chicopeitz @BillKristol I deserve Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Ban treasonous Communists like you.  #DaytonShooter inspired by Communist Democrat Party member Elizabeth Warren. (@ewarren)  Lunatic El Paso shooter inspired by the The Communist Democrat debate.  @TheDemocrats are the party of hate. https://t.co/1OKsDxBJ73
C: (1.000%) T: @w_terrence OMG!  Well, letâ€™s all give back all the donations we have gotten.  Poor Elizabeth Warren said she has no big donors, let her show us.  Just like she is an American Indian, I believe that!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren proposes 'public option for broadband' https://t.co/BOfU3Pahoa https://t.co/1i2WIJHGbB
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidAFrench Elizabeth Warren donors aren't ashamed. Gillibrand voters aren't hiding. Harris' voters can't be doxxed. We are proud to stand with America, against fascism. https://t.co/iQRE0CZ86c
C: (1.000%) T: @Talkmaster @RoArquette @allahpundit No worries, all she has to do is self-identify as something else like Elizabeth Warren and that other batshit crazy lady that said she was black.
C: (0.995%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI You mean like the Dayton shooter who had Elizabeth Warren stuff plastered all over his twitter?  Sit down.
C: (0.985%) T: @phishinthegorge @PpollingNumbers @surveyusa Elizabeth warren doesn't suppprt M4A and is a War mongerer
C: (1.000%) T: This is such a good profile of Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/1YD713foXO
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner After the mass slaughter in Ohio in the name of Elizabeth Warren, the squad continues to incite violence with it's refusal to end their racist campaign. The House democrats have no soul. We are staring into the face of evil.  Oh, look Rob Meathead Reiner!  I can do it, too!
C: (1.000%) T: @JCGilly1 @QuillArrow @GoBeachie @GA10Indivisible @repjohnlewis I like Elizabeth Warren the best right now. She has a record of fighting corruption and has come up with some amazing plans that could transform our government to make America the democracy it should be. As for media I do my own research on subjects and look for the facts.
C: (0.742%) T: @realDonaldTrump Trump today has attacked: Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley "Sleepy Joe Biden" Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Shepard Smith "Fake News CNN" "The Failing New York Times" "The Lamestream Media" But he's trying to unify the country.?
C: (0.501%) T: @K1erry @tribelaw @1EastwoodingAve By the way, I'm guessing he hasn't seen Elizabeth Warren using this as a fundraising event ðŸ¤”
C: (0.988%) T: @dahdae12 @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump @GOPLeader @DevinNunes @JaySekulow I sent that video to the FBI and one that shows her with Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @ericbradner @samstein People are people. Beto gets it. I think Mayor Pete gets it, too.  Elizabeth Warren gets it. Weâ€™re lucky to have these figures running to become leader of the free world.
C: (1.000%) T: @AzaelFl97342603 @brndnbrtls @MarioLopezExtra @_the_AR Pointless explaining the difference between legal and illegal. He calls America stolen land and is an Elizabeth Warren supporter. He can't understand logic or irony. https://t.co/A9mXgBpMQo
C: (0.996%) T: @DesigningHector @jlmannisto @WingsScotland @jessesingal that's not evidence ("everything she has ever said, I am very smart!")   Warren rejects the socialist label and has said she is a "capitalist to my bones" Bernie is the only candidate who uses the label socialist https://t.co/S9h5zhCu8F
