C: (1.000%) T: The emergence of Sen. Elizabeth Warren as something other than the candidate of policy wonks. Her strong debate performances &amp; a knack for organizing give her the clear path to the Dem. nomination.  Surging in Polls, Warren Has Clear Path to the Nomination https://t.co/a5tub8VUE3
C: (1.000%) T: @homerjarvis11 @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren @DMRegister Elizabeth Warren is a liar who said she wouldn't accept monies from big donors but recently accepted monies from big donors including donors from Muslim countries. Couple this with lying that she is Native American to obtain benefits allotted to REAL minoritIes. @SenWarren
C: (1.000%) T: Yesterday I no joke saw a tweet from a Democrat saying yes Elizabeth Warren does bear responsibility for the Dayton shootings because she‚Äôs hitched herself to the Bernie platform and Bernie‚Äôs supporters are misogynists
C: (1.000%) T: @chuerta1 @JoeBiden @BarackObama I'll vote for Biden (begrudingly) even after a statement like this because anyone is better than the thing currently in the White House. HOWEVER, I personally prefer someone who isn't  an establishment candidate. The only candidate I like at the moment is Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @BetteMidler And what about Elizabeth Warren inciting the Dayton shooter? Oh yeah, that doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative
C: (0.962%) T: Elizabeth Warren is lying.   Michael Brown stole from a local convenience store, strong-armed the owner, then attempted to take a police officer's weapon.   That police officer received due process.  Police officers have been under attack because of lies pushed socialists. https://t.co/zZSVfXlxww
C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 Since the Dayton OH shooter (who was a fan of Antifa and a satanist) supported Elizabeth Warren, is Warren responsible for the dead by his hand? By your ‚Äúlogic‚Äù the answer is yes. You know that you TDS people are sick in the head, don‚Äôt you?
C: (1.000%) T: Well I guess you don‚Äôt know @ewarren family history of how they treated Native Americans your ancestors are ashamed @Deb4CongressNM https://t.co/cvAKQsbJN8 https://t.co/FMpC6UhyUj
