C: (1.000%) T: @ScottFordTVGuy Whenever I see Elizabeth Warren I think of the American Indians who did not get the opportunities and money she did. By lying about Indian identity. Did she ever find them and make reparations since she says it was all a mistake? Isn't that's what you do when you make a mistake?

C: (0.987%) T: @BretBaier why aren't you guys mentioning Dayton Ohio where the guy supported a gressive Elizabeth Warren and was a socialist
C: (1.000%) T: @h3h3productions These are Ill minds that need help, how is this Trumps fault?

C: (1.000%) T: Pennsylvania has been moving away from Trump virtually from the moment that he won the state in 2016. Joe Biden is highly regarded in PA, but Elizabeth Warren would also give Trump a fight in the state. Michigan &amp; Wisconsin may already be lost for Trump. https://t.co/TjuJmokiT3

C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Lol!! It's funny because Charlie Kirk has always been full of shit but he's just getting worse and worse! The next will be a video of Elizabeth Warren breathing really hard in someones direction.  This guy has built a career by failing hard!
C: (1.000%) T: Warren is so out of touch she doesn't know (or maybe she doesn't care) that Walmart doesn't sell the type guns used in these mass shootings. So, her stance, therefore, serves as proof if elected President, she will be coming after all guns. Voters... https://t.co/3vAltiVSH5
