C: (1.000%) T: @JoshuaHol So you're completely misrepresenting the origin of Elizabeth Warren's plan for... clicks?  So you're one of those media folks who learned not a solitary thing from how y'all covered the 2016 election like it was some meaningless reality show?

C: (1.000%) T: @Ruckus1974 @AOC Recent mass shootings were shamefully, by the dems, made into a political spectacle. They blamed white supremacists!

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren I am completely offended by your false statement. That white officer is Darren Wilson. He was cleared after being investigated by every known source available. This officer lost his career for doing his job. I see you have a hard time with the truth Pocahontas.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs @ewarren gun violence proposal should help us in Nevada. Many gun folks will yell it goes to far, but it really doesn‚Äôt. Many gun control people like me will think it doesn‚Äôt go far enough. So in truth it is probably just right. @TeamWarren @NVforWarren
