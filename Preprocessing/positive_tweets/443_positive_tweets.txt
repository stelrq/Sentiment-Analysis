C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Your bot CC just made a racist comment about Elizabeth Warren. Your whole administration is riddles with racism &amp; white supremacy. #FailedPresident #RacistGOP #TrumpsTerrorists #MassacreMitch
C: (0.805%) T: @WellsFargo if Elizabeth Warren is elected president of the United States her first order of business would be 2 shut down @WellsFargo and they know it! @WellsFargo it's not worried now but could be very soon along with what I have too expose to regulators and the people! End it!
C: (1.000%) T: @Hogan80Hogan @BetoORourke Has ‚ÄúMaster Beto‚Äù made any reparation payments yet ? Is everyone forgetting that the Dayton shooter was an avowed socialist Elizabeth Warren supporter ? Likewise remember the Bernie bro that wanted to assassinate Republicans?
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump You do realize the one from Dayton, Ohio supported Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sandies and Antifa...... it‚Äôs the hatred coming from the Left...
C: (1.000%) T: @rudepundit Elizabeth Warren in this cycle, but Bernie AND Hillary in the past. My money = my values. If you're not comfortable with anyone knowing where your money is going, maybe you should look at your values, too. #tweetyourdonations
C: (1.000%) T: @NBCNews He also supported Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. It Took NBC 4 days to post this I‚Äôm not surprised because it doesn‚Äôt fit NBC narrative.
C: (0.984%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA did not encourage that crazy bastard to plot to sexually assault girls who rejected him when he was a high school student, nor did they influence him to kill nine innocent people.
C: (0.668%) T: Don't worry...Momma Warren will take care of all farmers!  https://t.co/710i5YYsuJ
C: (0.977%) T: This is a reminder that the #Dayton shooter was a PROVEN #AntiFa supporter who liked Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  The shootings are not the the President‚Äôs fault, and they aren‚Äôt Warren or Bernies‚Äô faults.  They‚Äôre only the fault of one.  #GunControl #TrumpEulogies https://t.co/l4VrtnrnHs
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN At least people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are trying to do something about it, whereas you read a script off a teleprompter pretending to give a shit, say the wrong city name, and then sit on your ass doing nothing.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC I myself am proud of the candidates I have monetarily supported.   HRC, Elizabeth Warren &amp; Amy Klobuchar.  I will also support the eventual Dem nominee.
C: (1.000%) T: @RSHunter71 That‚Äôs why you made fun of Elizabeth Warren, why you on the right are happy that the Dayton shooter said something ok about her. You think,  see the left is promoting violence. Not that he was a deranged person.
C: (0.985%) T: Elizabeth Warren Promises to Kill State Laws That Ban Locally-Owned ISPs - #hero #warren2020 https://t.co/teHfIO81fR
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN I don't remember Elizabeth Warren or Sanders attacking Dayton Ohio's Oregon area on a weekly basis do you?
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Is Elizabeth Warren responsible for Dayton, Ohio‚Äôs shooting since he supoorted her? No. Quit using tragedies for political gain.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs campaign just called me ‚Äî and it wasn‚Äôt a donation or volunteering ask. (I‚Äôve donated.) The caller asked me (a) my key issues and (b) who I would vote for if the primary was today. Pretty cool!
C: (0.999%) T: @isaacbmcginty @NBCNews Such weak mindedness. The sh00ter in OH is a big Elizabeth Warren fan.   When will you be calling for her to drop out of the race since that sh00ting is all her fault, using your logic?    Yeah, just as I thought.
C: (1.000%) T: @BooBooNyc @RepAlGreen And then there was all that white supremacy in Dayton...in fact the murderer must have been inspired by his two favorite white 1%ers Berine Sanders and Elizabeth Warren or was progressive socialist #ConnorBetts under orders to cleanse #Deplorables ü§™
C: (1.000%) T: @ArleneAdamo @CornelWest @BBCWorld Elizabeth Warren. And I know she use to be a Republican BEFORE she became a Senator.....but at least I don't have to regurgitate Bernie's LIE that he's always been on the right side of history.   Brady bill? Immigration? Afghanistan? Yugoslavia? Shall I go on?
C: (1.000%) T: The Real Winners of the Second Debate Were Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders Tuesday night‚Äôs vibrant ideological clashes, which saw the two progressive senators fend off ‚ÄúRepublican talking point‚Äù jibes from debate moderators and centrist... https://t.co/AgqoxFZmHx
C: (0.965%) T: @LetsTwe84498325 @ThyLordJesus @MitchKSmith Even if he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter (which I doubt) , does she spread violent vitriolic hate? NO. Does she spread racism on a daily basis? NO. Does she attack people on a daily basis on her Twitter account &amp; interviews? NO. TRUMP DOES.
C: (1.000%) T: @SebGorka @SalemMediaGrp let's see the guy was Elizabeth Warren supporter the guys supported antifa and he was a socialist but Twitter and others don't want people to know that it didn't fit the narrative wonder why
C: (0.987%) T: @WTNH The Ohio gunman supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's plan to support rural communities, including medical access and broadband, and revitalizing small farms while incentivizing environmental innovation. https://t.co/uhPW9enOYu
C: (1.000%) T: .@ewarren wants to help farmers sell their goods at a fair price, and will offer them loans to cover the cost of production. If they can't sell on the free market, the government will buy back their goods for storage in reserves.  https://t.co/Rcx6ZZPnKY via @DMRegister
