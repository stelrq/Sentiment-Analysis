C: (1.000%) T: @troytrilla @redmission84 @TherightNegan @sir_tone00 @dcexaminer @UniversalPics @billmaher The guy in Ohio I believe was an Elizabeth Warren supporter who supported far left ideas but okay.
C: (1.000%) T: @UuppityNegro @ElieNYC @SenKamalaHarris True. But he‚Äôs a known quantity, &amp; vetted by Obama‚Äîthat counts huge. Kamala‚Äôs wobbly when not rehearsed‚Äî&amp; it‚Äôs starting to show. I see Elizabeth Warren gliding in 1st if Joe falls out of favor.  I‚Äôm team Pete, but not tied to outcomes like a normal elex. We just gotta WIN.
C: (0.988%) T: @ErnestLamonica @FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump @BernieSanders The one in Ohio was a Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @Scaramucci Sorry it's tough to trust anyone who went to work for the Trump Administrations. Even if only for a week. On Bill Maher's show Friday, "If Elizabeth Warren is nominated, Trump will win 44 states." That's exactly what he wanted you to say. He was watching to make sure you did.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) has been a frequent visitor at The Swan Dispatch. And the song "Royals" by Lorde just sprung into my head. #observations
C: (0.760%) T: @RepStevenSmith @truthcraving This despicable murder of an innocent man shows the level of racism and intolerance in our country.   Signed -  Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris
C: (1.000%) T: Joe Biden has had a steady lead in Iowa polls, but Democratic strategists say Elizabeth Warren is rising and poses the greatest risk to him in the Hawkeye state.   Iowa has long been seen... https://t.co/ichbYbYeR2

C: (0.999%) T: @gavinivester @DineshDSouza I‚Äôm a native-born American with at least as much Native American blood as Elizabeth Warren. I fully support legal immigration. I detest the illegal kind. Send the parents back with their children. Better yet, don‚Äôt let them in.
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren is a serial liar. This needs to be addressed. Looks like she pulled the tweet down  https://t.co/u2w7dSXWFD  https://t.co/BAHMQ1OGCc
C: (1.000%) T: @tiernanlaw @calebjohnson84 @DadTexans @heckyessica üò≠" Trumpy's against pot smoking , I'm not voting for him ,I'd rather have a leftist loony like Elizabeth Warren  win the election because of that one topic "üôÑStop attacking conservatives on silly issues .
C: (1.000%) T: This really put a huge dent in my support for Elizabeth Warren. Voting machines were shown at #DEFCON to be completely hackable. Even able to change votes. We need to be rid of the voting machine system. #votingreformnow https://t.co/p8D6PRXNf6 https://t.co/prroVz3cBv

C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson Beto seems to still be talking philosophy &amp; sociology. He needs to get to policies like Elizabeth Warren. I want to hear more concrete things. How does his philosophy turn into laws &amp; policies? We definitely have to add more morality &amp; ethics laws in all 3 branches!
C: (1.000%) T: @Railgunbikes @clay0nline @Brendan77894830 @nelsonwendella @Thee_Roxy_Cox @realDonaldTrump Never was a fan! But I do like Elizabeth Warren on most of her policies, though not all! But there are a ton of Republicans auditioning for positions only to lay on the sword for our President! Just ask Ratcliffe
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a liberal supremacist.  I said yes.  SO to @RealCandaceO !
C: (1.000%) T: @realJOHalloran @STabbytosavit Elizabeth Warren. Even if I didn't have other excellent reasons, such as she &amp; Kamala Harris are far better candidates than the run-of-the-mill old fogies you name, I'd pick one of the two to defy just another misognynistic poll.
