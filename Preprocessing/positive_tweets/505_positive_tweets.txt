C: (1.000%) T: I will do it but begrudgingly, knowing Sanders could have acted with honor when it was clear HTC was going to be the nominee. But, he didn't did he. I'm supporting and voting for Senator Elizabeth Warren in the primary. The important thing is that we #VoteThemOut https://t.co/MbVu2wrjoE
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren in Iowa claims that the 1 percent of millionaires in this country can eliminate all student debt! What a crock and every sane person knows a pander for votes when you hear it! Do Democrats think Americans are stupid enough to believe this falsehood? NO WAY!!

C: (0.985%) T: @MollyJongFast He's always been awful. He went right from the gross bloody sock to campaigning for Bush Jr. He also was planning to run against Elizabeth Warren last year but realized that he'd get whooped in MA.
C: (1.000%) T: I like both Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren was quick to call for Trump's impeachment, and Trump's impeachment is also a major cause that Tom Steyer supports with his words and with his money. #ImpeachmentHearingsNow https://t.co/Guqu4GIBYn
C: (0.813%) T: @benshapiro Yeah, and Elizabeth Warren lives like a pauper.
C: (1.000%) T: When big corporations pay tax IT IS STILL PEOPLE PAYING TAX . Let the stock holders give to the charities of their choice. And when big corporations pay tax that means the stock holders get less money. What right does Elizabeth Warren have to tell big corporations how to donate?
C: (1.000%) T: @johnpavlovitz @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump need to apologize together. Their rhetoric caused 2 shootings last weekend.

C: (0.726%) T: @Trinitymcclain5 @keanothedog @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren didn't inspire violence with anything she has said or done. Trump was quoted by the El Paso shooter in his manifesto. There's a big difference.

C: (0.538%) T: @drawandstrike Elizabeth Warren has called for government run broadband instead of telecom companies
C: (0.951%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Yea because Elizabeth Warren stands up on stage and urges people to hate brown and black people (especially if they are from another country). Warren stands up on stage and feeds fear to people or suggests violence is appropriate as a solution?  Not at all.
C: (1.000%) T: @BadClamJuice @HermanBrood2015 @BernieSanders Corey Booker, Joe Biden, AOC, Elizabeth Warren, Kamela Harris, and all of the others who are trying to open our borders, offer free stuff to illegals, criticizing our ICE and law enforcement agents, calling white republicans racists for no reason... shall I go on?
C: (0.999%) T: @rebeccabguinn @JohnCornyn Did you know the shooter in Ohio is an extrem leftist supporter of Elizabeth Warren. Did u know it was a Sanders supporter that shot up the republicans BB game almost killing a Congress member. Antifa attack on detention center in Tacoma and gay Asian reporter in Oregon.
C: (0.829%) T: @iansmadrig @atrupar how is that?   when the Bernie bro shut up the GOP charity baseball field did you go out for Bernie where is hateful rhetoric? or how about the Ohio shooter who is Elizabeth Warren fan shouldn't you be condemning her and are hateful rhetoric? or is it only Trump?

C: (0.999%) T: @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The El Paso killer wrote a screed parroting Trump's immigrant invasion rhetoric, targeted Mexicans.  The Dayton killing like Elizabeth Warren, targeted his sister.  Stop straining to make these equals.  They will never be equal.
