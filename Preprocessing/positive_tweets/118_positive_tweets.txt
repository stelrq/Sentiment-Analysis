C: (1.000%) T: @NikalKatha @AmyMcGrathKY How is this when both shooters supported Democrats - one Bernie and the other Elizabeth Warren? Talk about misguided... now what do you say?
C: (1.000%) T: @JulianCastro Why are leaving out the fact that he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, a Democrat Socialist, just like you.  Oh, and he was an avowed Satanist.  Socialism, Democrats &amp; Satanism - that is the trinity for what we saw in Dayton. The Dem Socialist's rhetoric is to blame for it.
C: (1.000%) T: Just blocked Mayor Pete, Elizabeth Warren and John Legend for stoking racial tensions. No tolerance

C: (0.990%) T: üö®Elizabeth Warren has announced a new plan, and it‚Äôs for rural dwellers! https://t.co/TpGqPoFtn4
C: (1.000%) T: @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I will state publicly that I've sent donations to Mayor Pete &amp; Elizabeth Warren.  Obviously, I can't send them the maximum amount, but even if I could/did, you can't shame me into feeling bad about this.  Why are you so upset about your people?  Get off your high horse.
C: (0.976%) T: This Rhetoric is what Sparks hate &amp; violence. This same lady you hear is seen giving Liz HERRING (Elizabeth Warren) a hug. Go Figure! Her supporters are the hate instigators &amp; fueling the fire! https://t.co/STrnv4HC0H

C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren you are so full of yourself it is sickening. If you did things to please yourself but you are doing everything to make a few happy. Medicare for all is stupid and you know that. The Bible says judge ye not that thou shall not be judged. Welcome to hell
C: (1.000%) T: @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dayton shooter. Leftist. Sounds like Elizabeth Warren. Enamored with Elizabeth Warren. Wants to vote for @SenWarren. Get it?  Brain forgot that line of soy boy logic?
C: (1.000%) T: @BreeNewsome @CapehartJ The Dayton shooter was a pure Left Wing radical supporting Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren he also supported Antifa and called the Antifa Terrorist who attacked ICE a ‚Äúmartyr.‚Äù   Then of course there‚Äôs the man who actually gunned down Steve Scalise who was a BernieBro.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Bernie and Elizabeth Warren aren't spewing hate and violence daily. Do you even know what Antifa means? Antifa is defined as groups opposed to fascism and other forms of extreme right-wing ideology. Of course, YOU OPPOSE them, they are against everything you stand for.
C: (1.000%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl And this is wildly inappropriate. You are dozing people and stirring up hate. Donald trump is not the cause of that shooter just like Elizabeth Warren is not responsible for the Dayton shooter. Stop being a child and act like an adult
C: (1.000%) T: 1/5  constantly say things anti-Semitic &amp; anti-American. The Dayton shooter was an avid fan of Elizabeth Warren. The shooter on the ball field was a Bernie Sanders fan. Even when Trump tones down &amp; makes a very nice speech of unity the LEFT still goes WILD calling him RACIST
C: (1.000%) T: @whyw84me @GottaFollowHim @Comedyfan2017 @ShannonSharpe @CNN Nah buddy. It was actually quite funny to watch. ‚ÄúWe searched the Ohio killers social media and discovered he is..... an Elizabeth Warren supporter... now back to 10 hours of taking about ONLY the El Paso shooter!
C: (1.000%) T: @w_terrence @BetoORourke Just like Elizabeth Warren faked being and Indian Beto is a Irish paddy and faked being hispanic for political gain.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump If there is truth to these 2 stories it should be spread far and wide.  Thank you for being, and staying strong.  üôÇüá∫üá≤  #KAG #QAnon  https://t.co/Wvo8V6c6DP  https://t.co/wNxm3ZFZH7
C: (0.889%) T: @repjohnlewis So can we blame Ohio on Elizabeth Warren following your logic? Or more appropriate lack thereof.
C: (0.987%) T: Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan ‚Äòleftist‚Äô who supported Elizabeth Warren  - https://t.co/0JwUViiGcr - @washtimes #TNM  @tnmorg
C: (1.000%) T: @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @OANN And I would bet Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, if true, will speak out against people like this supporting them.
C: (1.000%) T: This is the stupidest hashtag ever.  He published public info. If you contribute to a candidate, the  you should be proud to stand byt it. he didn‚Äôt doxx anyone, no contact info, no addresses.  I hope more people do it. FYI I gave to Elizabeth Warren #ImpeachJoaquinCastro
