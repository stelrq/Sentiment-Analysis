C: (1.000%) T: I heard a rumor that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth warren aka Pocahontas have entered into a partner ship to create a new business comparable to dollar general and family dollar. This new store is going to be nationwide and known as FREE S#IT for the FAMILY
C: (1.000%) T: Those kids definitely knew they could charge whatever they wanted to for that lemonade. What is Elizabeth Warren going to do? Refuse to pay for it? Hah! She doesn't want that bad press. These girls knew what they were doing. https://t.co/KXYJ9kC7Km
C: (0.990%) T: @robreiner I've noticed you never talk about the Elizabeth Warren, gun regulations loving, pro antifa communist shooter in Dayton Ohio.
C: (1.000%) T: @WajahatAli If Sanders wasn't in the race, Elizabeth Warren would be leading right now.
C: (1.000%) T: If Elizabeth Warren wins the US presidency, sheâ€™ll be the American Mary Robinson.   I think about this a lot.
C: (1.000%) T: @rhodeislander @aiki14 @TheBabylonBee yes, i get it. it is a Dick Move.  that's what Democrats do. just like keying a car in portland that has a bumper sticker to the right of elizabeth warren. or burning down a political sign on someone's yard in sellwood pdx. that's what Democrats do. makes me laugh. what can I do?
C: (1.000%) T: I feel like these girls just hustled Elizabeth Warren. Or that 15 dollar minimum wage is killing the lemonade business. https://t.co/PxAgGZyYFi
C: (1.000%) T: @BadMammyBlog @StefanMolyneux Always wanted to know if white people born in South Africa consider themselves to be African American!! ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”  But hey, if the WASPy Elizabeth Warren can convince the world sheâ€™s Native American, then you can call yourself whatever you want. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
C: (0.982%) T: @PhillyInquirer If Elizabeth Warren or any Democrat had been fear-mongering, painting others as invading enemies, encouraging violence or race-baiting, they would be partly responsible. They haven't. Trump has.

C: (1.000%) T: 2 of 2: Elizabeth Warren told the NYTimes "without hesitation" that Trump gave white supremacists aid &amp; comfort. "Heâ€™s done the wink and a nod..He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. Heâ€™s done everything he can to stir up racial conflict &amp;hatred in this country." https://t.co/NiavHKgISU
C: (1.000%) T: Iâ€™m an Elizabeth Warren guy, but Kamala Harris impresses the hell out of me as wellâ€”sitting down for an interview with Ron Burgandy is a genius move (and really funny, too.) https://t.co/IDB72Va4sH
C: (1.000%) T: We all know I'm with Liz, but this story further cements *why.*  https://t.co/AVoZRpFwBx
C: (0.987%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren When Elizabeth Warren is president the Lemonade would cost $7 but you have to pay $10 for tax.   Starbucks would be $35 per cup.
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris If you donâ€™t think Elizabeth Warren for your vice President Iâ€™m not going to vote for you. In 2020 I want to sing enjoy. ðŸŽ¼ who runs the world girls ðŸŽ¹who runs the world girlsðŸŽ¼ðŸ˜‚
C: (1.000%) T: @melly01085108 @gasgirly @BroodingHamlet @AOC @senatemajldr The one in Ohio supported Elizabeth Warren and antifa, the one in El Paso was triggered by those ridiculous democrat debates. Where do you get your news. The left is behind the shootings for distraction purposes. Pay attention
C: (0.995%) T: Did I say, Joe Biden for President and Elizabeth Warren for Vice President this week? ðŸ˜Ž
C: (0.749%) T: I cannot wait to vote for this woman. I cannot wait until she's my president. https://t.co/IgmbmwKLNa via @thecut
C: (1.000%) T: @DiamondandSilk Out of the nine victims this Elizabeth Warren supporting lunatic killed,  there sure were a lot of African Americans in the group- actually a majority.  @ewarren has got some explaining to do.  Why are your Antifa supporters seemingly targeting black people?
C: (0.986%) T: Or a Black girl stanning Elizabeth Warren when you have Kamala Harris ðŸ™ƒ. https://t.co/mVlHIP1yLI
C: (1.000%) T: Interesting thread that needs to be read by anyone looking for a democratic candidate right now . This thread pertains to Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/x6OZdBH7Y8
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says screw your ISP. Letâ€™s make the internet a public utility https://t.co/bBuMPvObNi
C: (1.000%) T: If Elizabeth Warren just bought lemonade from young girls in Iowa for $7, I think we just found two more women who should be considered run @WellsFargo https://t.co/cpApUpEr19
C: (1.000%) T: @miapapaya @RyanAFournier @amnesty Death rates in USA  Trump dosent care? So now your a mind reader?  The Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  The El Paso shooter hated democrats&amp;republicans, corporations, automation. https://t.co/j2cTG6idRz
C: (1.000%) T: @AG_Conservative @FoundersGirl Elizabeth Warren is working on a plan to reduce the size of the federal government down to 2 departments.  The Department of Give and the Department of Take.
