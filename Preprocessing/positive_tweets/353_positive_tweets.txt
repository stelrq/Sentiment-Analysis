C: (1.000%) T: @morningmika This is sarcasm, right? Even you cannot be stupid enough to think that Robert Francis, he of Beto, the fake Mexican name, has a chance to be president on the blood of these victims. If Trump is responsible for El Pso, Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton.

C: (1.000%) T: So her plan is to make them less affordable to poor people. Last time I checked, it was middle and upper class white dudes who were committing mass murders. I don't think doubling the price of a gun will stop them. https://t.co/624czdB9La

C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris So who is copying who.  You or Elizabeth Warren?  Both running for President,  Both bring up that Ferguson üí© again, and I imagine if that talk started riots up again, you both and the DemonRats will blame President Trump

C: (0.987%) T: @KatGkannon @KamalaHarris Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris both need to drop out of the race.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is a racist attempting to secure the black vote by stirring racial hatred. When has she done anything to help anyone ?  Her past actions indicate she has done more harm than good on her quest for power.
