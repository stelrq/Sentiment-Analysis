C: (0.988%) T: @AIIAmericanGirI @FoxNews Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kammala Harris are bigger threats to the USA than ISIS and Climate Change combined.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren If you love the fossil fuels that cause climate change, the for-profit healthcare that bankrupts families and billionaires influencing policies and elections, then you will love Elizabeth Warren and her PAC for a Level Playing Field and her Contributors. https://t.co/58Tx7M0Nn4
C: (1.000%) T: @schwimmyschwim I appreciate your choice in shirt and photo series with Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @elizahecht @Educated2143 @fkajenn @BrandonStraka @TaritaC @AlyceLMiller @McNeilJaden What about you.  Where did your family originate?  Unless you are Elizabeth Warren or a Native American you are not from this country.  I’m betting you have a lot of intersections.

C: (1.000%) T: @TimRunsHisMouth Ying and Yang signs I believe.  Check with Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris to be sure.
C: (0.974%) T: @frannie174 @ewarren What does that even mean. How does Elizabeth Warren eminate hate? Especially when compared to the man she wants to run against in 2020.

C: (1.000%) T: I wrote this song “Battle Cry” a few years ago, but now every day it’s like Elizabeth Warren is literally singing these lyrics, so I’m giving my song to her now, dedicated to her fearless fight!   “Battle Cry”  https://t.co/1QROvwMQZs

C: (0.988%) T: @EWErickson Your Trump is a white supremacist dumpster fire 24/7, and an occasional assaulter who periodically accuses, untruthfully and without foundation, Hillary Clinton of murder and other crimes. So you need another way to complain about coverage of Elizabeth Warren. Erick.
C: (1.000%) T: @c_angelc419 @Axeman4guitars @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Oh we haven't, but the left leaning liberal media has forgot about the Ohio shooting every since ot went against their naritave. And that guy was proven to be a Elizabeth Warren  and Antifa supporter and anti Trump. Funny how thay works isn't it?
C: (0.994%) T: @maggieNYT Now do the socialist Dayton shooter that was a fan of Elizabeth Warren. #eotp

C: (1.000%) T: @Spratlinger @HashtagGriswold @baseballcrank I appreciate Elizabeth Warren recognizing that just because a system that has proven to accept "he was black" as "reasonable fear" legally concludes no murder, doesn't really mean a murder didn't occur.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Change the name from Elizabeth Warren to Donald trump and this statement is completely true.

C: (1.000%) T: Welp, it's official - I just set up a regular donation to Elizabeth Warren's campaign and offered to volunteer.
C: (1.000%) T: @RealTimers @billmaher @JoeBiden @HBO The "senior moments" will make the debates laughable. Trump will go for the jugular and win. Dems need Bernie or Elizabeth Warren. A shift to the left to win. Recent polls show Bernie beats Trump 50% to 42%. Sanders has a better chance to beat Trump. He's a mentally agile fighter
C: (0.774%) T: blasts Warren for tweet claiming Michael Brown was murdered https://t.co/TNmer2KUmG #FoxNews Formerly "Pocahontas" and now "The Great White Buffalo" Elizabeth Warren is an irresponsible individual. Her statement help create violence between criminals and the police!
C: (1.000%) T: @fras99 When Trump loses in 2020, I will still loathe the man because, through his Tweets, he will try to make Elizabeth Warren's presidency a misery. She will ignore him, but the rest of us will be up in arms every day.
