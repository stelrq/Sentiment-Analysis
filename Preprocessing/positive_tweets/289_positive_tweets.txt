C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn I have a true question. Why haven't the news media ask Elizabeth Warren on her take of the Dayton shooter being one of her own? Or ask AOC that her rhetoric was repeated by the same shooter?
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I can‚Äôt think of even one positive thing that Elizabeth Warren has actually done during her political career or even said on the campaign trail.   America won‚Äôt elect a negative do nothing üëéüèº
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps It's a compliment,  no matter what that asshat says. I'd rather look like Elizabeth Warren than anyone he admires.

C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Twenty years ago it would have been inconceivable for anyone as far Left as Elizabeth Warren to become the Democratic nominee. Thirty years ago she could not have been elected to the Senate and 40 years ago could not have been elected dogcatcher. The reason: Demographic change.

C: (1.000%) T: @plottmom1 @RosettiRay @gdirtydime @robbystarbuck @tribelaw And Bernie Sanders was responsible for Steve Scalise‚Äôs attempted murder, correct? How about Elizabeth Warren? Is she responsible for those murdered in Dayton?
