C: (0.993%) T: anyone wanna go in on elizabeth warren stickers they're 3 for $10 or 2 magnets for $15 ðŸ‘€
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren visited two young girls' lemonade stand. She paid $7  for a cup of lemonade and tipped them $3. Wow, I am surprised she didn't demand they be regulated by the government and take half of their earnings to share their wealth.
C: (0.983%) T: @TheRevAl Then Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton and Bernie for the Republican shooter.
C: (0.986%) T: @Bookwormroom Not one person asked me if Elizabeth Warren is Bat Sh_ _ Crazy, because everyone already knows that of course she is.
C: (0.985%) T: @TheRevAl What about the Dayton shooter, a self proclaimed leftist, socialist, and Elizabeth Warren supporter? Not to mention registered democrat?
C: (0.996%) T: I love Elizabeth Warren!!!!   I mean true LOVE @ewarren
C: (1.000%) T: @Caterfree10 @ewarren I donâ€™t think please and a slurpee will convince a murderer to surrender.  If someone breaks into your house please call Elizabeth Warren not the police. She will save you Iâ€™m sure
C: (1.000%) T: I love Elizabeth Warren, I think it's important to like/admire our politicians as people to an extent... but when this is taken to the level of "and that's why I'm voting for her!" it's distracting, no matter how cute the kids, how charming the grandma selfies
C: (1.000%) T: My suggestion for Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s new Twitter profile:  U.S. Senator, former teacher, former Native American, and candidate for president. Wife, mom, nails, whiskey, brain surgery, and pandering whore.
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke What about the Ohio shooter? The one who supported Antifa and socialism and was a big Elizabeth Warren supporter. If Trump is responsible for El Paso then, by your logic, shouldnâ€™t Elisabeth Warren be responsible for the Ohio murders?
C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren I was asked today if Elizabeth Warren would ever be president. I said no.
C: (1.000%) T: @jowebsteraussie @SBSNews now lets concentrate on the dayton shooter. obviously socialism and elizabeth warren made him do it.
C: (1.000%) T: @ManMet80 @Reuters My favorite response now: Why do we need Bernie when weâ€™ve got Elizabeth Warren. They hate that.
C: (0.995%) T: I know I frequently quote William F. Buckley to slag Elizabeth Warren...... https://t.co/Oh30MNRtN8
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if the Dayton murderer was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  I said yes.
C: (0.993%) T: @ewarren So who is the big racist? Democrats Republicans? Elizabeth Warren certainly is! https://t.co/Z4Jum719qQ
C: (0.978%) T: @sameerzden @SBSNews by that logic then elizabeth warren is responsible for the dayton shooter. Or are you going to ignore that shooting because his allegiances don't fit your trump hating narrative.
C: (1.000%) T: @nytpolitics Elizabeth Warren is best POTUS 2020. She'll take us in new direction of clean, green, fair government inclusive of all. Save our democracy &amp; rule of law. White male Sexist Racist Biden establishment doesn't represent Dem party or country. Fight Sexism, Save America! #Warren2020
C: (0.987%) T: Wearing a thin, silk, summer weight cardigan at night these days, as a gesture of solidarity with Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Today we were asked if Elizabeth Warren tried to use race science in 2018 to falsely claim she was Cherokee against the wishes of the Cherokee people. We said yes. https://t.co/nifG883mw9
C: (0.719%) T: I literally only have 2 people Iâ€™d vote for in the election: Elizabeth Warren and Beto Oâ€™Rourke
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is best POTUS 2020. She'll take us in new direction of clean, green, fair government inclusive of all. Save our democracy &amp; rule of law.

C: (0.847%) T: @CamEdwards @KurtSchlichter The facts are this...We have proof trumps racist and no proof Elizabeth Warren is Native American. Letâ€™s support the non racist seems way way less vile.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren...never one to allow facts to get in the way of a good story. Brown was not "murdered" much like you are not native American. https://t.co/Me4kRkPTs4
C: (0.715%) T: @ewarren Democrats are the big racist, including Elizabeth Warren! https://t.co/Z4Jum719qQ
