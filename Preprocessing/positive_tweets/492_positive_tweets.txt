C: (0.995%) T: If the El Paso demonstrators say Trump has blood on his hands that obviously Elizabeth Warren also has blood on her hands #ElizabethWarren #DemocraticParty #ElizabethWarren2020
C: (1.000%) T: "I will make sure every home in America has a fiber broadband connection at a price families can afford. That means publicly-owned and operated networks ‚Äî and no giant ISPs running away with taxpayer dollars" - Elizabeth Warren  #Warren2020 #YesWePlan  https://t.co/Ji0jl1C4p7
C: (0.988%) T: Bernie Sanders condemns Senator Elizabeth Warren following Dayton, Ohio, shooting. (A Parody) https://t.co/Gtp7MMLiMB
C: (0.969%) T: Apparently, the Dayton shooter's social media history indicates "leftist leanings," along with support for gun control,  satan, and Elizabeth Warren.  Perhaps we should not be so quick to try to connect dots and assign blame.  #disingenuous #partisan #games https://t.co/DAlAmJKOIp
C: (1.000%) T: @EmperorGrinnar @Leenich @chootchyface @piersmorgan Does this suit the topic better. More Media and Democrat lies. Dayton shooter reportedly supported gun control, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Saunder, Satanism and socialism  https://t.co/Hx7l7FN9Pi
C: (0.997%) T: @TrueGSC @thehill @realDonaldTrump @ewarren Because the Dayton shooter, to our knowledge, didn't go on a rampage in the name of Elizabeth Warren polices and what she preaches, but the shooter in El Paso did.
C: (0.542%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN GO FUCK YOURSELF. No one is being radicalized at Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren rallies you cunt.
C: (1.000%) T: @mccullian @Chinohoven Seriously though, Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have nothing to do with someone shooting up a walmart and you‚Äôll never convince me so. So please let me carry on with my day.
C: (1.000%) T: Best friend from home has banged on rural broadband as a key development tool. I've poo-pooed him as I am not convinced that simple connectivity can overcome the advantages of being in the same "meat space."  Politics aside, what do folks make of this?  https://t.co/Ka22sQavzu
C: (0.984%) T: im very happy to see a candidate is bringing this issue into the conversation https://t.co/zyqfFr4xZ4
C: (0.966%) T: @Harry81279233 @CNN Elizabeth Warren did not encourage violence. Trump did. He laughed when supporters yelled "Shoot Them!" at a rally.    Supporting Trump is unAmerican, because he is.   He is the antithesis of true American values. He lies and has zero self-awareness. So do many of his supporters.

C: (0.999%) T: @edwardbrowden @malindanina @jonfitztv @onerealchris @CNN Let's be real...the guy supported gun control, socialism, Elizabeth warren and Bernie Sanders and was a racist mass murderer. Are those facts you accept?
C: (1.000%) T: @UberFacts @Barnes_Law Total racket and a contributing factor to the escalation of college costs... and so is Elizabeth Warren getting paid $400,000 to teach a class she could do online for free to give back instead of supporting raising more taxes from us to fund this reckless spending
C: (0.988%) T: @JeffreyGuterman @DonaldJTrumpJr Why does antifa support Biden support Elizabeth Warren support Bernie Sanders?Think about itüòõ
C: (1.000%) T: THIS is why I love @ewarren so much. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt teach to show you how smart I am, I teach to show you how smart you are.‚Äù This is exactly the kind of empathy we need in a leader.   https://t.co/q2ylNihRnE
C: (1.000%) T: @elivalley Did the Dayton shooter quote Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs comprehensive child care plan in his manifesto? üôÑ   Were his targets people who Sanders said were ‚Äúinvaders‚Äù? üôÑ
C: (1.000%) T: @LAforWarren I think part of it is that headlines that are questions or seem controversial are shown to get more clicks. So it's like we incentivize some genuinely good articles to use terrible headlines. "Elizabeth Warren: Constantly Amazing" is perhaps not as spicy.
C: (1.000%) T: by trying to provide internet access to those in rural communities, elizabeth warren just made herself a powerful enemy: HughesNet Gen4 https://t.co/Ev26j43gaj
C: (1.000%) T: @karen_genrich @BrandonStraka Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt incite violence the way tRump does. He knows his supporters are gun-loving, white nationalists. He revels in firing them up to do his bidding. Hitler used the same tactics.
C: (1.000%) T: @R9gerJames @iheartmindy @ewarren @senatemajldr There is no Cherokee DNA. But there are very thorough genealogical records. Nope thorough than most white people: https://t.co/P8qlz9Fw97
C: (1.000%) T: @BethanyBeeches @LisaParisot @brianstelter @murphy @ArtemisChats Don‚Äôt tell me or us to stop! This is evil pure and simple! You have every right to feel the way you do but I will Not put this on the President.  The right is not violent - it‚Äôs the mentally ill.  And the killer from Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren fan - liberal/democrat - left.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the heart of really great teaching, It‚Äôs that I believe in you. I don‚Äôt get up and teach to show how smart I am.
