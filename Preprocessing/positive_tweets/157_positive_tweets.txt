C: (1.000%) T: @kausmickey @AnnCoulter @washingtonpost @nytimes Lemme splain it to you Mickey. Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt espouse hate, bigotry and racism as #dumpytrump does. She doesn‚Äôt encourage her base to ‚Äòpunch‚Äô protestors in the face and promise to pay their legal bill like your leader does. (He reneged on paying them) what a shocker
C: (0.858%) T: @CrummyDogLover @charliekirk11 What an insult this is you people are in my  country for unlike your stooge Elizabeth warren I am an original American so you are In my country and maybe should get the hell out.  We don‚Äôtlike stupid people so you are welcome to head for Venezuela‚Äôs anytime now.
C: (0.995%) T: @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Hey racist Ted,  that Dayton shooter was a far leftist democrat that loved Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA.
C: (0.995%) T: @TraitorTrumpKFC @RachelD34535677 @JoaquinCastrotx @jewishaction And don‚Äôt forget Dayton.  Wait.  Sorry, he was an Antifa loving, Elizabeth Warren supporting, left wing whack job.  But we won‚Äôt talk about that, will we?
C: (1.000%) T: @SpauldingKade @TheDemocrats not in dayton   in Dayton he was a democrat Elizabeth warren supporting leftist  https://t.co/cZ6h9fjcJI
C: (0.988%) T: FYI: The Dayton Shooter Was Pro-Antifa and Wanted to Vote For Elizabeth Warren - so is #WarrenToBlame ? On #DemocratsNewRules apparently, she is  https://t.co/oYPWf6x6MJ
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Hey Joe!  You DO KNOW the Ohio Shooter is an ELIZABETH WARREN devout SUPPORTER!  Why aren't you bitching about THAT?  Oh yeah, not in your Deep State Talking Points you recite daily like a good little puppet.
C: (1.000%) T: Interesting take on @EWarren's ideas on trade, which also discusses her intent to link market access to #FossilFuelSubsidies. Sharing does not imply endorsement, though I, too, would like to understand the devils residing in the details of Warren's plans.  https://t.co/zS6WskvzMO
C: (1.000%) T: @LifesDecOfCards As an individual. Like some of the candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Andrew are very aware of some of the needs for the black community and has plans to implement certain policies so gotta give her that
C: (1.000%) T: @WontBeSilent2 @luisXIII511 @KSTiLLS @ANM90 Good idea. Elizabeth Warren should give out Scholarships to Indians who she hurt with her own money. When she talks about the rich she is a millionaire from a Site called guess who: Pochantos. It's now changed. So our President had the right to call her that name.
C: (1.000%) T: @BreitbartNews The manifesto doesn't fit the media's agenda so they ignore it. Judt as they ignore the facts of the Dayton shooter's support for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. You can't trust the biased media to be honest about anything.
C: (0.594%) T: @RockyMountViews @SawyerHackett @JetScoozr77 So the Dayton shooter was a Elizabeth Warren and Antifa supporter. The guy that shot up the Republican congressman playing baseball was a Bernie supporter. Are they putting people's lives in danger or do we just chalk it up to crazy people shooting innocent citizens?
C: (1.000%) T: @mwest410 @bourgeoisalien @FrankConniff Absolutely a Progressive.   ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren is a very good friend of mine, I have known her for a long time, before she was in the Senate.  She is a great US Senator.  She has stood up to Wall St.  She has stood up to the Big Money interests.‚Äù - Bernie Sanders
C: (0.984%) T: @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The Dayton killer didn‚Äôt have a manifesto heavily influenced by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren quotes.   YOU PEOPLE are the ones constantly dehumanizing and othering Latino populations.
C: (1.000%) T: Democrats love to downplay the lengths to which they have gone to go full socialist, but there is no denying it anymore.  Elizabeth Warren wants to seize the means of production, which is the definition of socialism. https://t.co/Z6AWakElT4

C: (0.998%) T: @chrislongview I was just telling my aunt how people felt about HRC (they didn‚Äôt trust her blah blah) was how I felt about Elizabeth Warren. I lost my aunt, uncle and cousin to the AIDS epidemic during the early 90s. I don‚Äôt trust anyone who voted Republican during those days.
C: (0.999%) T: @robreiner You forgot about, and failed to mention, the shooter who was a leftist, Elizabeth Warren supporter. You are the evil one and you have no credibility.
