C: (1.000%) T: Actually Byron, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúamazing‚Äù or even out of the ordinary. The Democrats have choreographed a scorch and burn campaign on unity in our country. They can‚Äôt win with truth, they‚Äôre banking on divide and conquer.  Elizabeth Warren is only following Obama‚Äôs lead. https://t.co/w5winY3NnK

C: (1.000%) T: @RepMaxineWaters When was the last time an NRA member committed a mass shooting? Why don't you focus on the last two when one was Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders supporter and a Democratic Socialist As You Are

C: (1.000%) T: @atDavidHoffman @KamalaHarris what if they are purchased by a black supremacist or BLANK supremacist or brown supremacist or women supremacist or liberal supremacist (like the elizabeth warren supporter - Dayton or steve scalise bernie supporter?)
C: (1.000%) T: @DanCChamberlain I remember when I was in high school and there was a beautiful biracial girl who told me that blacks hated her. Black girls were openly hostile to her. If there is so much white privilege, why is Elizabeth Warren saying she is Indian, and Beto trying to be Hispanic?
C: (1.000%) T: "The Dayton situation, he was a fan of Antifa. He was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Nothing to do with #Trump, but nobody ever mentions that." Trump. I had little reservations but now its proved that #TrumpIsARacist &amp; #TrumpIsARat #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW

C: (1.000%) T: I'd ask them to think seriously about which people will be the first to have Mental Health Red Flags under a President Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren, but I'm not sure serious thought is really a thing...
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN Explain the El Paso shooter, who was a fan boy of Elizabeth warren and proud ANTIFA member. Pretty sure those are left wing groups
C: (0.513%) T: @SenSherrodBrown No one blames you or Elizabeth Warren for the crazed Liberal Dayton shooter.
C: (0.983%) T: @fn_katz @FredTJoseph Poor sole. Elizabeth Warren is a nut job!
C: (1.000%) T: I remember learning about this idea &amp; writing about it for one of my application essays to American University 3 years ago! From the Chattanooga example to @AbdulElSayed focusing on it in the 2018 MI GOV primary to this, the idea is mainstream! 1/x https://t.co/CY70okwBCr
C: (0.777%) T: @WFSB - Motive in Dayton?  He was an angry antifa-type democrat in favor of gun control and Elizabeth Warren.  Democrat rhetoric clearly set him off.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Mr. President, show me footage of Elizabeth Warren calling for violence or laughing at suggestions of violence.   That's the difference, sir. If you truly condemn white supremacists, you'll declare it at your next rally and stop racially based speech. Your words matter. #BeBetter

C: (1.000%) T: @Carrasquillo @JoaquinCastrotx @newrepublic Ok fair is fair.  Here's the Ohio shooter that said he was a strong supporter of @SenWarren and wants everyone to vote blue.  Wanted socialism like the rest of you idiots.  This one is on #HER. https://t.co/HFbKF6cya5

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Now is the time to HOLD ELIZABETH WARREN accountable for each and every Ohio shooting death.  According to her own logic, if Trump is responsible for the El Paso shooting, Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Ohio shootings as the shooter was a Warren follower.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN I fixed your tweet: "Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù I hope Fox news outlets will report this Fake News as if it were true. Thank you!"
C: (0.988%) T: @BrentMcCay I will SHOUT it to the world. I donated to Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/cFsN2ur4qP
