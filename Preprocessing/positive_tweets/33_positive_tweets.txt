C: (1.000%) T: @JamesFourM Now make the connection between being leftist and murdering your sister. Antifa retweeters murder family members? Saying he was for gun reform and then going on a murder rampage? Wanting to vote for Elizabeth Warren and hating women? Connect those dots for me please.
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC  what about the Ohio shooter.    He was a left wing but job,   he was for socialism the green New Deal and he was for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  There is hate on both sides and the hate needs to stop by both sides.   We all need to come together as the Americans
C: (1.000%) T: @johniadarola Bernie Sanders. Not the same as Elizabeth Warren. Terrell your buddy cenk trust WE feel this way and shall continue to despite his clearly #neoliberal protestations!
C: (1.000%) T: @RealKyleMorris @AndrewPollackFL @ewarren  The Dayton shooter hated Trump, supported Antifa, and liked Elizabeth Warren.  He couldn't stand the right.  I'm so tired of politicians blaming everything on the right.  This was an angry white leftist this time.  Get your facts straight Ms. Warren!!
C: (0.990%) T: @DemGovs Just remember,   El Paso shooter was pissed off from watching the Dem debate Ohio shooter was a follower of Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @Jeff_MFT @washingtonpost Thank you  I'm a Democrat (like, Elizabeth Warren fan level Democrat) and loathe Trump and all he and the modern GOP stand for  But I've been so disheartened tonight reading the excuses made by my 'side' for this  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò¢
C: (0.987%) T: @KamalaHarris Shot by a registered Democrat who supported Elizabeth Warren. Disgusting.
C: (0.983%) T: @SenWarren if @realDonaldTrump is responsible for the El Paso shooting, than you are responsible for the Dayton, Oh shooting, @BernieSanders is responsible for the shooting @SteveScalise,  https://t.co/yFEleDegXO #FoxNews
C: (1.000%) T: Victor Davis Hanson is brilliant.  If white privelege is so real, why didn't Elizabeth Warren fake being Scandinavian instead of Indian or why doesn't Beto O'rourke go by the name Fritz O'rourke.
C: (1.000%) T: @ZerlinaMaxwell Was invited to see Kamala Harris on Saturday in my city. Supporting Elizabeth Warren by donating. Had a long talk with dear friend on racism and our history of not understanding as much as we thought.
C: (1.000%) T: @WISH_TV So where is the reporting on the Dayton shooter being an Elizabeth warren supporter?  He had very strong left-leaning language on his twitter account?  Seriously why is every Indianapolis station so freaking biased?  PS I didn‚Äôt vote for trump but news should be unbiased.
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib One was a leftist, Antifa, satanist who unsurprisingly supports Elizabeth warren #ElizabethWarren2020hasthesatanistvote
C: (0.554%) T: @PistolVanBuren Truth over facts?OMG!Let him speak, he is his worst enemy.And this idiot will defeat DT? Forget his stupidity ,look at his record.DT Will clean the floor with JB. The same goes for Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and all of the centrist dems. Only Bernie or Tulsi will defeat him.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist ‚Äî and does ‚Äòeverything he can to stir up hatred‚Äô - https://t.co/8RpuRiZJPR
C: (1.000%) T: @rezaaslan @marcthiessen I'd have to agree with @marcthiessen on this one. The Intel shows he was a believer in extreme violent group ANTIFA, and followed Indiana Jones Aka Elizabeth Warren. So using that logic in El Paso works for Ohio as well.
C: (0.995%) T: Today someone asked me if I‚Äôd vote for Elizabeth Warren, even under distress. I said no. https://t.co/meoAWlPPqs
C: (0.702%) T: @JGilliam_SEAL @fgcallari @Luarien @Ardamora @ewarren Wow this guy doesn't care about Elizabeth Warren so much he replied to her tweet AND got into an argument about it.
C: (1.000%) T: I wish I was a US citizen for the sole reason that I would vote for Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @haskedahyiitihi yes lol i think im gunna be joe rogan for halloween, elizabeth warren or a slutty american flag.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren That is really amazing because today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was an idiot and I said yes!
C: (1.000%) T: @fendiadlib np!!! here's another one on elizabeth warren and some of her policies + why you should really take into consideration who to vote for instead of basing it off who "feels" like the best choice. the first article i sent is lengthy but well worth the read. https://t.co/DkMr54q03q
C: (1.000%) T: My old Dry Cleaner was sexist.  My new one has a picture of Obama on the wall  I used to drink Yuengling, then I found out they‚Äôre big Trump supporters. Now I drink Yards, they hosted Elizabeth Warren in Philly  I‚Äôm putting my money where my values are
C: (0.987%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if I supported Elizabeth Warren. I said HELL YES!
C: (0.526%) T: @TimHannan So.. Did Elizabeth Warren or wack jobs like you cause the Dayton Antifa shooter to kill? You are what is wrong with the LEFT.
C: (1.000%) T: Both Elizabeth Warren and the UK government advocate for the break up of big-tech companies. But the IMF thinks the concentration of market power goes beyond digital. Find out the whole debate in Konstantinos Efstathiou's blog &gt;&gt;https://t.co/vFxulV1PuG https://t.co/1YMq0tczGh
