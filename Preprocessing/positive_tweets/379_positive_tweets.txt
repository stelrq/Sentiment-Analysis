C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to choose between a green military and an effective one,‚Äù üôÑhttps://t.co/uGatTaothx
C: (1.000%) T: @sairasameerarao You know, when you say "ALL" you're being just as divisive as Trump! Where do you come off saying "white skin makes white ppl like Trump"? Is Elizabeth Warren like Trump too?? And btw, Trump isn't white..he's ORANGE!!

C: (1.000%) T: My answer to How was Elizabeth Warren able to recover from the ancestry scandal and maintain a strong standing within the early 2020 Democratic Primary? https://t.co/JYL1P7355X
C: (1.000%) T: In @thenation, @toddntucker takes a closer look at #TradeOnOurTerms from @ewarren and how it comes at a time when plans to support workers and policies that examine power dynamics are much needed. https://t.co/PbYSAJAOYu
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN "I won't politicize the Dayton massacre by mentioning the shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren.  Some people would, but I won't blame Elizabeth Warren, who inspired the shooter. We can't play politics like saying Elizabeth. Warren.  Dayton. Shooter. "
C: (1.000%) T: @morganarae The HRC website was still up last I checked&amp; has all of her policy plans. Elizabeth Warren went shopping on Clinton‚Äôs website last weekend. Which is fine! HRC had best plans. But damn, give props to the brilliant wonk who originally created the plans. She‚Äôs acting like Bernie.
C: (1.000%) T: Some of Elizabeth Warren's many touted plans are actually not good when you examine them, but public broadband access for all and eliminating Internet providers?? Oh baby that's some good shit right there....

C: (1.000%) T: @bennyjohnson @Twitter Why is it that Elizabeth Warren's name is showing up in a lot of these recent incidents?
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ How low can you get? You think something Elizabeth Warren suggested or encouraged him to kill his own sister and her boyfriend, a man of color? Seriously? Because the El Paso shooter was clearly acting in accordance with Trump's rhetoric.
C: (0.997%) T: @robreiner Stop over dramatizing the con who stole 2016 and get out and help me make our election convictions. Cocaine trafficking for congress requires adjudication with Elizabeth Warren. Gold and Money Back delivered then. https://t.co/S0qJ7tlbwq
C: (1.000%) T: @RAICESTEXAS Are you seriously linking and blaming Tucker Carlson for the mass murder of Americans? What about the people who actually did these things? Don‚Äôt forget the Dayton shooter was a hardcore liberal who intended to vote for Elizabeth Warren? Shift the blame to the right people
C: (1.000%) T: @aaronjewert @USATODAY The same day IN Dayton  Ohio a Democrat Elizabeth warren supporter killed 9 people is that white nationalism?
C: (0.555%) T: So here we go if you haven't looked at it yet Elizabeth Warren released her gun control plan. It is an absolute nightmare. Nothing but executive actions banning guns raising taxes and Larry gun manufacturers be sued because people do bad things with a product.
C: (0.988%) T: So are people who support Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/psjY8KeDDT
