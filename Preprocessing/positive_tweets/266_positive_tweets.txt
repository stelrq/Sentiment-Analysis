C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps Oh, goodness.  I'm going to assume this guy was a Trump supporter, partly because he doesn't like Elizabeth Warren, and partly because he actually verbally insulted someone's looks because he thought they LOOKED like someone he didn't like.  Yikes.

C: (1.000%) T: @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump Both were crackpots. Crazy. The San Antonio killer even said President Trump was not an inspiration. Environmental and green new deal supporter. The  Ohio killer was a big socialist love Bernie Sanders ,Elizabeth Warren a antifa soldier
C: (1.000%) T: @KerseyTony @Estashaniel @ewarren Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter Friday that Michael Brown was ‚Äúmurdered‚Äù by a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù policeman in Ferguson, Mo. This is an absolute whopper and obviously does nothing to calm racial tension in this country. Yet it‚Äôs gotten almost no coverage
C: (1.000%) T: @PaulLeeTicks @RealCandaceO Funny you didn't mention the Elizabeth Warren supporter that shot a bunch of African Americans in Ohio, but I understand he doesn't meet your narrative or agenda, so sit and wait all you want.
C: (0.552%) T: Hot-take: Elizabeth Warren is going to win the Iowa Caucus
C: (0.957%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth warren the next president mega agenda will be the HOMELESS ELDERLY  DISABLED AMERICANS  gun control Medicare for all and FREE DENTAL CARE FOR ALL
C: (0.996%) T: @TheWriteJennyG Thanks for your question, Jenny. I'm pulling some cards now. Two fell out of the deck, the same as in Elizabeth Warren's reading. I will post the details soon.
C: (1.000%) T: @RealKidPoker Elizabeth Warren is smart, likes to read and write books.  Not crapping on Yang, but he's not unique
C: (0.828%) T: @MaxBoot @DrewFromTV Are you even serious? Would you rather have sleepy Joe or crazy Bernie, or raving Elizabeth Warren? Of course you would, because you're a leftist idiot!
C: (0.501%) T: Raising taxes on gun manufacturers is just the beginning. Just wait. Elizabeth Warren scares me üò±. https://t.co/BUTWJ9l9bd
C: (1.000%) T: I'm fond of Joe Biden,really like Elizabeth Warren Bernie,Corey Booker,All-But am really liking the way other 'youngsters 'Pete Buttegeid, Tim Ryan&amp;Corey Booker are talking,they want to go tough:O'Rourke joins list of supporters of federal gun licensing https://t.co/oyOOSM8b1s
C: (1.000%) T: @OnlyHearSeeHate @CNN @Scaramucci Biden needs to take it like a man and I believe he is. However, as much as I like Biden, I think Julian Castro and Pete Buttigieg will make better presidents than Biden. My number on that list right now though is Elizabeth Warren. She is definitely for the people.
C: (1.000%) T: She chose Kamala Harris, which is why I, as a PROGRESSIVE, do not choose Harris. Elizabeth Warren please.  ‚ÄòLifelong conservatives‚Äô at Iowa State Fair flip to Dems: Trump‚Äôs presidency is ‚Äòabsolutely disgusting‚Äô - https://t.co/sdAeeFrDYI

C: (1.000%) T: Warren sounds like she was a great teacher but I‚Äôve extremely complicated feelings about electing another professor-president. https://t.co/5g4yz7btJq
C: (0.594%) T: @Lrihendry @ewarren SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN D-MA,with all due respect you are the racist fanning the flames of the black community. Michael Brown was shot because he was attacking Officer Wilson. The Obama DOJ cleared Officer Wilson, but the community still demagaughed him for shooting this thug.
C: (1.000%) T: Let's not forget the one of the shooters was Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporters Democrats they don't say that in the news or the media anywhere but when they say something about Trump it's all over the media you guys are so full of shit
C: (0.995%) T: @prof_mirya  even if she's a woman Can Elizabeth Warren Win It All? https://t.co/P0uazXQv9y

C: (1.000%) T: @JimmyPrinceton @DiannyRants Dude has a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome, and it's only a matter of time until he endorses Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @LeahNTorres Now do those who support Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris, in light of their recent comments about Darren Wilson.
C: (0.706%) T: @brobert545 Elizabeth Warren will NEVER be President.  Despite the never ending love she gets from the propaganda media.
