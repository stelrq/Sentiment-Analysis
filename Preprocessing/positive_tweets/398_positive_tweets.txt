C: (0.999%) T: @MSNBC Watching #AndreaMitchellReports and I have not heard you say that Dayton, Ohio evil was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren and his tweets pre-dated President Trump. Neither Warren or the President are responsible. #WashingtonExaminer
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC @oufenix PROUD as all heck to support Elizabeth Warren. I even wear a shirt that has her name on it. GASP! Why would I be embarrassed about this?

C: (0.733%) T: @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @OANN Seriously, you claim you're not a racist in the same statement you call Elizabeth Warren "Pocahontas". Sit down, shut the fuck up, and let the adults talk, you dumb, dumb, cunt.

C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Not true but you already know that. When leftists don‚Äôt like the truth, they lie. Which means they only lie when their lips are moving. The Dayton shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren and Antifa. Both shootings were hateful and despicable. Doesn‚Äôt matter the ideology.

C: (1.000%) T: As he prepared to visit Dayton Wednesday, President Donald Trump denied his rhetoric has emboldened white nationalists and inspired anger, noting that the Ohio gunman favored the presidential candidacies of Democrats Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/qzz60cpBtE
C: (0.669%) T: @CNN You want to blame Trump for dayton Ohio? Well we all blame CNN and Elizabeth Warren for el paso. Both shootings were staged to get rid of the 2nd amendment. Why the 4 guys dressed In black?

C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 President Trump is not responsible any more than Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooting. Get help for your TDS!
C: (0.986%) T: I can guarantee Elizabeth Warren likes the Cha Cha slide.
C: (1.000%) T: @CNNPolitics Trump is a white supremacist like Elizabeth Warren  is Indian, a honest politician, and never lies.  CNN uses that term for Trump and most whites around  a thousand times a day.  I am so sick of it as is most of America.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Also Elizabeth Warren ‚ÄúI was asked whether I should receive benefit for an ethnicity I do not belong to. I said yes.‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: Another clarification on who Elizabeth Warren really is. Does anybody believe she will fight for single payer, or anything else for that matter. These NPR nerds who support her are literally the stupidest people on the planet https://t.co/H2OpEBcg0A
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren What a crazy coincidence that a reporter who is assigned to cover Elizabeth Warren just happened to bump into her while she was buying lemonade.
C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 For a "doctor" you sure don't seem very smart. Are you even aware that this psycho was an avowed Socialist who attended Antifa uprisings and hated Trump/loved Elizabeth Warren? Doesn't sound like a Trump follower to me. But carry on üôÑThis is the very reason he'll be re-elected.
