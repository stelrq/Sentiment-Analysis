C: (0.995%) T: @iamcardib  you do know that Elizabeth Warren is a Liberal don't you?
C: (1.000%) T: @faroutmadman @trreal @Mathis35535447 @stitchergirl32 The Dayton shooter was a leftist Elizabeth Warren supporters. That means she’s responsible for their deaths, right? Bernie Sanders is responsible for the congressional baseball practice shooting, yeah?
C: (0.984%) T: @WayneDupreeShow The Dayton killer was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  So, why is this liberal democratic mayor blaming President Trump?
C: (0.985%) T: Fox News and Trump followers are trying to compare the terrorist in Dayton &amp; his connection to Elizabeth Warren to the terrorist in El Paso &amp; Trump. Warren is not a white nationalist, she never said "send them back" or "build the Wall". Trump did.

C: (0.503%) T: @realDonaldTrump Yes, it will be, when he, or hopefully Elizabeth Warren, smiles as you slink out of the White House and into a jail cell.
C: (0.980%) T: Elizabeth Warren Compared Abortion to “Getting Your Tonsils Out”. Never saw a tonsil grow up to be a senator... Too bad her parents didn't feel the same way.  https://t.co/YrndYO9jnl
C: (1.000%) T: @hxhassan Can't believe that Elizabeth Warren said in the debate that the Dayton shooter's sister and random people in a bar were invading the US and spent years demonizing them and also joked about shooting them and also sent the military to Dayton.
C: (1.000%) T: @daniel672245 @GaustadStephen @charliekirk11 @ewarren I want you to type out that you think this guy murdered his sister and a bunch of random people because of Elizabeth Warren.

C: (0.994%) T: @BillKristol Lol @ Elizabeth Warren... is she some sort of punishment?
C: (1.000%) T: @RoArquette Just declare yourself black or native like Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.778%) T: @CNN Fact check: people blame Trump for inciting violence in people like the Dayton killer Facts first: the killer was obsessed with Elizabeth warren and the democrats and didn’t like Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: Be real with you, Elizabeth Warren is the best candidate for presidency, but the big wigs of this world don’t care about morals so watch they do everything in they power to keep her out.
C: (1.000%) T: @dwagbunT @GhostNationUnit @LucasStClair3 @BernieSanders Bernie Sanders, Kampala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and the rest of the candidates. It is a lie. Taxing the rich to death won’t provide enough free stuff. Also it will trigger the exodus of American capital. So who will give you all the “free stuff “

C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Hey fat ass, it wasn't in the name of "white supremecy", the shooters were registered democrats and one supported Elizabeth Warren.  Check your facts before opening your fat mouth.
C: (0.988%) T: Big fan of Warren’s plan to stop states from restricting municipal broadband, then creating “an $85-billion federal grant program to shoulder 90% of the costs for utility cooperatives, nonprofits, cities, counties and Native American tribes” https://t.co/gHQVdAL9Ts
C: (0.998%) T: @EmmaVigeland @ewarren Emma has sold the American people out by constantly pushing Elizabeth Warren as if Warren is actually a fucking progressive. Seriously Emma..Fucking stop it. Warren has taken the always corrupting money(no exceptions) and she is a lying hypocrite.  https://t.co/sMWcoavcJ2
C: (1.000%) T: Me: “I really don’t know that much about politics”  Me after two beers: “here’s the list of who’s running for president and why Elizabeth warren is the clear choice”
