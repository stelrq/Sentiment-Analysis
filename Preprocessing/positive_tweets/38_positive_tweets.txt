C: (1.000%) T: Something to watch for @betonline_ag ‚Äî Elizabeth Warren is now not too far off as the favorite to be Democrat nominee at +350.    Also, Tulsi Gabbard has had a big jump going from +5000 entering the first debate to +2000.  Good underdog bet  https://t.co/rxwNSJOTTK

C: (1.000%) T: THANK YOU for setting them straight! President Trump: "The Dayton situation, he was a fan of Antifa. He was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Nothing to do with Trump, but nobody ever mentions that."  https://t.co/xz20819z0s
C: (0.987%) T: Kirsten Gillibrand &amp; Elizabeth Warren released investment plans, but KG was Conservative, so her motives are more suspicious, Republicans or Reactionaries profitting wealthy before us,...

C: (1.000%) T: @jones_digby @DanODonnellShow @CharlesMBlow The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter who urged people to vote Democrat.  You call that ‚Äúwhite supremacist terrorism‚Äù? Wow.
C: (1.000%) T: Everyone should pay attention to the @ewarren proposal for guaranteed high-speed internet access. These are the kinds of policies that will truly help Americans. https://t.co/eBnfKhi1Bs

C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris You and Elizabeth Warren are responsible for the deaths of those innocent lives in Dayton. Your antagonistic race baiting behavior caused this!

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren bakes a strawberry shortcake and now this! I just want to know that they‚Äôll lead the nation with integrity and protect the constitution. https://t.co/ou8E4nazLd
C: (1.000%) T: In Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs America, this equals one serving of strawberry shortcake. And that‚Äôs the exact sort of policy that may actually win over some of my old man‚Äôs high school buddies TBH. https://t.co/A1F8sAFBkl
C: (1.000%) T: In light of Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren trying to ignite a hailstorm again regarding Ferguson, Missouri. One that from my understanding was settled and investigated  thoroughly by the Obama Administration and DOJ. https://t.co/2Aj7sWN41H
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Um, I think you‚Äôre awesome Elizabeth warren but it‚Äôs not really strawberry season. That‚Äôs June. Where are you that it‚Äôs strawberry season? Also respectfully that looks nothing like strawberry shortcake

C: (1.000%) T: Guess who is NOT involved in all this ‚ÄúEpstein business‚Äù: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and even Barack Obama üòÉ
C: (1.000%) T: @CheriJacobus Elizabeth Warren did a pretty good one.   1: Russia interfered in our 2016 election.  2: Then candidate trump welcomed and encouraged this interference.  3: President trump then, on multiple occasions, attempted to obstruct an investigation of Russia's actions.
C: (1.000%) T: What's happening is that I want and I expect Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Kochbaur, Beto O'Rourke, Julian Castro, Cory Booker, to step up against this reprehensible action.
C: (1.000%) T: @MfromPa @billmaher Yup. And don't forget he fucks Ann Coulter. There isn't enough weed in the world to excuse that. He really ripped into Elizabeth Warren and though I am not yet backing her, he had no right to do that to a Dem.
C: (1.000%) T: I love Elizabeth Warren more than most people I know in real life. However, I‚Äôm trying to imagine @PaulHollywood, @PrueLeith and Mary‚Äôs reaction to this cake and... I don‚Äôt know what to do. https://t.co/FmXHC6n920
