C: (1.000%) T: @design__hole This is a really interesting comment and one I feel people like Elizabeth Warren are missing. Hillary Clinton had amazing policy and plans detailed in her platform that most ignored. Some chose not to vote and some went for the big bang cult figure that made them feel empowered.
C: (1.000%) T: 'Hi, I'm Elizabeth Warren and I believe in taking away the rights of women and minorities because a couple of white dudes ruined it for everybody.' https://t.co/OsdPXAeTMs
C: (1.000%) T: @AuskarSurbakti @SenWarren @jaketapper @HillaryClinton @SenSanders This is a Doctored Video in an attempt to dissuade voters from supporting Elizabeth Warren &amp; NOT Non Democrat Bernie Sanders.  Voters are not that Dumb!  This was an obvious Doctored Video.  @ZerlinaMaxwell @Lawrence @jaketapper @DanaBashCNN @JoyAnnReid @neeratanden @wolfblitzer https://t.co/YIHY4JxBxL
C: (1.000%) T: @stillgray @gatewaypundit Executive branch is different. Trump can deny someone due process. Elizabeth Warren can't!
C: (1.000%) T: Is it really fair to consider Elizabeth Warren a "policy" candidate if every policy proposal revolves around tax increases? Just asking. https://t.co/LzdyNYo39d
C: (1.000%) T: @CongBoyle The El Paso shooter was a left-wing registered Democrat. The Dayton shooter supported gun control and Elizabeth Warren.  We should be controlling the Democrats who seem to always be behind these shootings. Perhaps this is intentional.
C: (1.000%) T: @QueenInYeIIow It's sad how one has to go through so much shit to run for President. Especially when that one person sacrificed her career in the DNC, made enemies w/ the Clintons, DNC, and establishment, to endorse Bernie when little opportunist Elizabeth WARren did not.
C: (1.000%) T: @dotcommodity @RayCornball @joemamma_1 What about crazy shooters that support &amp; echo the left?   By your "standard"  Elizabeth Warren is now evil (Dayton), and so is Bernie (Scalise shooting).   This good vs evil thing is another delusional lib idea of a strategy, and will be a complete fail.  Easy Trump 2020 win!
C: (1.000%) T: I thought Kamala Harris had the best chance to be the Democratic nominee but she is floundering and Elizabeth Warren is doing better and better
C: (0.987%) T: They LIE! Brit Hume slams media for ignoring â€˜absolute whopper of a storyâ€™ about Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris https://t.co/sf3kQGFDXn via @twitchyteam
C: (0.723%) T: This sure beats ANTIFA, the mis-guided &amp; lost. CNN &amp; NBC are Communists.  The Chinese Government Supports the American Main Stream Media, who marches in goose-step with Elizabeth Warren &amp; Joe "lost in the woods" Biden. https://t.co/QLLmGKWP4p
C: (0.997%) T: @SaraCarterDC @vegasrenae @Overstock @FBI @HillaryClinton Looks like a male ELIZABETH WARREN!
C: (1.000%) T: @MarcusEdelstein @cindylouwho1127 To be clear, prefer Elizabeth Warren at this point but will vote for any of the Dems running (except Tulsi Gabbard). Whether theyâ€™re alive or dead.
C: (0.997%) T: @aimeeterese Elizabeth Warren, a person of colour  ful cardigans.
C: (0.986%) T: Elizabeth Warren will reduce gun and ammunition sales by slapping a tax on gun manufacturers https://t.co/DI8Zc0xfjH #aag
C: (0.523%) T: @aimeeterese I still laugh everytime I hear a Liberal say Bernie is racist and doesn't understand the threat of white supremacy then they defend Elizabeth Warren based on her calling Trump a white supremacist. Like, Fucking hell lol
C: (1.000%) T: @zeefa64 If that were true,which it is not according to Zerobamaâ€™s Justice Department, why is Elizabeth Warren just now getting around to caring?
C: (1.000%) T: Really important read  https://t.co/2ObhFqe0iU
C: (1.000%) T: @dan_geldon @ewarren Iâ€™m starting to lean towards Elizabeth Warren. Given the current slate of candidates so that can change but for now, I agree with some stances.
C: (1.000%) T: @MadAddictSport @littlecarrotq @BabeReflex_8 @realDonaldTrump (1) ACORN .... and we have DEMOS org ðŸ‘£ðŸ‘£ðŸ‘£ Co-founder was Elizabeth WARRENâ€™s Daughter &amp; Hussein Obama was on the Founding Board in yr. 2000ðŸš¨ Which leads to TOM PEREZ, the DNC Chairman (reply tweet is a thread w/ more info) https://t.co/V1WYbe6XBR
C: (0.987%) T: @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren is calling for the same thing.
C: (1.000%) T: @peterdaou @BernieSanders @ewarren Peter, why did you go and ruin a great tweet by adding the #TrumpDemocrat Elizabeth Warren? We couldn't count on her in 2016 to get it right and we can't trust her now. She and her neolibs will give us 4 more years of Trump. https://t.co/d1bq4z7Xbw
C: (1.000%) T: I need Elizabeth warren to sweep the nation so the votes will be unanimous and it wonâ€™t be like 40% trump 30% Bernie and 30% warren. You know what I mean?
C: (0.995%) T: @BusyPhilipps Tell Your Mom she is probably just as Beautiful as Elizabeth Warren or mayhap even more Beautiful than Her.
C: (0.973%) T: @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris @ewarren @SenWarren  Both of you owe Ferguson police a public apology!!!! You knew the Obama administion cleared this case you knew and you lied - you drugs Browns family through the pain again https://t.co/fqinTuIFuj
