C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders Step down from the race, Bernie. Allow your votes to go to Elizabeth Warren and let's make this a real race. You may be a misogynist, but you are not stupid. You know that your presence is splitting her votes.
C: (1.000%) T: @lufrewoptoo @arlo120 His twitter account apparently had links to ANTIFA and Elizabeth Warren. Sorry
C: (1.000%) T: @VABVOX If think Tulsi Gabbard is running to take down Kamala Harris, then Elizabeth Warren. She is not a team player.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to exterminate white male, gun owning Trump voters! Oops I apologize. I misspoke. — I meant to say Warren wants to be friends with Trump voters and simply disagrees with their America First policies. My bad! https://t.co/5fDePBZ4wF
C: (0.987%) T: Finally she admits the truth that she is “hopping mad.” Accurate description.  #poorGeorge  Kelly Anne Conway is ‘hopping mad’ that Elizabeth Warren isn’t being blamed for the Dayton shooting https://t.co/HkwKCGcB3U
C: (1.000%) T: @ksdknews @realDonaldTrump had NOTHING to do with these mass shootings. Nobody blamed Obama for the 24 shootings that occurred during his watch. Why no mention of the Dayton shooter’s love of Antifa, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders?
C: (0.546%) T: @ABC Let’s not forget that the Ohio shooter described him supper is a leftist who liked  Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: I just wanna say if you're upset with Donald please don't vote for Kamala Harris she isn't a presidential Dem please consider Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @politico Oh good heavenly days, can you even imagine the emptiness of the heads supposedly being turned by Elizabeth Warren? A woman who recreates herself as needed on a daily basis? People who have no concept of what it’s like to listen to somebody able to tell the truth. LOL YeGods!
C: (1.000%) T: @shaunking @realDonaldTrump Shaun, he did not. Did Elizabeth warren cause the Dayton shooting?
C: (1.000%) T: @BreitbartNews Why do you call your self a Republican?  Why as elizabeth warren denouncing the Dayton shooter because he supported her and bernie madoff Sanders.
C: (0.995%) T: So the Dayton shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren. What conclusion should we draw??
