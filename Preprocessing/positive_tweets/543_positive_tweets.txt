C: (0.987%) T: @felicianista @beadragonne @mattyglesias @JulianCastro Uh, Trump’s “White Sumpremacist” campaign? Come on. Who’s donating to Elizabeth Warren and Sanders’ Communist campaigns? The Dayton shooter supported them.
C: (1.000%) T: Picture of Elizabeth Warren supporting lemonade stand capitalists brings with it some hilarious replies https://t.co/sdxOIJ7Bzu
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren unveils $85 billion proposal &lt;br&gt;to guarantee high-speed internet access https://t.co/dSjqcwlopV... Shades of the mega failured CA. super high speed railway .. HAhahaaabahahahahahaha
C: (1.000%) T: @maggieNYT @jmartNYT @ewarren It's fascinating to see corporate media folks latch on so desperately this afternoon to Elizabeth Warren liking the word "porch."  If she had chosen some cool esoteric word, their narrative would be "Warren is too wonky for real Americans" instead of "she's just like Romney!"
C: (1.000%) T: @mgrant76308 @DonBrown54 @BetteMidler regardless of the fact that one of the shooters hates Trump as much as BM does and is a bernie sanders/elizabeth warren supporter?? See how stupid these over privileged Hollywood left Wing nut jobs are? Living in their own reality.
C: (1.000%) T: @tomwatson I really like Elizabeth Warren. But I have a very hard time forgiving her for not endorsing Bernie Sanders in 2016. Especially in light of the fact that she's running as an almost carbon copy of him this time around.
C: (1.000%) T: "Then I started to come around: ACTUALLY, Elizabeth Warren paying $10 for lemonade is praxis. She’s redistributing wealth!" https://t.co/KNQzqPyEll
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/8Lpd1SE2BO
C: (1.000%) T: @LarrysIdeas @benshapiro Neither Ben Shapiro nor I said porch was our favorite word. But, evidently Elizabeth Warren did.
C: (1.000%) T: Analysis | Elizabeth Warren is surging. This one big question looms over her. - Electability? Are we looking for a candidate that knows what's going on &amp; is looking for ways to solve problems? Or are we looking for a white man to be the Great White Hope?  https://t.co/mY5PiiEYaF
C: (0.987%) T: @BetteMidler He didn't tell them to shoot anyone. You forget the Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan so are you blaming her for those shootings?  Get a grip Bette
C: (0.671%) T: @ewarren The #daytonshooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter..  so the victims' blood must be on her hands..
C: (1.000%) T: @BrentMcCay No.  I’m proud to support Elizabeth Warren.  Deep down inside, Trump supporters know he a a piece of shit.  That’s why they’re embarrassed to admit they support Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: When the people that run campaigns either support the candidate or give the candidate serious props, that says something. That says a lot. https://t.co/ahoO7TzyL9
C: (0.987%) T: @thesingularnick @bennyjohnson @trumps_feed I didn't blame mental health. You're trying to hold a person accountable for the actions of another. Why aren't you holding Bernie and Elizabeth Warren accountable? Words are subjective. You don't get to decide whose words don't matter.
C: (0.526%) T: @SenWarren @WhipClyburn And who's been in Washington? Elizabeth Warren? But now your going to fix it?  Right smh
C: (0.983%) T: @realDailyWire This is a political stunt. They have no case. But it is refreshing to see that they are getting nervous about Elizabeth Warren... #Warren2020 #YesWePlan
C: (1.000%) T: @DVaughan70 Yes!😂😂😂😂😂👍.  I almost used one with Elizabeth Warren.😂😂😂
C: (1.000%) T: The front-runner in the early polls of Democrats in Nevada and the nation — Biden — isn’t singled out for having a top campaign, in part because he started so late relative to the others https://t.co/fgjrT9KO3c
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren just casually paring my teaching philosophy down to two crisp sentences: “I don’t get up and teach to show how smart I am. I get up and teach to show how smart you are, to help you have the power and the tools so that you can build what you want to build.”
C: (1.000%) T: Its extremely frustrating that an Elizabeth Warren/Sherrod Brown ticket is a huge winner for the Dems and we can’t have it because winning the Presidency means nothing if we don’t have 51 votes in the Senate.
C: (1.000%) T: @gtconway3d What about the Dayton shooter who was pro left pro antifa pro Elizabeth Warren? Doesn't fit you're narrative so let's not talk about it right?
C: (1.000%) T: There are ways to reform the private equity business without killing it off  https://t.co/wTIKuRDGss
C: (1.000%) T: @BrentMcCay I donate to Elizabeth Warren. As a matter of fact, I’ll go donate more now.
C: (1.000%) T: @jchaltiwanger Keep repeating that to yourself in your echo chamber; the Dayton shooter supported Antifa and Elizabeth Warren but we're not supposed to acknowledge that I guess.
