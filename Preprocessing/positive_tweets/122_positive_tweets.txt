C: (1.000%) T: @SenSherrodBrown So to all of you making these comments, if this President does something about gun laws, will you actually give him or the republicans credit for doing the right thing. Including you Senator? Will you denounce ANTIFA Or Elizabeth Warren or Sanders?

C: (0.994%) T: @christinajoy67 @MZHemingway In Britain the journalism has been so lazy that they haven't even bothered to separate the two attacks but have just said they were both committed by white supremacists. It's only via Twitter I found out the Dayton killer had pronouns in his bio and supported Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden Quit fanning the flames by calling Trump a white supremacist. Not true.  Then what will you call Elizabeth Warren, Burnie Sanders and Antifa since the Dayton OH shooter was referring to THEM?  You are hypocritical....
C: (0.991%) T: @JoeNBC I donated to both Elizabeth Warren &amp; Joe Biden and I‚Äôm OK with anyone knowing that.
C: (0.995%) T: How do you not love what Elizabeth Warren wants to do for our nation? https://t.co/Nq4ti95C8O
C: (1.000%) T: @toryshulman The Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Speak about this!!!
C: (0.526%) T: Warren pledges to restore net neutrality if elected https://t.co/Lzx4hFibCg
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden Just like Obama. A do nothing, know nothing, empty suit politician. Blaming Trump for the El Paso shooting and passing on the Ohio radical Elizabeth Warren supporting democratic shooter. No one is to name for either but the shooters. Incredibly ignorant !!

C: (1.000%) T: As BLP has previously reported, Connor Betts had previously advocated for socialism, Elizabeth Warren, satanism, and the recent firebombing of an ICE facility by an Antifa extremist. He had also interacted with many of the leading left-wing figures... https://t.co/DCgU7QrEC5

C: (1.000%) T: @DaytimeDan @blankslate2017 @timjacobwise Also, Biden is easy to see as the comforter-in-chief and as the moral face of the country to the rest of the world.  Harder to see that in someone as indignant as Elizabeth Warren ‚Äî let alone a curmudgeon constantly uttering diatribes like Bernie Sanders in these roles.
C: (0.987%) T: @meganmesserly This makes up for the minimal coverage on Elizabeth Warren in your article yesterday.
C: (0.989%) T: @TheHarryCherry Dude was not Antifa, he was some asshole who thought it was a ‚Äúleftist‚Äù even though he supported Elizabeth Warren.  If someone told me they were the reincarnation of Czar Nicholas II it doesn‚Äôt mean they are.

C: (0.987%) T: @Nadomom @redsteeze @BillMillerBarBQ Seriously? Are you going to say the same for Bernie we had a supporter shoot congressmen at Baseball practice? Or Elizabeth Warren who had her supporter kill people at the club in Dayton day after El Paso?????
C: (1.000%) T: @gtconway3d Looks like Trump crushes up Adderall and snorts it so he can use nicknames like "Low Energy Jeb" and "Sleepy Joe". I think "Steady Hand Joe" is more appropriate. And Elizabeth Warren has plans, while Trump has nicknames.
C: (1.000%) T: @rezaaslan Here's a photo of the Washington Post story. Because I haven't figured out how to get the link off of parler.  So go ahead and keep calling him right wing but the reality is, he was antifa. He was Elizabeth Warren's baby. https://t.co/ZAuKa544yF
C: (1.000%) T: Mike - you succeeded because corporate power was weak and competition fostered. That‚Äôs what Elizabeth Warren wants more of. If you care enough about markets working then you‚Äôd give her all your money so she can win and Dems can win the senate https://t.co/2KrajMyMjE
