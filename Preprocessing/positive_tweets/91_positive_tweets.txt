C: (0.529%) T: @ConnieSchultz @marcthiessen @PostOpinions Where has Elizabeth Warren ever incited violence?  It‚Äôs an absurd comparison. We have court filings citing the ‚ÄúPOTUS told me to do it‚Äù defense.  The El Paso murderer is likely to use the same.  This issue is too important to cheapen. History will not be kind to these enablers.

C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren: Is an Indian? Will ever be President? Is sane?  I said: No No And No
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren, a white liberal Democrat who spent years lying about being a Native American Indian, expects us to believe her when she claims the president is a white supremacist.   Well Liz, I think you might be a pathological liar. https://t.co/n8ccPQWkGF
C: (0.986%) T: Elizabeth Warren,  You said ‚Äúyes‚Äù because you are a race-baiter.  You, um, lady, are a White Suprematist! https://t.co/EarA0Ll8wu
C: (1.000%) T: This President has done more to help the blacks and hispanics that any other President.  These people cannot point to a specific thing that he has said or done that is racist!  At least he did... https://t.co/T4t43DG8Cn
C: (1.000%) T: @JillRTeamXRP @ChuckCallesto Did you see how fast the media changed the narrative from ‚Äúmessages of hate, fueled by the right‚Äù to ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter what his motive was‚Äù when they found out he was an Elizabeth warren supporter, motivated by antifa...
C: (0.994%) T: This is unreal.                                                                     Today I asked whether Elizabeth Warren was a Native America. I said No, but she said YES for 30 years and apologized for lying the day she announced she was running for president. https://t.co/rKQERDZ1ab
C: (1.000%) T: OK I am going to start telling people I am Indian and not black anymore. I need to get some that casino money. It worked for Elizabeth Warren, why not me. Issa Blackfoot Indian.
C: (0.991%) T: Warren thought this would make for a campaign commercial but it turned out to be a school lesson   https://t.co/1u1Ac52lxA
C: (1.000%) T: but knowing people will run with it; his 'plan' clearly has worked; as I've heard several people say you cannot blame Trump for these shootings; and the guy from Dayton was for Elizabeth Warren! ..... society fooled ... mission accomplished
C: (1.000%) T: @tribelaw @lyskitsune Neither shooter was a Trump fan but liberals loooove blaming him for everything! The Dayton shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren and the domestic terrorist group #antifa. We must blame them for this shooting because it‚Äôs the standard
C: (1.000%) T: Today, I was asked if Eliz Warren was Cherokee. I said ‚Äúaccording to her, she is‚Äù. They corrected me. They said ‚ÄúDonald Trump said she wasn‚Äôt and made some kind of bet and a DNA test was given and ELIZABETH WARREN WAS A PROVEN LIAR WHILE THE DONALD WAS PROVEN TRUTHFUL &amp; CORRECT.‚Äù https://t.co/0jAmHbOTnF

C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/SAfKsWoECK
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that. It's a plan she stole from Bernie Sanders and watered down with means testing and qualifications, but it's a plan I guess. #NotMeUs
C: (1.000%) T: Overloaded with information regarding the Dayton shooter‚Äôs reasoning and motive more than likely leading directly to the doorsteps of Elizabeth Warren who‚Äôs obviously a democrat, of course the FBI can‚Äôt unlock it. https://t.co/TZfcEVa9xZ
C: (1.000%) T: @KieseLaymon You think this is it for him? Or will he bounce back?  I think he should go home and enjoy retirement. Let Elizabeth Warren take over. https://t.co/6c1jatO1n6
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisCuomo hi Mr. Cuomo, I have a great interest in our politics. Concerning universal healthcare coverage, all of our politicians bring up the fact that our nation is the only one that doesn‚Äôt provide healthcare universally, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren continuously 1/
C: (0.992%) T: @ewarren I was asked today if Elizabeth Warren was a liar. I said absolutely.!!!
C: (1.000%) T: You can't have it both ways Eric!  You either support the 2nd Amendment or you don't!  There is no in-between!  And who gets to decide who is crazy and mentally ill?  Do you want Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker or Joe Biden making this decision for you? https://t.co/ZaQAtPZWSo
C: (1.000%) T: Liberal idiots attacking Kid Rock forget that their beloved liberal leaders like Obama, Joe Biden, Bernie &amp; Elizabeth Warren all are rich elites with privileged upbringings who are hypocrites about it. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #DemocratsAreDangerous #DemocratsAreHypocrites
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if rick Reilly and Elizabeth warren we‚Äôre idiots , and I said yes
C: (0.993%) T: Let‚Äôs stop saying: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear‚Äù...you sound like Elizabeth Warren.. https://t.co/eDl9Xq6xO5
