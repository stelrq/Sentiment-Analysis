C: (1.000%) T: Without prompting, black lawmakers &amp; activists in SC, GA, FL, AL, MS &amp; LA all spoke favorably about Warren to me for this story about Biden https://t.co/fldfnuJXhn  And across NV, Warren is being raved about. That story here: https://t.co/SkkwGsjcom https://t.co/3qYDp3sbOu

C: (1.000%) T: @PressBeet My choice isn‚Äôt on this list. If you are really asking progressives, list Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard. Also, Bernie WILL be the nominee.

C: (0.984%) T: @RayAllenInMN No  the dayton shooter was an Elizabeth warren supporter and Antifa member  The el paso shooter was a leftist that hated Trump and was triggered when the Democrat candidates all supported free healthcare for illegals.
C: (1.000%) T: Two houses down from us, there‚Äôs a house with a massive ‚Äòtump 2020‚Äô sign (like, the whole width of their porch). I‚Äôm deciding how obnoxiously I want to display a rainbow and/or Elizabeth Warren sign
C: (1.000%) T: @Annie_c54 @HawleyMO @Castro4Congress @Twitter The Ohio shooter supports antifa and Elizabeth Warren. What responsibility does Warren and antifa bear for the Ohio shooter? What about pop culture glamorizing murderers like Quentin Tarantino's "Once upon a time in Hollywood" movie that depicts Charles Manson and his murder mob?

C: (0.947%) T: @Airmit106 @chrislongview Maybe you haven't noticed, but the GOP had spent the last few years packing that vilification in.  It is nasty, racist, and ready. Elizabeth Warren is not ready to counter the incoming racist attacks  Ahe invites them  She has not put in the work. People will suffer because of it

C: (1.000%) T: COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa ‚Äî Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Wednesday night that she believed President Trump was a white supremacist, broadly accusing him of dividing Americans along racial lines and providing direct and tacit support to  #E https://t.co/yEJLG0ZUGd
C: (1.000%) T: @TheProductDS 100%, but every time I think this, Elizabeth Warren comes out with an idea I get behind of. It's still a two person race for me

C: (1.000%) T: @arete101z @FXtraderMI @ewarren @realDonaldTrump If you vote for people like Hillary Obama and Elizabeth Warren you are corrupt if you support it you're part of it
C: (1.000%) T: Who is the most electable Dem candidate right now?  Recent polls have Biden leading Trump by 8.1 points, Sanders leads by 5 and Warren leads by 2.4 ‚Äî within almost every poll‚Äôs margin of error.   https://t.co/fAnAs7XGai

C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke I didnt see you blaming AOC for the I.C.E. bombing, or Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooter, Bernie for the congressional baseball game shootong OR Obama for the shootings during his terms.  Your ignorance at blaming Trump for what happened in your hometown is astounding.
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill DON'T try to change the subject to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  TALK ABOUT GUNS   GUN VIOLENCE  GUN CONTROL  #Liberal #Conservative  #republican #democrat #Republican #Democrat #Christians #Christianity
C: (1.000%) T: @SolomonRCJH Okay, I can agree with this logic. I have my red flags about literally every candidate that walks into office. It‚Äôs our job to demand better and realize that not EVERYONE is under Trump umbrella. Just like not everyone w/ Elizabeth Warren wants to be connected to Dayton shooter.
