C: (0.767%) T: @MSNBC STOP SHOWING TRUMP SPOUTING SHIT LIVE. Report on what was said afterwards. E.g., Trump claimed opponents were  trying to link him to the shooting for politcal advantage, then linked the Dayton shooter to Elizabeth Warren for political advantage.
C: (1.000%) T: @minnesotaBASS With that logic I suppose if you support Bernie, or Elizabeth Warren you are responsible for the Dayton, Ohio shooting?
C: (0.784%) T: @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachJoaquinCastro #Dayton   Democrats: ‚ÄúTrump is to blame for the El Paso shooting b/c the shooter didn‚Äôt hate Trump!‚Äù  **But what about the Dayton shooter, who was a radical Leftist socialist who loved Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, &amp; who wanted open borders?**   Dems: https://t.co/X2wgPoxRkZ
C: (1.000%) T: @EmocracyNow @Royce35007785 @classiclib3ral @LevineJonathan @benshapiro The Dayton shooter was the guy who hated Trump, liked Elizabeth Warren and was a lefty. Betts is the mass shooter of Dayton Ohio. The El Paso shooter hated politicians and big corporations, and the "Mexican invasion". Crusius is the mass shooter of El Paso.

C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Sanders is NOT a Democrat. Facts matter. It's really a great point that these people do not want us to know they are donating to Trump. That says it all. I proudly donate to Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and others.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren How do you plan to keep Conservative Christian children &amp; parents safe from SATAN WORSHIPPING, Mass Murdering, Socialist, Elizabeth Warren Supporters???

C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Guessing Beto doesn‚Äôt care about Dayton and the radical Antifa loving Elizabeth Warren fan and killer because it doesn‚Äôt fit his narrative.  Beto will never be President.  His ideas would wreck the economy we have and drive all major corporations out of the country.

C: (0.816%) T: @KamalaHarris Every democrat candidate and MSM news network has done nothing but politicize this tragedy all I‚Äôve heard is ban guns the El Paso was a right winger and blaming Trumps while failing to mention the Ohio shooter was left wing and endorsed Elizabeth Warren it‚Äôs really sad.
C: (1.000%) T: @SteveScalise I am VERY proud to say that I have donated money and will donate my time to Elizabeth Warren. And what Congressman Castro has done is only dangerous if Democrats act like Republicans and attack these donors. PS Boycotting is NOT = mailing pipe bombs!
C: (1.000%) T: @TEE1031 @PrplMnkyCupcake @RepEscobar @aimeeallison @realDonaldTrump Is anybody holding Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Ohio shooting? because that shooter was an outspoken supporter of Elizabeth Warren and a registered Democrat... I just don't see the same demands being made
C: (1.000%) T: @dcexaminer I guess you're ignoring that the Dayton shooter was a hardcore socialist, supporter of Elizabeth Warren, and supporter of ANTIFA.  The party of unity sure does promote a lot of division &amp; chaos
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to invest an additional $200 billion in rural communities to boost population, add new jobs and place a focus on sustainable practices that would increase farmers' pay, according to a new plan she has released.  https://t.co/1O9gCCdb7y via @DMRegister
C: (1.000%) T: @greg_price11 @DLoesch By this logic Joe, Elizabeth Warren supports mass shootings. Wake up Joe.  Warren doesn‚Äôt support the Dayton murderer and Trump is NOT a racist.
