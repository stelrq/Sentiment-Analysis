C: (1.000%) T: "...the question of how women might make themselves 'likable' looms large and perpetually unsolvable ... So what are women going to do?" @rtraister's profile of @ewarren is a brilliant depiction of a woman whose own qualifications work against her https://t.co/F9fNom3Ar8
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr @ewarren posted on social media, a video, while she was guzzling on a beer. In Indiana, children are not permitted in bars so they donâ€™t see such things. So, Elizabeth Warren is an public alcoholic because she drank beer on a social media video. All liberals are too!!!
C: (1.000%) T: I by no means support Trump or think itâ€™s okay to support him... BUT itâ€™s not okay to do this.   I wouldnâ€™t want to be targeted for my support of Hillary Clinton, Kamala, or Elizabeth Warren. This is wrong. https://t.co/BYODO5XF6l
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/cMQz966yHs
C: (1.000%) T: @vickie_babbitt @JonathanBlitzer @JoaquinCastrotx @nytimes Yes, I'm sure he murdered his sister because of Elizabeth Warren ðŸ™„
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @SenWarren @ewarren met privately with chief of the Cherokee Nation to apologize for identifying herself as Native American. She reportedly met primarily to express her regret for her Oct release of a DNA test she tried to use to establish the legitimacy of her claim https://t.co/hpByCpsEXF
C: (1.000%) T: @RileyHaganIII @johnatrevino1 @TimRunsHisMouth @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl @TwitterSupport How come Warren contributors, myself included R proud to announce to the world that I contributed to her campaign?I am proud to announce it because I didnâ€™t contribute to the campaign of a hateful, horrible, garbage, POS and who I know is a POS. I CONTRIBUTED TO ELIZABETH WARREN!
C: (0.986%) T: Great response @kellyannepolls! Kellyanne Conway Targets Beto, Elizabeth Warren: I'm Going To Name and Shame https://t.co/rn1AuNhniw
C: (0.985%) T: @NBCNews Yes he was a Elizabeth warren leftist too. She radicalized him.
C: (0.994%) T: "The [Twitter] account fired off thousands of messages â€” including some supporting presidential hopeful senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and the sometimes violent Antifa" https://t.co/hQG8qyOvvN
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden check it out, Joe! this is about #Demhate &amp; #Leftvio  https://t.co/fqexLDaZyj https://t.co/vVoaDoIE7H
C: (1.000%) T: Cardi B called the Dayton shooter a white supremacist. In reality, he supported Elizabeth Warren, a DEMOCRAT. !DONâ€™T TRUST WHAT CELEBRITIES SAY! #FakeNews
C: (0.989%) T: @cnnbrk Why is Elizabeth Warren not being questioned about a woman hating supporter of hers that was the latest active shooter!?!?!?!  The media blames Trump but his supporters aren't doing this crap. It's always a loser demoncrat.
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump How come you didnâ€™t mention Elizabeth Warren? The Ohio shooter supported her.  Why didnâ€™t you mention AOC? The antifa thug who attacked the ICE facility quoted her words.  Why not Bernie? The recent school shooters in Colorado were Jew hating Socialists.   STOP BLAMING TRUMP!
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis So who is at fault for the shooting in Ohio? That person was an avowed leftist and reportedly a supporter of Elizabeth Warren. Why point fingers when we should be having actual discussions. Please sit down sir, youâ€™ve got nothing to really contribute to this conversation.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren wants you to believe you are helpless &amp; only she, and the Feds can save you. Donâ€™t be Elizabeth Warren!   You Can't Fix Other People, But You Can Fix Yourself https://t.co/Yucy0JIgtG
C: (1.000%) T: agreed all around! this is a fantastic profile (and made me wish, yet again, that Elizabeth Warren coulda been my law prof) https://t.co/JV6mHA32hL
C: (1.000%) T: Great article by R Traister. Sure enough, I feel like help is on the way https://t.co/8pdJ9Sxwog
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren to the rescue. Give me a freakin break.
C: (0.999%) T: @NateSilver538 False.  I'm a Bernie fan and I also like Elizabeth Warren.  Generalizations suck.  #FakeNews
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to make sure Americans get deduction
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib are you willing to walk back that comment now that we know for certain that the Dayton shooter was a socialist Elizabeth Warren Satan worshipping individual?
C: (1.000%) T: when you are feeling sad about the state of the world just donate to elizabeth warrenâ€™s campaign it helps a little https://t.co/kxEyNp2cYV
C: (1.000%) T: @NBCNews What was his mind loaded with?  Liberal BS, HATE &amp; call to action by the likes of Elizabeth Warren &amp; other liberals.  Why not look at the real cause, you MSM try to pin fake thoughs  related to @POTUS , when real facts stare you in the face but , no. You don't report the truth!
C: (1.000%) T: If you werenâ€™t already a Warren fan, this will make you one. And if you werenâ€™t already a Rebecca Traister fan, this will make you one.   Just so good.  https://t.co/4FVLYhSRw3
