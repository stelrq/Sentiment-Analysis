C: (0.993%) T: @SainttreyTrey @LeftwardSwing @DanielStromgre1 @SenWarren Unfortunately Warren is not a good option. Despite claiming to resist Trump, she voted multiple times to give that madman billions more for weapons &amp; war so he can more easily destroy the world w/his terrible policies. This should be disqualifying --&gt; https://t.co/0knff8S30G

C: (1.000%) T: The confirmation bias and mental gymnastics required to overlook Elizabeth Warren's problems is no different then what you must do for Mayor Pete or Kamala Harris.    The time has come to seek unity and converge on a singular choice  https://t.co/zKrWjpQJcV
C: (1.000%) T: You just happen to run across Elizabeth Warren buying lemonade from a stand on a random street corner in Iowa when your twitter profile says your a group and development reporter covering Elizabeth Warren. I ain't buying it and I bet she didn't either.   https://t.co/Ym3jOUwIJf

C: (1.000%) T: @briandkr65 @DonaldJTrumpJr That's not what happened to this POS shooter and you know it. Maybe there should be a cartoon with the dayton shooter and Elizabeth Warren as his guide since that's what his motivation was. Oh and antifa and anti gun! Dumb untrue cartoon. Use your head dude. Stupid.
C: (1.000%) T: @RichardCRogers @DylanRGoldberg @AbbyLowery @BernieSanders I oppose for paying for anyone's education except for my own. Elizabeth Warren was paid $400,000 to teach ONE class at Harvard cause she was native (joke). Schools should take some responsibility for encouraging those loans &amp; not pay outrageous salaries to undeserving professors.
