C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx If you say Trump is inciting violence how come you are silent when the Ohio shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter ?  You are a piece of lying shit !
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib The one shooter supported Elizabeth Warren.  Why are you lying?????  You‚Äôre deceiving all of your followers üò°
C: (1.000%) T: I would love to see an Elizabeth Warren FCC. https://t.co/deGuZ3IG2k
C: (1.000%) T: Would love to see Elizabeth Warren shove "Pocahontas" up Trump's ass in a live Presidential debate.
C: (1.000%) T: Let's talk about the Ohio shooter's support for Elizabeth Warren! https://t.co/pkxaVG9tMc
C: (0.729%) T: Kamala Harris has not lost a battle with Trump.  Kirsten Gillibrand has not lost a battle with Trump.  Beto O'Rourke has not lost a battle with Trump.   Hell, even Amy Klobuchar would eat Trump's lunch with her comb.  This is a uniquely Elizabeth Warren problem.

C: (1.000%) T: @GizmoCrypto @washingtonpost He wasn't the inspiration.  One attack was inspired by a leftist, socialist, Elizabeth Warren supporter who was in a porno band and had a hit list and murder list in high school.  Second one with a manifesto specifically stated his feelings were way before Trump. You were lied to
C: (0.987%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Oddly, I don‚Äôt remember Elizabeth Warren ever inciting violence or hatred, espousing racism or targeting a specific group of people. But I can tell you who has.
C: (1.000%) T: @goddesszee143 And the Dayton murderer was a leftist, Antifa supporter and Elizabeth Warren supporter. She must be responsible. YOU ARE A TOOL!

C: (0.978%) T: @Conner4Sheila @Castro4Congress @facebook Have you heard about the shooting in Dayton, Ohio? This shooter was quite a violent Democrat!  https://t.co/PLwTfkyiGf
C: (1.000%) T: @Swog1234 I saw Rick say this on MSNBC last night. I'm sure he was paid handsomely. But, I was very disappointed in his support of Connor Betts who was an avid supporter of Elizabeth Warren. I was horrified at his support of James Hodgkinson who was an avid Bernie Sanders supporter...
C: (1.000%) T: @Guiller55849440 .@realDonaldTrump  The best shot Trump has is if Elizabeth Warren or one of a host of other socialized progressive wins and faces off against him. They‚Äôll scare off enough votes to favor Trump. However, if Biden rebounds, I think at this point he‚Äôll beat out Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump The Dayton shooter labeled himself as a avid Elizabeth Warren supporter...will we see you target her donors like you did Trump supporters?

C: (0.985%) T: @mousecoachjenn @ABCPolitics He didn‚Äôt incite this tragedy no more than Elizabeth Warren incited the one in Dayton. What you‚Äôre saying is irrational and, quite frankly, completely ridiculous. #dontbeadipshit
C: (1.000%) T: "If Dems nominate a strong candidate, it will also help downballot candidates win. But if a progressive like Elizabeth Warren emerges from the primaries, Dem congressional candidates will be forced to distance themselves from their own party‚Äôs nominee."  https://t.co/aY63DRWCsO
C: (1.000%) T: That feeling when you score with a great comeback to ‚Äúhow‚Äôs that Kool-Aid taste,‚Äù and the entire comment thread gets deleted.   Incidentally, the Elizabeth Warren Kool-Aid tastes like victory.
C: (1.000%) T: On behalf of Owen, I say I proudly support Elizabeth Warren and will vote for her because she has a plan to help keep us safe. My son was told to hide in a corner and throw books at a shooter at his High School. He told me there is no safe place at school and if he dies. He dies. https://t.co/xSQmz5dpzm
C: (1.000%) T: @CanelliLisa @USMCLiberal The real question you should be asking yourself is why are the Socialist Democrats so eager to take our guns? How can you watch them call us dirty Walmart shoppers and not put two and two together when a Walmart shot up by an Elizabeth Warren supporter? Come on lady.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx The Ohio shooter was a self-described socialist and Elizabeth Warren fan. His social media profile shows long history of sharing support for antifa accounts, causes &amp; individuals. He recently called Tacoma ICE firebomber a "martyr".
C: (0.983%) T: So is Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Dayton shooter?
