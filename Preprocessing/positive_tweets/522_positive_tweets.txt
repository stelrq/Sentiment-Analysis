C: (1.000%) T: Taking guns away from American Citizens is the first step in Government controlling us. Next they take our property, tell us where to work, what kind of job we can have, tax the life out of us—And, before you can say “Elizabeth Warren,” we are a socialistic nation.  Really?
C: (1.000%) T: don’t come to me asking why i don’t like elizabeth warren, you know what she did!  not my fault i can’t excuse the racism JUST to comfort you

C: (0.993%) T: I was asked today if Elizabeth Warren was insane,  I said yes. https://t.co/ElkEqsrTrn
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisMurphyCT @brianbeutler "Here’s the thing: When a candidate tells you about all the things that aren’t possible…they’re telling you something very important. They’re telling you that they will not fight for you." —Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Perhaps Elizabeth Warren can create a federal Office of Barbers &amp; Stylist to address this gender inequality. https://t.co/tBhwgxcUkp
C: (0.995%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was Indian. I said no she’s a liar and used it to go through college.
C: (1.000%) T: This lady who covers Elizabeth Warren “just happened to come across” Warren in a residential neighborhood where she was buying lemonade from kids.  Lmao this is the most staged photo op I’ve seen in a while. https://t.co/rRF6R28eJa
C: (0.992%) T: @shaunking Seriously, enough of blaming President Trump on other people's actions. It's getting old.   Is this the liberal rule? If that's the case, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both have blood on their hands, since the Dayton shooter supported both of them.
C: (0.997%) T: @USCCB @BishopDewane @BishopFabre Looks like your followers are blaming Pres. Trump and not the Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, Maxine Waters, Joe Biden, cnn, msnbc &amp; all other liberals condoning violence against deplorables.
C: (1.000%) T: Looking at the current Democrat field of 20+ candidates, it really is frightening that Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are the BEST they could muster. And Kamala just collapsed after one tough debate question!
C: (1.000%) T: @HartsockRob @true198 @AOC It was Elizabeth Warren who started it. AOC commented on a response and you responded to her reply.  https://t.co/g97GLCxE8h

C: (1.000%) T: @calebp404 It’s not surprising considering it’s coming from Elizabeth Warren...
C: (0.998%) T: @ewarren And someone asked President Trump if you are a Native American. And he said no, but you pretended to be one for decades to advance your career. Phony Elizabeth Warren. Now back to my cooking. I’m making an old favorite from Pow Wow Chow....
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is also the only candidate that sends me emails with subject lines that don’t make me feel like I’m getting invited to a meeting where I’ll be fired.
C: (1.000%) T: @business @bopinion I think Elizabeth Warren addressed this about 15 to 20 years ago.
C: (1.000%) T: Sarah Reese Jones @PoliticusSarah Joe Biden and Cory Booker both gained three points in the four early voting states last week, while Elizabeth Warren dropped five points and Kamala Harris two. https://t.co/FnYgLzQW8d
C: (1.000%) T: today in washington president elizabeth warren signed an executive order making wifi on planes free
C: (1.000%) T: @SpinneyJr @BadAsVlad @ARmastrangelo @realDonaldTrump Yes we should. The man in Dayton was not driven to kill people because of Bernie or Warren.  He may have advocated for socialist programs, but he did not kill people in their name, because violence is antithetical to what Bernie and Elizabeth Warren stand for.
C: (1.000%) T: @RightWingWatch There’s no fucking chance Trump has a cure and is holding it hostage for a second term. And if he is, he doesn’t deserve a second term. I hope all of these people get cancer only to be cured by Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.507%) T: @lil_yenta We will defeat the schmuck but with the wonderful Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's Stoner Army grows every day!!! Legalize Liz !!! Warre... https://t.co/b83oTmaQhv via @YouTube
C: (1.000%) T: @timwyman92 @HuffPost Maybe you should listen to Elizabeth Warren. She IS a feisty grandma AND has actual plans with implementation already mapped out.
C: (1.000%) T: @RobertLaurie Are you actually expecting consistency or honesty from Elizabeth Warren???
