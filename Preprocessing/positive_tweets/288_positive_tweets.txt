C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Michael Brown robbed a store, resisted arrest, assaulted &amp; tried to kill a police officer &amp; then tried to escape, he wasn‚Äôt murdered &amp; Elizabeth Warren knows that yet she‚Äôs happy to blatantly lie about it w/the intentions of inciting more violence against conservatives.
C: (1.000%) T: @HeatherMatarazz It‚Äôs funny. I live in Brooklyn but get texts from Elizabeth Warren üòÇ
C: (1.000%) T: Our administration has ‚Äúnational conservatives.‚Äù They advocate unprecedented expansion of gov‚Äôt to purge America of respect for market forces and to affirm confidence in gov‚Äôt as a social engineer allocating wealth and opportunity.   #maga #winning   https://t.co/2bDOmqzwyp
C: (0.984%) T: @ewarren Never forget - Dayton mass murderer was an Elizabeth Warren worshipper
C: (1.000%) T: "We need to call it out: Fox News is a hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists."     Elizabeth Warren (our next pres)  #FauxNews    #TrumpBodyCount
C: (1.000%) T: @BidawiFawzi Try pulling that old, tired argument on Elizabeth Warren. She‚Äôll tell you exactly where the money will come from. She‚Äôll school your sorry ass on economics. Get a life.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren reached 1 million donors on July 26. You may want to revise this post, since you‚Äôre spending donors‚Äô money on it. https://t.co/IogHXdnkkm https://t.co/JQ88W4ZXya
C: (0.983%) T: @ewarren Where were you Elizabeth Warren when these shootings happened under YOUR watch?  #Obama https://t.co/QkzvcbLT2b
C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano He‚Äôs the Democratic front runner who currently has the best shot of beating Trump. Elizabeth Warren is second, sorry but white women didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary, let‚Äôs focus on winning for once
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC I guess you are now calling Antifa thugs white supremacist,,, and also the Dayton shooter who supports Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson At the moment "Elizabeth Warren" receives nothing but praise from the media in their hopes of propping her up to take down "Bernie Sanders" by splitting the progressive vote! Warren supporters have no reason to be upset, they are not the ones being attacked on a daily basis!
C: (1.000%) T: Stay Loud, Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs advise to ‚Å¶@MomsDemand‚Å© Action, as to what should we do over the next few months to get ‚Å¶@senatemajldr‚Å© to bring the Background Check bill to a vote. https://t.co/tVZicekLJC
C: (1.000%) T: I don't look like  Elizabeth Warren.  I just took a pic with the real one
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I was asked too..  My reply was, "He's as much a white supremacist as Elizabeth Warren is a Native American".
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump QUESTION:  Why is the lamestream media all over the El Paso shooting and completely ignoring the Dayton, OH shooting?  ANSWER:  Because the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and the El Paso shooter was a Trump supporter.  Which fits the liberal narrative?
C: (1.000%) T: Pay no attention to the avowed socialist and Elizabeth Warren-supporter who committed a mass shooting in Dayton - https://t.co/Y4cYDrzn1b
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke QUESTION:  Why is the lamestream media all over the El Paso shooting and completely ignoring the Dayton, OH shooting?  ANSWER:  Because the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and the El Paso shooter was a Trump supporter.  Which fits the liberal narrative?
C: (1.000%) T: George Will takes Tucker Carlson and other 'Nationalist Conservatives' to a well-deserved trip behind the woodshed for their infatuation with collectivist and authoritarian government as the instrument of choice to address social maladies.  https://t.co/4xAK8Lt35t
C: (1.000%) T: @Jude95240899 @ChuckMastan @TomiLahren No, it is because it is the internet and connotation is ambiguous. The Dayton shooter is hands down a leftist and an Antifa member. They guy even said he was going to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  FFS where do you get your shitty info?
C: (1.000%) T: @buckygoldymom @ewarren You better not be calling me a Trump wannabe. If so, you are massively confused. Elizabeth Warren is a Bernie Sanders chameleon. Look at her history. Clintonite, Reaganite... no thanks to both. Lip service is all she offers. No history of any major reform. #CantTrustThis
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow I'm waiting for you to accuse Elizabeth Warren of having sex with a porn star while the wife was home with their newborn. And then later attempted to pay off the porn star for her silence.
C: (1.000%) T: Can anyone imagine Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris or Bernie Sanders dealing with the head of North Korea Kim Jung-on?  üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
C: (1.000%) T: @YogGar1 @Donna40517794 @ericswalwell Dayton... Democrat Elizabeth Warren supporter, antifa. Pulse nightclub...muslim, stem school shooting ... transgender Democrats. We can play this back-and-forth game all day. The fact is they're all mentally ill.
C: (1.000%) T: People complaining that Elizabeth Warren doesn't have enough moral vision because she also has *plans* can go fall in a pit filled with snakes.
C: (1.000%) T: She is so friggin' good at campaigning. Like, literally everywhere she goes, she not only impresses the hell out of people, but she surprises them with her warmth &amp; humanity. Those are good traits for a presidential candidate.  https://t.co/Yg0r8GefbQ
