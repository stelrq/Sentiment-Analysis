C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/zPa8BjBoOf via @twitchyteam
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren We know you're a habitual liar tho, so naturally we're curious as to why someone,like you,  lies so much.What's in your closet, Pocahontas? No worries, #qanon patriots will dig up your totem pole of corruption&amp;expose the scribed life of Elizabeth Warren. :) #WWG1WGA #AnonsKnow
C: (0.994%) T: @BwFastbob48 @bill_heffe @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Okay, then why doesn't Chris also call upon Elizabeth Warren to condemn the Dayton shooter?

C: (1.000%) T: @cybergirll6 @Ashley4Kxxx @TheAnaBraga Satanist, socialist, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie sanders, AOC, and Ilhan Omar supporter...   What they had in common? They were fucking weirdos who were to awkward to get laid so it made them resentful and angry at the world. That's where basically every shooter stems from.
C: (1.000%) T: @joncoopertweets I wonder why Elizabeth Warren DIDN‚ÄôT show up in Ohio after the liberal supporter of the hateful terrorist organization ANTIFA killed people in the name of socialism
C: (1.000%) T: I‚Äôm going to lost my top 5 choices for our nominee in order of preference w/ reason: (1) Beto O‚ÄôRourke - he is genuine, he is wicked smart, he‚Äôs humble, he has zero fucks left to give; (2) Elizabeth Warren - she is intelligent, she seems down to earth, she has zero fucks to give
C: (0.997%) T: @mpbutterworth @ewarren @1033ampradio White supremacist? Look it up for me. Also while your there look up what a fraud is. Maybe there you will find Elizabeth Warren üëãüèª
C: (1.000%) T: @wondermann5 @dmcrawford @TulsiGabbard Elizabeth Warren was part of the GOP for 50 fucking years. Tulsi was brought into a homophobic group by her father and renounced everything and apologized 7 years ago. She‚Äôs got a 100% LGBT voting record.  All presidents speak with the Saudis, who financed 9/11. They apologists?
C: (1.000%) T: Political genius Elizabeth Warren drives around Iowa is a gas guzzling behemoth screeching about the dangers of global warming. #GreenNewDeal  #ClimateChange  #DemocratsAreHypocrites https://t.co/eFyMCdVgJe
C: (0.994%) T: @JayInslee @BetoORourke How about the Dayton Ohio shooting? Are you ignoring that because the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan?
C: (1.000%) T: @WKLBC89 @DraftTulsi Bernie has been and is such a hero. But, with a corporatist like Elizabeth Warren at his side only a heartbeat away, he's not treating Climate Change, endless wars, healthcare, free speech, injustices &amp; inequalities the respect they deserve.   Or his future constituents.
C: (0.994%) T: @SykesCharlie Ask him if he is a fan of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @thetimesscot @Anna_Soubry @DAaronovitch So is Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Dayton shooting as the perpetrator was a left wing nut who admired her. Just fuck off with this bullshit. The only one responsible is the shooter, clown
C: (0.960%) T: @Angela_Enders @kidgolferman I demand Elizabeth Warren be held criminally responsible for the Dayton #OhioShooting
C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton shooter was a Democrat, as he endorsed Elizabeth Warren and urged people to "Vote blue for gods sake." Yet, no prominent Republicans are blaming any Democrats for that shooting; nor should they.  If only the Democrats had such class. https://t.co/jqxlCTHC4B
C: (1.000%) T: But, the Dayton shooter was a far far-leftist.   Secondly, if he was targeting Blacks, there would be a dozen places better to stage his attack.   He hated President Trump and supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Terrific piece by @rtraister on @ewarren the teacher. America, show that we deserve her as president. https://t.co/SR4j3NDCrw

C: (0.742%) T: Trump today has attacked:  Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley "Sleepy Joe Biden" Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Shepard Smith "Fake News CNN" "The Failing New York Times" "The Lamestream Media"  But he's trying to unify the country after Dayton and El Paso.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Let's create a Dept. For the Control of Idiotic Liberal Internet Access.  We'll build the main offices at 2020 Pocahontas Drive and call it the Elizabeth Warren Center for the Research of Liberal Internet Stupidity.  First test criteria: Your tweets  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
C: (0.993%) T: @Dan38461624 @BarbarainFL @DocMcCockiner @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs just reeling with guilt over the fact that everybody who supports Elizabeth Warren is a terrorist.
C: (1.000%) T: A new national poll on the Democratic presidential primary race suggests it could soon start to feel like a two-way contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/QY94bAwQoV
C: (0.993%) T: @dccc Elizabeth Warren and I already donated to her. So quit pretending yhis is a poll when its just an attempt to get money. I will donate to whom I want to.
C: (0.986%) T: Dayton mayor warns we will 'probably' see more mass shootings because of... https://t.co/wHnxMg8KIW via @YouTube- Dayton should be ashamed of their hateful mayor. She forgets the shooter was inspired by Elizabeth Warren &amp; Socialism. She was very rude &amp; smirky!
