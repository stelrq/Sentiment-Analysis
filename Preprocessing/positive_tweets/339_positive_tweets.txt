C: (1.000%) T: @philosophrob She has been bought throughout her career and pledges to be bought again if she becomes the democratic nominee. Warren ripped Joe Biden‚Äôs big Philly fund-raiser.

C: (1.000%) T: Biden would be, at best, a passive placeholder.   We need comprehensive, effective planning for the 21st Century and a strong woman to take us there.   I support Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/bsAesrN6nX
