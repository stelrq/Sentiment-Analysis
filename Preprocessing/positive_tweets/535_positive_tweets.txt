C: (1.000%) T: I did think Elizabeth Warren was a bit weak, but she really has come out fighting for healthcare reform with some serious clout. The center of the Dem party are looking like craven capitulators. Much like Lab in the UK, it's clear they are fighting against the maj of their party

C: (0.997%) T: @saletan @LittleMsOpinion Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs comment is false and intentionally malicious. It‚Äôs clear defamation.
C: (0.990%) T: Deep fakes will be the final assault on truth. Imagine how the right would run with footage of Elizabeth Warren saying ‚Äútax the poor.‚Äù But how do you combat perfect facsimile video? https://t.co/2j9KHBUrin
C: (1.000%) T: None of that is a part of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren's platform. Do they really just wake up and lie like this? https://t.co/ZGbqxeK3YE
C: (1.000%) T: @Goss30Goss I am fully on board!! There are several good candidates &amp; any of them would be better than trump, but for me Elizabeth Warren stands out as the most well rounded candidate. She's who I want as President. But if by chance it is one of the other candidates I am still voting blue!!
C: (0.532%) T: @Alscool1 @Cmoore704 Plus, Harry Reid, Elizabeth Warren, Donna Brazile, and Tulsi Gabbard all agreed it was rigged. AND DWS was forced to resign in disgrace from the DNC because of her obvious cheating.  Cutting the number of debates to six and scheduling them to minimize viewers speaks for itself.
C: (1.000%) T: @Martina It won't matter who runs for senate if you fools nominate Elizabeth Warren. She has 0 chance of helping in Texas. You Warren supporters need to stop telling Beto to run for senate.
C: (0.961%) T: Elizabeth warren criminal justice reform....  Skip criminal justice.  She is the Decider.

C: (1.000%) T: @zennhub @AcklandeViel @RooLivesAgain32 @SuburbanKL @newscomauHQ If that guy is white, then Elizabeth Warren is native american.
C: (0.994%) T: 'Nice standards': Tom Nichols will gladly vote for pot-stirring liar Elizabeth Warren (or any Dem) because at least she isn't Trump https://t.co/weyhmsJY5N
C: (0.996%) T: Joe Biden atop Democratic rivals in new Iowa poll, but Elizabeth Warren is catching up https://t.co/piWeQ4n3jv
C: (1.000%) T: Here's how Elizabeth Warren made her fortune. https://t.co/FUe5ir81zu
C: (1.000%) T: Democratic hopeful Elizabeth Warren has released yet another plan. This time she wants to regulate and tax private equity transactions... https://t.co/DtossdWflW
C: (1.000%) T: Michael Brown was killed because he was combative stole from a store &amp; did not listen to the police.  Stop pitting black &amp; white against each other Elizabeth Warren. When an officer gives commands listen. U have a good outcome when you listen &amp; don't resist. https://t.co/WKBxYtWPA3
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I asked myself "is Elizabeth Warren a race baiting bigot?" The answer is YES! So idiotic, so out of touch w/ main stream Americans, so in touch w/ Main stream media. #KAG2020
C: (1.000%) T: @normanhreece @NoahCRothman My man! There's so much to be said about Elizabeth Warren's lie, no need to go all crazy with demons,  KKK and rats.  You sound like a mad man.  Take a nap, we got it from here.  You could've just said. Under Obama/Holder, DOJ found nothing wrong with the shooting of Brown.
C: (1.000%) T: @sairasameerarao Why would we ever vote for someone like this to serve our country? We have had enough with hateful and dividing politicians like this one. Including the "squad", Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, media etc. Why serve a country you hate?
C: (1.000%) T: @RealMattCouch @seabees1822 No surprise. Take a look at Weinstein's : Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand https://t.co/KH2x3JZeyw
C: (1.000%) T: @brithume So in Elizabeth Warren's America you're not only not innocent until proven guilty (Kavanaugh), you're guilty even after you're proven innocent.  Does anybody want to live in that America?
C: (0.667%) T: @ScannerEars @CNN Of course CNN says one was a white nationalist but omits the other as an Antifa sympathizer and Democrat supporter of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren These Parents should take most of the responsibility   for the heartache the littlest of children are upset, you break the law you hurt your family. Elizabeth Warren is using this as a way to get herself heard, do I think she cares,? not one bit. Since we know she is a Fibber.
