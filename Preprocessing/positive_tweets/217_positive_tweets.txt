C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Except in your profile you state you are ‚Äúcovering Elizabeth Warren.‚Äù  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #ThesePeopleAreStupid #JournalismIsDead #FakeNews
C: (0.993%) T: Asked if she thought President Trump was a white supremacist, Senator Elizabeth Warren responded without hesitation: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù https://t.co/TaY2RXQ1T0
C: (1.000%) T: It is the duty of all Americans to speak this simple and obvious truth. https://t.co/dyVnC0UbOj
C: (1.000%) T: I want to meet Elizabeth Warren she just seems like America's Cool Aunt
C: (1.000%) T: Here's what would happen if the U.S. canceled $1 trillion of student debt. https://t.co/66slpuPOaS
C: (1.000%) T: @GovMikeHuckabee @KummersTim #CNN reporter was probably even more baffled to learn guy ended up not being a white supremacist but one of their own radical, left, socialist inspired Antifa thugs that supported Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders..
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx BOTH shooters were leftists!  So Paso shooter had his profile changed within MINUTES of the shooting.  I wonder who did that?ü§î And other shooter was ANTIFA, Satanist &amp; Elizabeth Warren supporter!  You doxxed those supporters to your insane base to trigger MORE violence! üò†üò†üò†
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a moron who had the gaul to appropriate an american Indian's  identity in order to gain admittance into Harvard. Thus stealing a seat from a real indian. I said yes.
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren @jorge_guajardo Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a socialist, I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: "Yet the left-wing favorites ‚Äî Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren ‚Äî are all running on agendas that do not earn majority support among the general electorate." Will 2020 Be a Repeat of 2004 for Democrats? https://t.co/QJsUP2e9ev
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren also said she was a Native American at one time.  Once a liar always a liar.
C: (0.999%) T: @AaronBrynen @PettyLorne So Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth warren are responsible for the Ohio shooter with that stupid logic
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‚Äòmurdered by a white police officer‚Äô https://t.co/6dEp43ZA5r

C: (1.000%) T: @TheHillofRoses @scottsantens @stephaniequilao @nikoCSFB @ewarren I voted Yes, but I don't know any internet personality rooting for Elizabeth Warren. Her base is mostly progressive women that want to see a female president.
C: (1.000%) T: @afrosabi @Wonderbitch81 Joe Biden is not racist, but he hasn't arrived on matters involving race. Get behind Elizabeth Warren, the best of the rest.
C: (1.000%) T: @davidhogg111 So David . Explain the change of the profile for this guy right after the shooting. I m sure he did not change it . And then there is Dayton where is the outrage about that guy and the support for the leftist  Elizabeth Warren??? I‚Äôm waiting...

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren 2020. Don‚Äôt make me vote for Grandpa Gaffe. https://t.co/czrwpFqiJy
C: (1.000%) T: @jonahrosenbaum as an aside from this obviously fucking insane person- i do think if say, elizabeth warren had gone on rogan or to fox news many many bernie people would be saying that it‚Äôs evidence that she‚Äôs lying about her beliefs
C: (1.000%) T: @nsw43 @BernieSanders @Kanew Hey I‚Äôm just curious, but what is the appeal for Elizabeth Warren vs Bernie? I have my own reasons for supporting Bernie, but I want to hear the other side.
C: (1.000%) T: January-July Trump poured $7.9 million into political advertising on Facebook -- four times more than Sen. Bernie Sanders over the same period and nearly five times more than Sen. Elizabeth Warren #FuckFacebook
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisDJackson @DrJasonJohnson No, she has not.  As soon as she launched her campaign, the media tried to ‚ÄúHillary‚Äù her with their ridiculous ‚Äúis she likable enough?‚Äù nonsense.   She is rising because she‚Äôs not playing the game.   Elizabeth Warren is running a campaign on her own terms!!  #Warren2020
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren  was a Democratic Slut, I said yes!
