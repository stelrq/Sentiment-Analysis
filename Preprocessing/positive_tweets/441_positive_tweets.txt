C: (1.000%) T: @onepointofvu @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @OANN That person was an ANTIFA supporter and Elizabeth Warren supporter! Is she responsible for it! No, the person who committed the crime is responsible! You people need to have compassion for those families and their friends!üôèüá∫üá∏ü¶Ö
C: (1.000%) T: This is not a target list.  They are donors.   This list was already part of the public record.   I would have no problem if my name appeared on a list of those who donated to Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris for example.  In fact, I would be proud. https://t.co/4bHh1OLLtO
C: (0.513%) T: These mass-murders have us crazy in the U.S. With the Dayton, Ohio killer, he was a "liberal," Elizabeth Warren supporter. He hated conservatives, Republicans, and "white supremacists." Yet, MSM and protesters in Dayton are blaming Trump for his killings. How about blaming him?
C: (0.995%) T: @Proxy_Tank @guypbenson @realDonaldTrump Don't call Elizabeth Warren "dude."
C: (1.000%) T: @RepDougCollins They are donors.   This list was already part of the public record.   I would have no problem if my name appeared on a list of those who donated to Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris for example.  In fact, I would be proud.
C: (1.000%) T: @ReFlex76 Yes sweetie and the Daytona shooter hated Republicans and Fox News, had connections to antifa and loved Elizabeth Warren.  The El Paso shooter was obsessed with race but he was not right wing. He wanted UBI, national health insurance, and environmentalism. He quoted the Lorax
C: (0.518%) T: @DebbyMcG1 @WaywardWinifred @JeffBezos Dont expect any anti Elizabeth Warren campaign ads from Bernie because they are friends
C: (0.998%) T: @CNN What a clown. Never mind that it was an an Elizabeth Warren supporter and Antifa member that perpetrated the carnage in his state. Resign, you fraud.
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC No, the vast majority of mass shootings, like in Chicago, Dayton, are not White Supremists!!!  Dayton shooter was a progressive who followed Elizabeth Warren, so?  Instead of casting hateful, vile language to be relevant, get on board &amp; do something to help! ü§¨ #WalkAway
C: (0.526%) T: Warren pledges to restore net neutrality if elected https://t.co/DwYxCn6tSl via @dailydot
C: (1.000%) T: @ABCPolitics Well if Elizabeth Warren is a Native American and Rachel Dolezal is a black person and girls can be in the Boy Scouts and men can dress like women and pee in their bathrooms why can't a white dude be called Beto here in 2019?
C: (0.528%) T: @tomccarroll @ewarren Literally didn‚Äôt happen. You are just racist.   https://t.co/8Nn0tmGhbA
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is not only wanting to spend everyone's last dollar, she is trying to incite a class war and a race war. She is not entitled to everyone money, she should want people to earn their own.  There's no pride in accomplishment if everything is given to you! https://t.co/Rbk12KMc6c
C: (1.000%) T: @derek_mafs Here‚Äôs one I meet at a Elizabeth Warren tea üçµ social on a community bus üöå while campaigning for equality at bus stops............. https://t.co/ZaoDye3kkV
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Pete Buttigeig is Paul Montgomery Elizabeth Warren is Liz Herring Cory Booker is Tony Booker Eric Holder is Eric Himpton see the pattern, they don't want #Americans to know they are frauds. Anyone like to add more fake #politicians names? #Truth #WednesdayWisdom #FactsMatter
C: (1.000%) T: @Newsweek Hoax is the wrong word it‚Äôs over hyped and hyper focused in order to maintain a media narrative. You notice we hear nothing from the major networks on the killings in Ohio by a satanist Elizabeth Warren supporter that happened shortly after the Texas one.
C: (1.000%) T: @crystal4obama @ladyc10 Black candidates, especially Black female candidates, have to meet a certain set of unique benchmarks to be considered a ‚Äúserious‚Äù candidate. Hell, so do we in our places of work. The Obamas wrote the playbook. She just has to use it. And it‚Äôs not being a Black Elizabeth Warren.

C: (0.529%) T: @katiemusgrave_ this is the face of this brand of country?? a SOCIALIST WHO IS PRO ELIZABETH WARREN WHO LIES ABOUT HER ETHNIVITY TO GAIN EMPLOYMENT? A LIAR?  #BOYCOTTMUSGRAVE
C: (1.000%) T: I used to know someone who taught their dog to "smile", which meant the dog would just bare its' teeth in a kinda creepy snarling way.  Elizabeth Warren's photo ops remind me very heavily of that dog. https://t.co/KCaHDWqsbw
C: (0.987%) T: @gtconway3d @NicolleDWallace Hey what about reports that the Ohio shooter supported  Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and supported ANTIFA? DING DING DING DING DING
C: (1.000%) T: @TeaPartyUSA1 @ChairmanBuckley Wrong, the El Paso perpetrator was anti-Trump according to his manifesto.  The mass shooting perpetrator in Dayton, Ohio was a leftist, registered Democrat and @ewarren supporter.   Therefore his attack was an Elizabeth Warren inspired act of terrorism.
C: (0.995%) T: @mJoan_Co @Simplybeautif71 @therrienv @mymascaragirls @Gabriel38601273 @Fils_d_Artemis @Armi7119 @mommicality @Christa0003 @robbystarbuck @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl I dont know. But what I do know is that he was as a Democrat, supporter of Elizabeth Warren and followed accounts that praised Antifa on twitter.
