C: (1.000%) T: @MarkDice Today someone asked me if Elizabeth Warren was a nit wit. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: The strongest Dem ticket I reckon, at the moment, would be if Elizabeth Warren got the Dem nomination and Bernie ran as her running mate.  What do you guys reckon? #Election2020 https://t.co/epxImGFWgy

C: (0.711%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren, you never will be in WH. No matter how you try to buy illegal voters. People broke the law , they are undocumented, they are illegally in thi country,. They should take families and go back to where they came from. USA is country of law, not banana republic.

C: (1.000%) T: Barack Obama‚Äôs DOJ, specifically Eric Holder, cleared police of all wrong doing. Imagine supporting this ghoul Elizabeth Warren as she whores you out for your vote. Have some respect bros https://t.co/idjsoZynsS
C: (0.996%) T: @chrismartin1974 @mccuban And you sound like Elizabeth Warren believing she‚Äôs a Native American because that‚Äôs what she thinks. Next
C: (1.000%) T: @marcorubio Do you ever read the New Testament?   Read what Jesus said to the rich man. Read the greatest commandment and the second. Apply that to your job and that liar you support.  Oh, by the way, read the Mueller report.  If u can‚Äôt understand it, ask Elizabeth Warren to explain it.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth. My husband told me something about you I didn‚Äôt know. Is that a black faced cookie jar on top of your china cabinet ? It was on a live Instagram. https://t.co/AZJ9k78eMg

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren The Dayton, Ohio mass shooter was a proud Elizabeth Warren fanboy. Stop inciting mass shooters. Take the side of law enforcement instead of criminals. By the way, Michael Brown assaulted a convenient store clerk &amp; a cop on the day he was shot. Darren Wilson is a hero.
