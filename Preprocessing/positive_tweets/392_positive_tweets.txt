C: (1.000%) T: Iâ€™m like 70% certain Elizabeth Warren is not a pedophile BUT is at least beholden enough to the pedophile class to keep her mouth shut
C: (1.000%) T: @Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump So youâ€™ll be voting for who then? Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris? Whoâ€™s your pick for 2020 Mooch?
C: (1.000%) T: @ArielElyseGold @AlexWardVox @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a puppet of national security state. She supports meddling in China internal affairs but looks the other way from apartheid. Warren is cop. A fake progressive.
C: (1.000%) T: @Strandjunker I don't want to think about the past.   I want to think of the future with President Elizabeth Warren.  There will be so much Trump damage to repair. It's time to prepare.
C: (0.999%) T: @HelloWorld3327 @damnriggz @ComplexSports @Dloading @TwentyER In case youâ€™re still interested in this issue, this is worth reading.  https://t.co/p71vvruuGV
C: (1.000%) T: @Zebop @lvl28mage @kaicee118 @2020Delegates Welp guess I can't convince you. You said you like Elizabeth Warren because her supporters aren't bad I guess. I'm saying that's actually completely irrelevant when it comes to voting for anyone.
C: (1.000%) T: @politico metastasising into a creature with Elizabeth Warren's cheekbones, Joe Biden's parenting skills &amp; related to Jussie Smollett.
C: (0.843%) T: Geez, another "nationalist" (sarcasm). I guess he'll still be able to vote for Warren with prison reform - right (sarcasm)?   https://t.co/sU9Z7zKUNH   @AGAshleyMoody @FLSenate @joenegronfl @ambermariano @RepJoseOliva @RepMikeCaruso @FloridaGOP @GOP @HouseGOP @BillGalvano
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren You lied...straight up LIED, about your race for your own personal gain. The Dayton shooter was a huge Elizabeth Warren fan. You are preaching hate on a daily basis in cahoots with the DNC MSM!!!
C: (0.995%) T: @iamcardib Hey racist Jamcardib,  the Dayton shooter was a Democrat that loved Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA.   Sooooo their ya go!
C: (0.636%) T: @DaytonPolice @nanwhaley Here's a tip, the killer was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  BTW, she's a Democrat.
C: (1.000%) T: @RachelD34535677 @JoaquinCastrotx @jewishaction Iâ€™m curious as to why the headlines do not read:  Liberal, Elizabeth Warren supporter, Antifa loving, radicalized left wing nut job, kills 9 in Dayton.  The media needs to call it what it is.  #Hypocrisy
C: (1.000%) T: @FrankFigliuzzi1 88....Elizabeth Warren is at best (possibly) 1/64 Native American.  8 Ã— 8 = 64  white supremacist Nazis in BOTH parties to more effectively oppress POC  ....Nazis, hiding in plain sight https://t.co/yeUujNSFSt
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Why not "Have a pow wow with Liz?" Or, "Drink fire water with Warren?" Embrace your Native American culture. According to HuffPo, lots of Native Americans support your claims. https://t.co/m1ZJHXxAWQ
C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker Dayton's shooter was a cultist, satan worshipper, as well as an Elizabeth Warren follower.  The baseball shooter was a Bernie bro.  What did you say again about white supremacists?
C: (0.904%) T: The Dayton shooter may have been far left, but you know what? Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have never chuckled at the suggestion that people be shot. Neither have used hateful language against people in Dayton. Or anywhere. It's not equivalent to Trump's hatred and racism
C: (0.998%) T: @LisPower1 The  Dayton shooter is a left wing Elizabeth Warren supporter  fact . The animal is El Paso Who slaughtered innocent souls Said Trump had nothing to do with his sick cause and thatâ€™s a fact
C: (1.000%) T: Is Bernie responsible for the shooting at the congressional baseball practice? Is Elizabeth warren responsible for the shooting in Dayton, Ohio? Was Barack Obama responsible for the shooting at the Dallas police officers? https://t.co/p2QgdoDl1o
C: (1.000%) T: @Styx666Official 88....Elizabeth Warren is at best (possibly) 1/64 Native American.  8 Ã— 8 = 64  white supremacist Nazis in BOTH parties to more effectively oppress POC  ....Nazis, hiding in plain sight https://t.co/tqIhcUyTlh
C: (1.000%) T: Iâ€™m a teacher preparing for the upcoming school year and I have a simple request: @ewarren will you be my teacher mentor?! I want to learn from the best of the best ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž  https://t.co/V9b4MqyBzQ
C: (0.500%) T: @FlashGo56556854 @JoaquinCastrotx Hmm. Where is your hashtag for the massacre Elizabeth Warren inspired in Dayton??
C: (0.988%) T: Dayton Mass Murderer Was a Socialist Democrat Who Loved Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders https://t.co/WSXZy2AM6H
C: (1.000%) T: @Edwardpedroza2 @Manny_Funes @TomiLahren Ha you're right the last attack in OH was a pro gun Elizabeth Warren supporter. Oh &amp; may want to try &amp; forget 9/11 but over 3000 people where MURDERED MORE THAN EVERY MASS SHOOTING IN THE LAST FEW YEARS COMBINED! GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE SAND
C: (1.000%) T: One of the shooters was a left extremist who quoted Elizabeth Warren. So instead of playing the blame game you really need to help educate your fan base and use your popularity for a good reason. https://t.co/KufjIbP0IJ
C: (1.000%) T: So was Hillary Clinton so where is Bob Joe Biden Obama Bill Clinton Elizabeth Warren Amelia Harris every candidate that you wasn't even running for president has a dark pass.  look at all the laws that the Democratic candidates have been caught in and show a champ he's probably https://t.co/dDfLdsxdaH
