C: (1.000%) T: @atrupar @rezaaslan Hey genius when u have thousands of people coming to your border with the intention of illegally entering the Country that indeed is an invasion. Blaming Trump for EL Paso is the same as blaming Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for Dayton since that nut supported them.
C: (1.000%) T: Twitter feed shows Dayton shooter was leftist and supported Elizabeth Warren  https://t.co/2IoSJtqyGv
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren pretended to be a Native American for political gain. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @callonzach Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris understand politics and procedure better than Bernie Sanders does. Bernie Sanders understands how to kickstart a grassroots movement that can move an entire major party to the left, which he successfully did. It is now time for the next stage.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren committed racial fraud to gain admission to Harvard. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @Conservativeind Not Elizabeth Warren.  In all honestly, of the ones I know of, I could probably have a beer with Tulsi Gabbard or Andrew Yang.
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren @nessa_jellybean Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a c*nt. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @jjweddell @JeffSun84249944 @MattWilt803 @NateSilver538 They haven't been on the same debate stage yet. She's going to run circles around him. And has ammo from their past.  https://t.co/mblcX62UND
C: (1.000%) T: @tribbleday @VoteBlueNow @Hollow_Raven @AndrewHClark @BetoORourke I'm only stuck on one candidate and that's Elizabeth Warren I have no idea what her religious beliefs are because she doesn't put it out there as the forefront of her politics.  Not sure why you brought religion into this?
C: (1.000%) T: @ArthurSchwartz I did not donate $10 to Elizabeth Warren's campaign for her to to buy a cup of lemonade!...wait..nvm...I didn't donate $ to @ewarren ... carry on.
C: (0.988%) T: @maliciousglee the 1.5 seconds it took me to realize you weren’t referring to Elizabeth Warren was a rollercoaster
C: (1.000%) T: @GeneGillies @Calderon08 @badlandz_MaLa @AliVelshi But there’s old white guys running now tho. Joe Biden believed bussing was perfectly fine. Elizabeth warren faked her ancestry to go to college for free. Trump fucking sucks and is racist and kamala harris hides evidence that could exonerate ppl from prison.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a lying, America hating, commie. It took her whole life to finally admit she was white. She doesn’t know her ass from her elbow. She’s a national disgrace and will never be President.
C: (0.999%) T: @BlackIrishI @ewarren Actually Elizabeth Warren is a con artist that’s not real smart.
C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro “So I’m like a reporter, and I was just walking down a random street in Harlan, and gosh darn wouldn’t you know it there’s Elizabeth Warren buyin’ some lemonade with a $10 campaign contribution. ‘Keep the change comrade.  There’s more where that came from’ she says to the teen.”
C: (1.000%) T: @MattMurchison @mwolfers Add Elizabeth Warren to that he’d love to run against her too. Let me give you a preview. Sleepy Joe, Crazy Bernie and of course. Pocahontas Warren. Can’t you see it ?
C: (1.000%) T: @BigBadBaba1 @TrumperSeaney @realDonaldTrump @CNN @CBS i heard he was an elizabeth warren nut and kinda checked out after that. "figures" was all i thought.
C: (0.974%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether the nut-job Elizabeth Warren is a lying, crazy, ass-wipe.  I said yes.
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/Dr1UVjdhNY
C: (1.000%) T: @SebGorka Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren’s real name was Lieawatha, and I said yes. She was named after her lying “Native American” mother.
C: (1.000%) T: @Minturner11 @21stCenturyFDR @Gacheeta94 @Jasonfest No need for insults to achieve the truth: https://t.co/qmQm4HPIhE Sorry, just keeping it real. If you find an article of Sanders being inserted into a race to block a progressive, send me the link.
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren eats her boogers. I said yes. #IsaidYes
C: (1.000%) T: lmao Elizabeth Warren's social media director and I were fb friends bc we went to high school together, and she kept digging up old fb posts I made when I was 15 and commenting on them, so I unfriended her. And that's why I don't plan on voting for Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Des Moines growth and development reporter “just happened” to come across Elizabeth Warren buying lemonade in Harlan. Here is how far Harlan is from Des Moines. ⬇️. https://t.co/0DSxvm4d68
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Umm well today I was asked is Elizabeth warren a satanist. I said yes!
