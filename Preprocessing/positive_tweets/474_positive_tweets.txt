C: (1.000%) T: HIDDEN  MEANING  Okay, but, when the gov. provides it, the gov. will control it. The gov. will also censor it. There's that dangling socialist carrot again called "free stuff." Just remember, it has a fishhook in it.  So, no, thanks, "Liz." (#Censorship) https://t.co/uoOf2kMVSP

C: (1.000%) T: @SHeLLY_oBRieN35 @ewarren Shawn are u aware the 5 Indian tribes captured bought &amp; sold black people as slaves. Strange how they think it is only white people but fact it was Democrat who were slavemasters not republicans. Elizabeth Warren Identifies both Indians &amp; Democrats. Rather telling dont you think?
C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren calls Trump a white supremacist https://t.co/13xu9uhR7i  He was talking about the issue (of statue removal) which CAUSED the protests. He said "there are very fine people on both sides (of the issue)". He did NOT say Nazis or white supremacists were fine people!!
C: (1.000%) T: You know who Elizabeth Warren is?  Elizabeth Warren is a one upper.  That friend who never likes to see you doing good and always has to try to show you up.  That's exactly who she is. https://t.co/bN1MkaUUpX

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren If Trump's a White Supremacist... I wonder if he ever exploited any race and stole their money the way Elizabeth Warren did to the Cherokee?

C: (0.904%) T: @SenWarren These shootings had nothing to do with anything more than mentally ill individuals. You make me sick!!!! It is.  People like you that keeps strife within this country. SHAME ON. YOU ELIZABETH WARREN. YOU need to be stopped.
C: (1.000%) T: @FactsMatterNow @Wonderbitch81 @Ange_Amene @blackwomenviews @ReginaA1981 @oREGINAl49ers @_deviantartstan @WillieEverstop @WolvesforKamala @a_for2day @Corbinburnsin @chrislongview @chrisdameanor19 @Mrchmadnes @Beer_til_mornin @eclecticbrotha I’m nervous about the cable stations pumping up Elizabeth Warren in Iowa. I don’t want to think of her putting Sander’s on her ticket, but they have been hanging close. Ideally, I want Harris/Castro. Kamala shouldn’t &amp; wouldn’t be VP to Warren! Warren needs the Black vote though!
C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano Very true, I also agree that he’s a bad candidate. However, if it’s between him and Trump, I’m voting for Biden.  To be clear— my first choice is Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @Moski1213 @marcushjohnson Not true for me. Now it's more of an Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris thing and Bernie now comes 3rd.

C: (1.000%) T: A Bernie bro came to my door to canvas and when I said I support Elizabeth Warren he said "oh...um, well OK." And left.   He didn't even... try?
