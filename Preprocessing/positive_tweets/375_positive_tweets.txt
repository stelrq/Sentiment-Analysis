C: (0.988%) T: DEMOCRATS ARE IN LINE W/ RADICALS OF ALL STRIPES.  THE KILLER IN DAYTON WAS AN ELIZABETH WARREN/BERNIE SANDERS ADVOCATE &amp; THE ONE IN TEXAS WAS A SOCIALIST.  MAXINE WATERS IS ONE OF THE MOST HATEFUL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS - ALCOFF &amp; THOSE LIKE HIM ARE MINDLESS FOLLOWERS OF THAT HATE. https://t.co/9ov5QsQ0jB
C: (0.988%) T: Joe Biden is only six years older than Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/UJflQYEEF5
C: (0.984%) T: Is Elizabeth Warren president yet?
C: (0.987%) T: @Naname1961 @realDonaldTrump Yeah. Leave those Elizabeth Warren supporters around to shoot up all they want.
C: (1.000%) T: @DenaeEdgeEdge @mlcreader time to remember the quip Bill Clinton often used  Don't let perfection be the enemy of good.  Having said that,  Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete are brilliant articulate spokepersons on their feet, and will make excellent leaders of the Executive federal branch in Jan 2021
C: (0.729%) T: @MonmouthPoll @Lawrence I hope Elizabeth Warren listens Medicare for all will get another 4 years of hell with Trump üò∞

C: (1.000%) T: @KurtSchlichter Hey Elizabeth Warren what‚Äôs your answer when they ask if Joe Biden is a white supremacist
C: (0.775%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked who is Elizabeth Warren, and I said, "A racist nobody!"  You're welcome! #TruthHurts #Pocahontas
C: (1.000%) T: America‚Äôs best bet to get Trump out of office at this point is Elizabeth Warren whether we like it or not
C: (0.994%) T: @SRuhle Was this a surprise to anyone? Certainly not to Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.997%) T: @KimNorvellDMR Elizabeth Warren is part of a party that was founded by the KKK. So it sounds like she is projecting.
C: (1.000%) T: #dropoutbiden get out of the way, endorse Elizabeth Warren and/or Bernie Sanders. https://t.co/ztviLhhgfc
C: (0.568%) T: Due to a recent incident encounter with a mosquito, scientists have confirmed Elizabeth Warren is now back to being 100% white https://t.co/4GD69iNqUh
C: (1.000%) T: I've not been a big fan of Elizabeth Warren, and I think some of the "blue sky" progressive platform, while having laudable goals, is unachievable in four years due to cost. However, I'm beginning to really like her "I Have a Plan for That" approach...tomorrow, gun reforms.
C: (0.980%) T: @Dewestmusic243 The Dayton shooter was Elizabeth Warren fan in a Bernie Sanders fan. I was born in Dayton Ohio lived there most of my life. The Oregon district was poor and then it got revamped.
C: (0.999%) T: Democrats are giving a cold shoulder to Sen. Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs proposed wealth tax, one of the centerpieces of her presidential campaign.  The Massachusetts... https://t.co/nOVfHKDZMy
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @LynnBarnett8 @ewarren At this point there are several good choices, Elizabeth Warren being an attorney at least has a sound knowledge of the law. As opposed to President Trump who thinks he knows everything, but how much does he really know?
C: (1.000%) T: The more people see and hear Elizabeth Warren the more they like her. The media publishes stories about "electability" and ignore, competence, intelligence, commitment, the issues and America.  Don't be a stooge for these fake elitist privileged goons and their bosses.
C: (1.000%) T: @ResistPres @Ganulvian @louiseh_b @tammytabby @ewarren @senatemajldr How come no one is talking about the Dayton Ohio shooter who was a self proclaimed leftist &amp; supported Elizabeth Warren? It must of been her use of words that caused him to shoot &amp; kill innocent people. She should be held liable for his actions! Just like they are doing to Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: I'm not a Biden fan but I was VERY impressed by his speech the other day following the two shootings. He is now on my active radar for possible candidate to support. I still favor Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete. Elizabeth Warren is gaining in my estimation as well.
C: (1.000%) T: @Crimsoncatt @Dahntahn7 @JonathanBSmall @peterdaou Desperate - lol. Pretty sure that's Elizabeth Warren you see gaining on you all. I'd be happy with a President Warren. There's never going to be a President Sanders though. That ship has sailed. Every time someone attacks Biden as an "old, white, man" - they attack Bernie too. https://t.co/nXGlgnQIUp
C: (1.000%) T: @MichaelAvenatti @Zach_Graumann @AndrewYang That's the kind of tweet person desperate for attention sends. Not exactly inspiring leadership. Unlike Joe Biden &amp; Elizabeth Warren, who direct their anger &amp; criticism towards Trump, where it belongs.Yang will continue to flail about unless he gets  more focused like them. ‚öñ‚ù§Ô∏è
C: (1.000%) T: @CindyKendrick11 Oh no Elizabeth Warren thinks he‚Äôs a white supremacist.   The earth will cease to exist.
C: (1.000%) T: -Democratic Party. White girl. Wasn‚Äôt Amy Klobuchar, her name was Liz.  -Elizabeth Warren? -Elizabeth Warren!
