C: (0.989%) T: @WadeDefinitely The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Do you want to start there? I don't blame her, but everyone wants to blame Trump for the El Paso shooting so, why not?
C: (1.000%) T: @kirkketchum @JefreyHamilton @FrankConniff Bernie didn't give Donald Trump a standing ovation that was Elizabeth Warren. #BernieBeatsTrump in Texas

C: (1.000%) T: "In just a few minutes, Warren displayed a multitude of characteristics I believe a president should possess including empathy, curiosity, attention to detail and a willingness to help." When Elizabeth Warren Kindly Ignored That I Smelled Like Vomit https://t.co/fyg7HMqiIr
C: (0.546%) T: Wonder what will be the repercussions of Warren and Harris igniting the smoldering spark that nearly burned Ferguson to the ground. The desperation of these 2 Dems is palpable...their tweets reprehensible. Heaven help them‼️  #DemPartyOfHateAndLies‼️ https://t.co/jjVPE1h4u4
C: (1.000%) T: What do you call a very white person( Elizabeth Warren ) who used an actual down cast race for her personal gain both politically and financially ??? I call that person a “REAL” racist !!!
C: (1.000%) T: I really, really want Elizabeth Warren to be President. I look forward to casting my early ballot in CA for her. I think Warren can beat Trump. But if I were picking who would give me a Total Victory in a general election, Harris seems like the right answer.
C: (1.000%) T: I couldn’t possibly agree with Elizabeth Warren on this subject than I already do. https://t.co/KEyVl2ZeG4

C: (1.000%) T: @TrueEyeTheSpy Wonders will never cease. We all know how far left Yahoo! is. Well, today they called out Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren for the lies they've told the public about Ferguson, Mo. I was shocked. Yahoo! never sticks up for Patriots.
C: (1.000%) T: @gtconway3d Who Then is a good man? The sodomite and rapist William Jefferson Clinton? The race baiting Al Sharpton coddling Barack Hussein Obama?

C: (1.000%) T: @NathanLerner What healthcare plan? He never once gave even a thought of how he would reshape healthcare. You must be a very shallow thinker. Check out Elizabeth Warren. SHE has a PLAN!
C: (1.000%) T: I'm thinking she may be the one! Biden's a good guy but we need someone who knows the system well who is intellectually driven, has good common sense, knows the law, and has a compassionate heart! Elizabeth Warren Rocks for the PEOPLE❗️ https://t.co/cMt7GHJOuK
C: (1.000%) T: @CA49thDistrict @BernieSanders OOOOOH, Ruuuuusssssians. Fuckers, Clinton should have been disqualified for destruction of gov documents by law, OUR LAW. Get the fuck outta here.
