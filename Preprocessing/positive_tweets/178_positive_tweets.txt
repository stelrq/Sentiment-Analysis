C: (0.897%) T: @tribelaw And what about the mass shooting by a supporter of Elizabeth Warren....do you blame her for her rhetoric against the people her supporter felt encouraged to save the country from?  If you don‚Äôt apply your logic equally to both sides, you‚Äôre irrational.

C: (1.000%) T: As is true with all ‚Äúcapitalist to my bones‚Äù Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs plans, there is a market waiver, loopholes and a pragmatist logic, but no structural or even moderate change.
