C: (1.000%) T: #PWPoePrompts Day 8 Non-bookish follows:   ✨NASA and anything science related, specially astrophysics  ✨Philippine culture-related peeps including journalists, artists, and The Aswang Project  ✨Politicians I support: Elizabeth Warren and AOC ✨A few celebs for fun
C: (1.000%) T: As far as I can tell, Elizabeth Warren is the only 2020 primary candidate with sustained upward movement in the polling averages. If we're attempting to forecast future changes this fact makes her a precent decent pick...
C: (0.940%) T: @RepKarenBass AOC is responsible for the man trying to fire bomb a ice office in the state of Washington. She may not have made it but her hand was on the detonator. She needs to assume responsibility. The shooter in Dayton was a Elizabeth Warren follower she needs to assume responsibility.
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill Elizabeth Warren is a well established liar. She lied about her heritage attempting to steal the heritage of Native Americans so she could gain some perceived advantage she thought they are entitled to. In my book that makes her a white supremacist of the worst kind.
C: (0.983%) T: @GeraldoRivera @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump Is @SenWarren @ewarren responsible for the Ohio shooter? https://t.co/e8wGETAHIV
C: (1.000%) T: @DomRobins0n @conscious_sis @SergeantMac95 @DalphonMy @msenicaracing @keithboykin I don’t know, why don’t you ask the Elizabeth Warren supporter that shot up Dayton.... and this isn’t about defending Trump. He says a lot of stupid things and needs to shut his mouth. But the other side are not doing themselves any favors.
C: (1.000%) T: @PressBeet Is it beginning? Already excluding the best candidate? Elizabeth Warren obviously
C: (0.995%) T: @arnoldxaka @realDonaldTrump The shooter in Dayton was an active socialist and Elizabeth Warren supporter...
C: (0.559%) T: @4YrsToday The left is completely against cultural appropriation:  -Rachael Dolezol -Sean King -Elizabeth Warren -Robert Francis O’Rourk
C: (1.000%) T: @SteveKornacki I am a big Elizabeth Warren fan and want her to be our nominee. I was in my car when VP Biden spoke. He was amazing. Please,get down to no more than 5 candidates and tell us what you will do to lead. To denigrate the others on the stage while we have a monster in the WH is wrong.
C: (1.000%) T: DSA endorsing Warren is different than DSA members voting (or not voting) for the democratic nominee. I LIKE Elizabeth Warren &amp; will vote for her if she’s the nominee. But we are not going to endorse, as a body, someone who believes capitalism can be better if we only try harder
C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist https://t.co/fLQ5uO42Rv
C: (0.977%) T: Elizabeth Warren outlines sweeping new gun control plans  https://t.co/Lnfwt3YZjy
C: (0.793%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren lies.  She is well aware that the Obama Justice Dept produced a 86 page paper clearing the police officer.
C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 You do realize that both mass shooters in El Paso and Ohio identified themselves as leftists? The guy in Ohio even had written he had planned on voting for Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @heatsand These things are equivalent how, exactly? Elizabeth Warren buying lemonade is standard politician stuff. All politicians holds babies and shake hands and take selfies. Trump's actions are an entirely different level and you know it.
C: (0.989%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a new plan to reduce gun violence by 80 percent https://t.co/DpwDnk1JLU #SmartNews
C: (1.000%) T: I'm very glad that Elizabeth Warren has an action plan to curb him violence, but I am very depressed by the fact that there was probably a sticky note on the folder that said "release after next large firearm massacre."
C: (0.996%) T: @trifonovg1 @NRO It will require that because as it stands right now it has more holes in it than an Elizabeth Warren policy statement.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the most wholesome person in the entire country and I want her to adopt me https://t.co/qGaUx4IQW9

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. - TheBlaze https://t.co/EdTg76LQlT
C: (0.992%) T: Oh so you’re going to turn a blind eye to the FACT that the Ohio shooter was a self proclaimed satanist, socialist, and an explicit Elizabeth Warren supporter?? I know you only said in 2018, but c’mon, Alexandria Occasionally-retarded Cortez. Instead of dividing this country— https://t.co/Ic9rnlvqBQ
C: (1.000%) T: @scott_tobias But you believe Elizabeth Warren actually stopped at a kids’ lemonade stand just to get a drink? I’m sure it was set up to be photographed too.
C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wants to sharply increase taxes on guns and ammunition as part of a comprehensive new plan to reduce gun deaths in the United States by 80%.  Wow, she is a busy bunny! She has more plans than "Carter has little liver pills"! (Excuse old expression)
