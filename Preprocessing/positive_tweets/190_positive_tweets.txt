C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson I like Elizabeth Warren and I'd be totally retweeting complaints and criticisms and very vocal if a professional on MSNBC, in the course of their job as a paid professional in media, said something very unprofessional about Warren, like that their skin was crawling or something.

C: (1.000%) T: It‚Äôs not only Kamala Harris claiming Brown was ‚Äúmurdered.‚Äù Elizabeth Warren is saying the same thing. Meanwhile, the Washington Post carried a highly sympathetic piece Saturday about Wilson‚Äôs false accuser.
