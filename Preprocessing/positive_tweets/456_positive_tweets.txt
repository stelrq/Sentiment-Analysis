C: (1.000%) T: Biden is no Bernie Sanders. Biden is no Elizabeth Warren. Biden is no Mayor Pete. Biden is no Corey Booker Biden is no Beto. Biden is no Kamala. Biden is no Andrew Yang. Trump will eat him alive in a debate. Can we afford to let that happen?
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery Are you shitting me right now? Do you know who Elizabeth Warren is? You canâ€™t get any more genuine than her. tRump only cares about his own narcissistic self AND IT SHOWS.
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery The El Paso shooter really likes Trump.  The victims not so much.  I'll take Elizabeth Warren. Smart, trustworthy and genuine.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is white. I said yes. #Pocahontas  #LIAR
C: (1.000%) T: @Alysson Itâ€™s feasible that Joe could catch up to current day. But Elizabeth Warren is up to speed, has engaged voters nationwide, and has presented plans to address practically every societal problem.
C: (1.000%) T: @MarkDice And today also I was asked by a friend if Elizabeth Warren was a dumbass and I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @VaughnHillyard @JaxAlemany Donâ€™t overthink it bud, thatâ€™s the mistake. Itâ€™s not a personality contest. Vote for anyone not currently in office, anyone who isnâ€™t a terrorist radicalizing, planet destroying fascist spoiled little rich boy who was never taught right from wrong. Elizabeth Warren will do - ty!
C: (1.000%) T: @SenGillibrand Iâ€™ve seen you pander and youâ€™re good but not Elizabeth Warren or Kampala Harris good.
C: (1.000%) T: @KumarsSalehi @ztsamudzi Absences of social/economic justice shows why Bernie supporters are so hostile to ideas of reparations, black feminist theory (i.e. intersectional anaysis), etc. Polls show majority of his supporters would support Joe Biden before they would Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: People who like Sanders say they support him because of things like Medicare 4 All. Well, Elizabeth Warren not only supports that, but she would be better able to implement it.
C: (0.747%) T: Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren both need to be charged with in-sighting to riot, they both have published accounts of what they call is a murder and is a total complete absolute lie and does nothing but tend to infuriate and inflame the The public
C: (1.000%) T: Hey Richard Fowler why haven't you been pursuing this narrative for the last 5 years why are you only giving opinion now the Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren brought it back the light for no reason other than political
C: (1.000%) T: @jbrandonmeeks True. I saw an ad from Elizabeth Warren this morning, in which she said she drinks Michelob Ultra. I don't know much about her, and now I don't want to...
C: (1.000%) T: There you go Martha another Democratic friend Richard Fowler who you know is going to fit your narrative for the Democratic party that we must push this thing that we have to bring up something that took place years ago before Trump the Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: I canâ€™t believe Elizabeth warren and kamala Harris with there views on Ferguson. They have no idea what they are talking about. They donâ€™t live in St. Louis maybe have never been here.  They are so uninformed
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Finally, a Dem admits that 'if you want less of something, tax it!'  All of you working class &amp; poor people out there, you should know that Elizabeth Warren doesn't think you are worthy enough to exercise your right to self-defence.  Only the wealthy are so entitled.
C: (1.000%) T: Hey Kamala Harris in response to your Tweet on Michael Brown that you and Elizabeth Warren feel that it's necessary to bring up the Saviour losing campaign what do you mean by racial equity don't you mean Racial equality
C: (1.000%) T: Karmala Harris &amp; Elizabeth Warren are murdering the truth. The Obama justice Department determined Michael Brown was not murdered yet Harris &amp; Warren claim he was. Anything for votes. Not fit for president.
C: (1.000%) T: ðŸ’™  Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren cross paths and hug in Iowa.   https://t.co/x4IeQYtzrf
C: (0.536%) T: @ewarren Michael Brown was killed by an officer that was defending himself against an angry man the try to get his gun. Elizabeth Warren you are ignorant and you are a liar.
C: (1.000%) T: I hope at the end of the Democratic primaries, candidates NOT chosen, such as if Bernie Sanders or Tom Steyer or Joe Biden do not get the nomination, or if Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris or Kirsten Gillibrand do not get nominated, will campaign for the Democrat who DID win.
C: (1.000%) T: Sen Elizabeth Warren proposes $85 billion 'public option' for internet https://t.co/OEVgYuCmNB
C: (0.779%) T: @FaceTheNation @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren was responsible for the Dayton shooting &amp; Bernie Sanders was responsible for the man who tried to kill all the Republicanâ€™s! But thatâ€™s President Trumpâ€™s fault!  How about placing the blame on the Media who spew hate all the time! Blood is on their hands!!
C: (1.000%) T: Love Elizabeth Warren she has real sunday school teacher energy very positive
C: (0.987%) T: @westtexastp @SonnyTheGreat_ The native Elizabeth Warren.
