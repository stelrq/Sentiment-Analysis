C: (0.998%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a criminal who misrepresented her ethnicity and defrauded the taxpayers in order to advance her career. She belongs in the big wigwam with iron bars.
C: (1.000%) T: @jpriestj @prageru correct me if I'm wrong but Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren &amp; the squad pretty all signed up for that socialists convention, if that doesn't make them socialist I don't know what would.
C: (1.000%) T: @JDtheFast @TheMediaLiesToU @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren wants to introduce a billionaire tax to fund it. Even if you are against that, I donâ€™t mind student loan forgiveness if we both ensure that this does not happen again and people who DIDNâ€™T rack up student loan debt get to share in this plan.
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister Joe Biden has lost his step. Heâ€™s likable but a poor campaigner. Thatâ€™s not enough to beat Trump. We need a fighter like Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN There was amass shooting in Ohio also Oh I get it that shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter so that gets swept under the rug
C: (1.000%) T: I won't vote for Bernie Sanders. I won't vote for Joe Biden. I won't vote for Kamala Harris. I will vote for Elizabeth Warren.  In the Democratic Primary.   That being said, who ever wins the nomination, I WILL vote Blue.  Trump can't have 4 more yrs. Hope everyone is on board.
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister Elizabeth Warren has the best plan.  She is fearless.   Warren 2020ðŸŒŠ
C: (1.000%) T: @DrEtiquette Prime example of the Wrap up smear â›”You only need to look!â›”  â›”Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris both knowingly Slandered/Lied about a proven Innocent Police Officer for MURDER, for political points and $$â›” How much lower can a person go???  How can they live with themselves
C: (1.000%) T: @Dax_x98 We stan one woman in this race and her name is Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @PeopleMatter9 @DemGovs Robert Francis  O'Rourke should just give up now...seriously you are making a joke of yourself. BTW I am latino and find you biting off our hispanic heritage with your FAKE NICKNAME is exactly like ELIZABETH WARREN...stop pandering and go back to music.
C: (0.726%) T: @ketchum_phil @ewarren Elizabeth Warren will have the black vote at any cost, and if a riot ensues then bye George, a riot ensues.
C: (1.000%) T: Look Elizabeth Warren may have spent thirty years larping as Native American, but the cultural appropriation I really won't stand for, is the inclusion of "socialist" iconography on her posters.
C: (1.000%) T: @saletan @SykesCharlie Why arenâ€™t you calling out all of Trumpâ€™s lies and false accusations? Are you just so overwhelmed by how many there are that you need to focus on Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s one?
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren YOUR HOUSE under someone like Elizabeth Warren.  Socialists love to confiscate YOUR PROPERTY! Just look at her tweet. Denying an American Family their right to keep their hard earned &amp; risk taking money! Thatâ€™s NOT FREEDOM ðŸ˜¡ https://t.co/RsdN1yzY5M
C: (0.986%) T: @outandaboutjc1 @Gunalizer @TrickyRickDaddy @MattBors So you think Elizabeth Warren isn't an identity politics nutjob?
C: (0.995%) T: Warren is on the rise!  #Warren2020 https://t.co/qVA2Pe5wov
C: (1.000%) T: I believe deep in my heart that Elizabeth Warren should and will be our next president, but these pictures are... testing me. https://t.co/qHIHCNtDgv
C: (1.000%) T: @naturalgr00wer @TerrDonCantrell @FxEpic @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump @Twitter @senatemajldr Leftists denounce the Ohio shooter, but attribute him to 'white nationalism' when he in fact was a leftist Elizabeth Warren-supporter. No Democrat pres candidate has denounced Antifa, even after the Ice-firebombing, and the Ohio-shooting, both Antifa inspired/members.
C: (1.000%) T: @mattyglesias Counterpoint: Elizabeth Warren.  Do I wish she were 15 years younger? OK, yes, I do. Do I find the fact that she's 70 disqualifying? No, I certainly don't.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren agrees with you: your internet is not very good. But can her newly released plan to fix it actually work? KarlBode explores. https://t.co/EsqIJMg4Ai
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today, I was asked if I thought any sane human being would actually consider voting for Elizabeth Warren.  I said he'll fucking NO!!!
C: (0.824%) T: @Josemor11350147 @GOP @realDonaldTrump The Ohio shooter didn't have a manifesto where he specifically referenced Elizabeth Warren's racist rhetoric like the El Paso shooter did with Trump.
C: (0.611%) T: @askariali @Walmart You didn't mention the psycho in Dayton who was an Elizabeth Warren fan. Hmmm, of course you forgot that
C: (1.000%) T: New from @patrynard: Our Iowa hitchhiking tour with the candidates continue. See why Kirsten Gillibrand was so happy yesterday, and what's new (or not) with Elizabeth Warren's pitch #IACaucus https://t.co/3FcIh9VguD
C: (1.000%) T: @R_Yucha @EricMcDowell1 @Lady_Historian @JoeBiden Honest question - how much do you think the Cherokee DNA thing will hurt Elizabeth Warren? In either the primary or general?
