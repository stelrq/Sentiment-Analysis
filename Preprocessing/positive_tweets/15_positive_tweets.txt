C: (1.000%) T: Was it a fundraising email? Yes. But I feel I need to stress that Elizabeth Warren wrote my name on her wall. Y'all better believe I threw her $15 without thinking. I've given small donations to political candidates… https://t.co/6N6VkHeqj1

C: (1.000%) T: @musingsofmegan @TomiLahren Mind boggling too is how silent your side is on the Dayton shooting since it was discovered that he followed Elizabeth Warren and a lot of the Democratic policies.
