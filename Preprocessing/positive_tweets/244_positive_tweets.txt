C: (1.000%) T: @MarkDice @RoArquette Good idea it worked for what's her face.  Or she could be Native American like Elizabeth Warren.  Fear not white princess!
C: (0.940%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ You still would have protected his rights to an assault weapon.  Elizabeth Warren didn't call any group of people infestation, murderers. Those are still your constituents Trump was referring to.

C: (0.997%) T: No, Elizabeth Warren, YOU are the white supremacist. A stereotypical Dem/Left white supremacist climbing over the bodies of Native Americans to get ahead of them in line and usurp a placement meant for them, not you. And you know that. https://t.co/8nCICM895x

Not a thing. Read this morning that "top Dems" warming to the idea of Elizabeth Warren as the nominee due to Biden's debate performances. Elizabeth Warren will not win
C: (0.996%) T: @SaraCarterDC  News Alert: Did AOC ask Elizabeth Warren? "When you were an Indian, did you kill Buffaloes for their little wings?"
C: (1.000%) T: @emigre80 I am very excited by Elizabeth Warren.  She is a woman.  She was not born with a silver spoon in her mouth.  She stuggled.  She is a teacher.  She has plans/articulates those plans.  Her plans can work.  She has guts/is not afraid.  I am excited about her.  Jmo, nothing more.
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Elizabeth Warren and CNN wouldn‚Äôt know the truth if it was staring them in the face.  This unrelenting dishonesty and gaslighting is truly unbelievable.

C: (1.000%) T: @joanne_mulenex @ResisterDoggie Are you the Elizabeth Warren type native American? I am a US citizen, so this is my country of origin. As for my ancestors, they entered legally as well. Native Americans' ancestors also came to this land from somewhere else too. I believe the origin of humanity is Africa, so????

C: (0.997%) T: @sparktherevolt @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Why do you hate capitalism?   The average hospital stay costs $10,000. Elizabeth Warren is a little more concerned about that than 7 cups of $1 lemonade.
