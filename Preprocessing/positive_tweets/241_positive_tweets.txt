C: (1.000%) T: @IBtalking @cspanwj Well we know a Left wing Elizabeth Warren supporter commited the shooting in Dayton.....and a Left wing Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assasinate the entire Republican Congress.....  ......I assume you also pin the blame for those shootings on Bernie and Pocahantas right?
C: (0.739%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have NEVER chuckled when a supporter yells that we should shoot immigrants or been quiet when supporters have yelled that POC should be kicked out of the country.  Guess who has?  You racist old fuck.
C: (0.985%) T: @littledeekay @realDonaldTrump @OANN Oops- A Twitter account appearing to be from the gunman who killed nine people in Dayton, Ohio, showed tweets labeling himself a “leftist,” bemoaning the election of President Donald Trump, supporting Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @Loripacker19438 @WashTimes it is when you wear riot gear and carry weapons, dayton shooter was an antifa thug elizabeth warren supporter (and before u call me a racist, i hate the kkk unfortunately even the aclu says those very small # of losers have a right to assemble)
C: (1.000%) T: Also a must listen interview in which I just want to give Liz a hug. As one student said, “Wonder Woman wishes she could be Elizabeth Warren.”
C: (1.000%) T: Love love love this piece on @ewarren. I’m ready to be in President Warren’s classroom. https://t.co/xxR78ufYTV
C: (0.988%) T: @rezaaslan So if you support Elizabeth Warren, you support the Dayton Shooter?
C: (1.000%) T: @Wil_Johnson1 @gatewaypundit With that logic is Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders triggered the shooting in Ohio?!
C: (1.000%) T: So they believe that Maxine Waters, Pelosi, the Squad, Elizabeth Warren, and on and on..are going to decide who red flag laws apply to? They can pass all the laws they want, I will not comply. This is my line in the sand. https://t.co/JP19fRRpHb
C: (0.986%) T: @brianstelter 100% TRUE AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT. MORE DEMOCRAT LIBERAL LIES TO HIDE THE FACT BOTH SHOOTERS ARE WHITE LIBERALS. Dayton shooter loved Elizabeth Warren &amp; hated Pres Trump. And El Paso shooter was a eco-terrorist and hated President Trump. WE KNOW THE TRUTH.... https://t.co/3QGeMpgiym
C: (0.989%) T: Tucker Carlson is right, do we have a leftist problem that the Dayton Ohio shooter supported Elizabeth Warren &amp; ANTIFA or do we blame Bernie for a supporter in Alexandria targeted GOP or do we blame The Vegas shooter that targeted conservatives at a concert on liberals? Nope
C: (1.000%) T: @LionOHo @JeanPau16735059 @BreitbartNews His point is if you were being honest, you wouldn’t blame president Trump as having had a direct influence on the shooter. Did Bernie Sanders have a direct influence on a shooter? Elizabeth Warren? Why wouldn’t you blame BHO’s rhetoric &amp; attacks on LEO? We could do this all day.

C: (1.000%) T: @FailsEveryWeek @DStewart541 @NuritBaytch @iamthespookster The Dayton shooter was a registered Democrat that supported Elizabeth Warren. Or so a few of the online news forums said.
C: (0.987%) T: @tylord9 @ClayTravis who couldn't get laid and yeah was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. The difference is so fucking astronomical but of course Clay Travis can't figure this one out
C: (0.503%) T: @chrisonchris @MailOnline In other breaking news:  Elizabeth Warren opened her mail this morning.
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC u just reported that the @DNC has pretty much 'selected' elizabeth warren as their nominee.  gee, color me naive, but i thought the american people selected the nominee through the voting process.  the dnc is yet again shunning the only person who can beat trump...sanders.
