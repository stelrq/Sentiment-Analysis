C: (1.000%) T: @TrancewithEmma @Swishavenue @kasiersouse @ninaland Not true. IF you research it, she upheld current law that allowed 2 more than the usual treatment, which didn't cover re-assignment. which varied for both. In the end one or both got it and she even assisted in the process.  Yes, Warren was anti-trans. https://t.co/aQCabwgw4K

C: (1.000%) T: @SenGillibrand @CNN  @FoxNews  @secupp @AriFleischer @brithume @MittRomney    I will give you a dollar if you tweet and ask Elizabeth warren about her dishonesty - when for decades she pretended to be a woman of color and accepted awards and tenure as a minority faculty.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a TERRORIST and I said, YES!. her followers love to go out and &amp; kill people.  She's very proud of them. https://t.co/8WjNBo7z5P
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is a native American and I say only 1/1024  yes.
C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to invest an additional $200 billion in rural communities and place a focus on sustainable farming practices. https://t.co/YVQXtMr0pp
C: (1.000%) T: FYI: The Dayton Shooter Was Pro-Antifa and Wanted to Vote For Elizabeth Warren Guess that’s why you don’t hear much about Dayton! Doesn’t fit Democrats narrative! https://t.co/TIv7j5x1ca
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC Yeah. He was a leftist and a supporter of Antifa and Elizabeth Warren. It’s the progressive ideology that caused these people to be killed. Right?
C: (0.892%) T: @courierjournal Democrats and the lying, hateful, fake news needs to stop fueling hate and racism. These shooters had nothing to do with President Trump or his views but they sure did support the Democratic views and 1 supported Elizabeth Warren. Report the truth. #StopTheHate
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Fox to OANN your news sources are getting worse, less credible. Highly likely he wasn’t a Elizabeth Warren supporter. He had a history of misogyny.. Warren is a feminist.  I’d need proof of this allegation as it isn’t logical.
C: (1.000%) T: "By starting with a question that so many get wrong but wind up learning the answer to, she’s also telegraphing that not knowing is part of the process of learning."  Goosebumps.   https://t.co/0PuYQ1YppQ
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is starting to move up in the polls.  She is winning and just itching to get to big business and Trump and all the cronies  and make them pay their share of taxes. A lady, who will make the working class healthy.
C: (0.993%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Newsflash moron, Bernie and Elizabeth Warren weren’t spouting racial hatred. The Dayton shooter did not use the language of either, because there is no racial hatred to parrot from them. Unlike the El Paso Shooter who used your EXACT WORDS.
C: (0.994%) T: @suzytweet @MadameButtons I am all in for Elizabeth Warren.  She is the anti Trump.  She is smart, works hard, and genuinely cares about others.  #Warren2020
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Well, the El Paso shooter used your exact words as his motivation. In contrast, the Dayton shooter did not use Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren words for motivation.  Therefore, El Paso was predicated on your racist fear mongering and Dayton was apolitical.  #RacistInChief
C: (1.000%) T: Donald J. Trump  @realDonaldTrump  “Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.”  @OANN   I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you! https://t.co/kxyRyuFU8k
C: (1.000%) T: @sandy_b_good @brianschatz I have to amend my reply.  Most Senators can speak forever, but I believe Elizabeth Warren was stopped by senator mitch because he ah ah didn't like her.
C: (0.985%) T: Dayton Shooter Attended Antifa Rally Armed With Gun Appearing 'Similar' To One Used In Massacre  "Betts' Twitter account showed he was a leftist Antifa supporter who praised Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders."  https://t.co/FfFduuOgxe
C: (1.000%) T: I'm not panicking about a few bad polls, but I remain steadfastly confused at how so many people want to lose to Donald Trump by running the only person he's already beaten.   Elizabeth Warren has many problems, but losing her lunch to Donald is the one I cannot get past.
C: (1.000%) T: Half of the Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who watched Sen. Elizabeth Warren debate in July said their opinions of her improved. https://t.co/xDOQkm8AAd via @HuffPostPol
C: (0.979%) T: @repjohnlewis If that's the case, John, then lay the Dayton shooting at Elizabeth Warren's feet. Then extend blame for the shooting of GOP Congressmen includong almost killing Steve Scalise to Bernie Sanders.
C: (1.000%) T: @interfluidity None of this will happen until we're done with Trump, at which points the adults in the room can re-think the trading system. Elizabeth Warren is already moving in this direction. What people have to understand is that the status quo ante didn't work for millions of people either
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren speaks with complete confidence and she'll tell ya why.i see many candidates but she is never on morning Joe, and her rise is no she doesn't try to be the most fashionable  she's like us, y had every candidates seem to appear many times her rising people like her
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC   MSNBC h my favorite channel morning Joe to brian Williams,  is dems candidates i hear good things about top tier canidates,but Elizabeth Warren rising seems to be downplayed she is playing a long game she explains all her positions smart,tought,capitailist whats up
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Why are you ignoring the LEFTIST shooter in Dayton? He was a Democrat. He loved Antifa. He was a big fan of Elizabeth Warren. Doesn’t fit your narrative. You can scream your lies all day long but they won’t make a difference. Trump 2020 in a landslide!!!
