C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren spoke plainly when she was asked if she believed Donald Trump is a white supremacist. https://t.co/odR2KkKH3n
C: (1.000%) T: @shaunking @kenklippenstein You're in the safe then, since no one believes you're black--probably including Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @SusanofTexas So if Elizabeth Warren becomes President, then everyone dies? Because I think she's a better candidate, then I don't care about "the lives of all future generations"?  Please, PLEASE tell me that I misinterpreted this.

C: (0.994%) T: @robreiner What about the Elizabeth Warren fan in Ohio?
C: (1.000%) T: kinda basic to understand  elizabeth warren has said herself she actively sought and would have accepted hillary clinton VP position  you can not claim to be a progressive after doing this  it kind of calls every progressive policy she steals and calls a plan into question
C: (0.708%) T: Just Listening and watching( and donâ€™t kill the Messenger) But Elizabeth Warren is smart and tough but not very Likable!!! I have been following Politics since 1968 and after following each Candidate this is my Conclusion..... Good Luck with your Choice !!!!!!

C: (1.000%) T: @EvanViktorsen In one day #DonaldTrump attacked:  Brian Williams  Tim Oâ€™Brien Joaquin Castro JuliÃ¡n Castro Beto Oâ€™Rourke Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Mayor Nan Whaley Sleepy Joe Biden Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Shepard Smith  Is this how a president unites a country mourning a mass shooting?
C: (1.000%) T: @JamesDo69729593 @VenusBitchTrap @msreinab @sequinjumpsuits So his job is promoting false racism claims on the president? I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. He's been blaming these attacks on Trump dude. Totally absurd! Might as well blame Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shootings with that logic.
C: (1.000%) T: Fox News: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a top Democrat in the 2020 presidential race, said President Trump is a white supremacist and has done â€œeverything in his power to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country. https://t.co/9lbMvLFy5M
C: (1.000%) T: Ultimately, the political and economic future of the US will be determined less by its trade policies than by its domestic policies of inclusion and structural transformation. @SenWarren has shown that she understands this, writes @rodrikdani https://t.co/cmADKqD8ti

C: (1.000%) T: This really put a huge dent in my support for Elizabeth Warren. Voting machines were shown at #DEFCON to be completely hackable. Even able to change votes. We need to be rid of the voting machine system. #votingreformnow https://t.co/p8D6PRXNf6 https://t.co/prroVz3cBv
C: (1.000%) T: @blanchedeverau5 Google Co-owner Sergey Brin - hosted a  Drug induced sex party in San Francisco ðŸ¥³ Elizabeth #Pocahontas  Warren is a very #NastyWomen. That party, was long before -- Google boot camp, another elite Top-Secret event. That 4 day party... is another story.ðŸ¥³ https://t.co/XPBPnTcyI0
C: (0.532%) T: @ewarren Plus this wasnâ€™t a deportation raid. Itâ€™s was a months long criminal investigation into identity theft and other crimes. But Elizabeth Warren will never tell you that. She canâ€™t afford for you to ever know the whole story.
C: (1.000%) T: @Wklawrence @JordanChariton @JoeBiden I would like nothing more than to see a policy-focused campaign; Iâ€™m pretty sure Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would prefer the same. But if the frontrunner is not of sound mind, we canâ€™t be too polite to point it out before itâ€™s too late.
C: (1.000%) T: @FaceTheNation @WCCO @SenGillibrand Why? I would prefer to see Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: I have said it from the outset. Warren, not Biden or some other "centrist," is by far the candidate best poised to beat Trump. Anyone who says otherwise is out of touch. Thankfully polls starting to foreshadow her as frontrunner. https://t.co/7Nm5gRY4lD
C: (0.990%) T: @FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump @BernieSanders What about the Democrat's Antifa member who shot up Dayton Ohio? You know, the one working for Elizabeth Warren?  The most deadly attack from Antifa in America so far.
C: (0.979%) T: @TheTattooedProf And yet conservatives bitch and moan about a photo of Elizabeth Warren sharing a pinky promise with a little girl at a campaign rally.
C: (0.993%) T: Elizabeth Warren knows her cowardice in 2016 contributed to the outcome, and doesn't want to talk about it. https://t.co/2DSddnJqZg
