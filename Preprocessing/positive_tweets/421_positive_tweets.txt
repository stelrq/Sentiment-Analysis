C: (1.000%) T: @KurtSchlichter So you‚Äôre approximately ten times as African as Elizabeth Warren is Native American????
C: (1.000%) T: @WajahatAli @grantstern How sweet would it be for Elizabeth Warren to defeat President Asterisk?  He should forever have an asterisk following his name when shown on any list of American presidents.  He got Russia‚Äôs help and he has NEVER behaved and spoken like an American president.
C: (1.000%) T: @FisherBurton @crypto_gaston I have to give credit to Elizabeth Warren's audience though they are in a transition zone where they are trying to make this work for the same reasons why I want everyone to vote for Amy
C: (0.726%) T: @sadiekristinee IS NO WHERE IN THE WRONG. she can support whomever she chooses, and elizabeth warren is, in my opinion, a great presidential candidate. everyone being rude to sadie, needs to take a step back &amp; realize what is wrong in our country. and how bad our government is.
C: (1.000%) T: Register Soapbox: Elizabeth Warren's full speech at the Iowa State Fair https://t.co/GHRvvV9lnl
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Look it's the tired &amp; overused "I'm relatable b/c you workin' class folk (clinging to your religion &amp; guns) like to drink beer like me!" bit reinvented by Karl Rove/George W. LOL at Democrats taking a page from the Neocon play book. Elizabeth Warren inspired the Ohio shooter.
C: (1.000%) T: 'It's so good. And it's moist!' Kamala Harris chows down on pork chops at Iowa State Fair while vegan Cory Booker opts for a 'Golden Fried PB&amp;J' and Elizabeth Warren takes a corn dog for the road https://t.co/eeBYLG9d2R
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. https://t.co/vYVHjnKWV4

The only that's even come close is Juli√°n Castro. I think Elizabeth Warren owes way more than an apology to Native Americans.
C: (0.971%) T: @Justus4evr @MomsDemand @Steph56Renee @ewarren Cause the NRA is kwown for attacking folks who are ambiguous about gun control. This is 2017 btw https://t.co/viES1JcQzK
C: (1.000%) T: @7777Beto7777 @Jflo918 Anything w ‚ÄúWarren‚Äù on it will hand the election directly to Donald Trump.   PLEASE people, we HAVE to be  realistic: Elizabeth Warren scares the damn socks off the Midwest voters with all her talk of ‚ÄúFREE‚Äù stuff.   To the voters we HAVE to win over, Warren is ‚Äúextreme left.‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: Democrat x Antifa = Mass Shooters  TX killer - environmental leftist arrived for an Antifa training event, harbored racial hatred for many years, even under Obama.   Ohio killer - liberal supporting Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Antifa &amp; socialism. https://t.co/0olLFRWG7k

C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren is a stronger, more articulate candidate and she's overtaking him (and this was her movement to begin with) - time to peel off, bros - don't let the Left get canceled out
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister With all due respect to Vice President Biden, a good man with a lifetime of service to our country, I agree with you.  Elizabeth Warren 2020.
C: (1.000%) T: @ProFootballTalk These polls are just as offensive as the name. I don't care what 500 self-identified Pretendians think. For us that live the life and are actual tribal members and not Elizabeth Warren 2.0....we know how we feel about a racial slur as a name.
C: (0.996%) T: @KaylaPeum You can claim to be native american like Elizabeth Warren (The OG pocahontas).
C: (0.994%) T: Vote for Elizabeth Warren please
C: (1.000%) T: @Ashley4Kxxx its what they do,prove them wrong with facts and they attempt insults. 5 seconds looking at her page shows shes a trend chaser,she thinks the way she is told to think. She talks about Trump &amp; the shooters yet is to stupid to know that the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Remember when that CNN reporter chased Elizabeth Warren through a train station and gave us the best media coverage we could have ever asked for? *chef‚Äôs kisses*
C: (0.617%) T: @tycooperaow @fdlepio @TheYoungTurks @realDonaldTrump Oh, bullcrap. And the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren Supporter.  That is like hating on cheeseburgers because the killer ate one. Stop being so stupid!
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery You feel that you know Trump. That‚Äôs on you. If you can‚Äôt recognize the authenticity, warmth, intelligence, empathy, and integrity of Elizabeth Warren and the other estimable Democratic candidates, that‚Äôs on you, too.
C: (1.000%) T: just thinking about that one post from the american debate thing that's like "elizabeth warren's makeup game is on point tonight"
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has the exact same birthday as the most talented and revolutionary actress of all time: Meryl Streep.   Donald Trump was born the day of a lunar eclipse, when an ice-cold rock blocked the thing which gives all humans life and energy.  Food for thought
C: (1.000%) T: The new plan is among @ewarren's broadest to date https://t.co/V7rTTdsj8Y
