C: (1.000%) T: @billmaher I fear that the Democrats will f****** again whoever the front-runner is I think you need to pound into their head that if Joe Biden becomes the candidate that he should probably get Elizabeth Warren as his running mate and not get some unknown nebbish like Hillary did
C: (1.000%) T: "People respond to the good feeling around her campaign as much as they respond to the blizzard of policy proposals that campaign has loosed upon the electorate." https://t.co/X6FJuRF6NX
C: (1.000%) T: "But the thing that's sold Elizabeth Warren to Iowa is primarily Elizabeth Warren. None of the candidates seems to be having as much fun as she is. The endless selfies after speeches. The pinky-swears with young girls about how what girls do is run for president.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: "historically Black colleges and universities... Close the Black white wealth gap"  She's just the best. At everything
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is my locked vote for president in 2020. Andrew Yang has really grown on me over the last few weeks. The V.P. run is becoming very interesting.  #TeamWarren  #ElizabethWarren2020  #whosvp2020
C: (0.592%) T: @MonaResists Also, just because somebody quotes somebody else, that doesnt mean it's their fault. The shooter at the baseball game 2 years ago, quoted Bernie Sanders and was doing it FOR Bernie. The shooter in Ohio quoted Elizabeth Warren and said they did it for her, so I guess
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 He's had a job helping Americans achieve economic justice, alongside Elizabeth Warren. With regards to the USSR/Russia, he's not currently being blackmailed by the USSR/Russia like Donald Trump and he has consistently spoken against AUTHORITARIAN communist governments.
