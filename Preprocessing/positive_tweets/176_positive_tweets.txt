C: (0.981%) T: @repjohnlewis You've been fanning the flames of that green bud too much.. The gunman was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren.. Did you blame Bernie Sanders when his supporter shot people at the congressional baseball game?
C: (1.000%) T: Actually, no, it does not. You tell me when Elizabeth Warren referred to Latinx as "invaders" or called Nazis "fine people," or referred to majority African American cities as "infested," and then you get back to me. The Dayton shooter hated women. You want to talk about that? https://t.co/wmtX7zk0jf
C: (1.000%) T: @Alan__Wright @IlhanMN @SpeakerPelosi Ilhan Omar (D) MN - Are you a Bernie 2020 supporter? She says Bernie Sanders' "ship might have sailed," as far as running in 2020 but could get behind warmongers Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, or Cory Booker, who are all about the Benjamins...
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's 'honest answer': Donald Trump is a white supremacist https://t.co/lSUSGtaQuT
C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro I’m glad they did. Simple rule of capitalism is that the lemonade is worth the price that the consumer is willing to pay. Elizabeth Warren accidentally artificially inflated the price of lemonade in Harlan thus hurting the people she vows to help.
C: (1.000%) T: BTW, this is also why the Finkelstein et al study of medical bankruptcy is superior to Elizabeth Warren's work on the subject. It's much more useful to know how much a medical event raises your probability of declaring bankruptcy than what % of bankrupts had some medical bills.
C: (0.539%) T: @CaroleW82896700 Elizabeth Warren and Beto O’Rourke have said they will #EndTheFilibuster. Cory Booker has said he’s “open” to ending the filibuster. Not willing to end filibuster candidates want the status quo and will not fight for US, #GreenNewDeal or #MedicareForAll.
C: (0.994%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren doubles down on calling Prez Trump a white supremacist, joining Beto O'Rourke https://t.co/eZSh5RqQjs
C: (1.000%) T: I am a journalist. I specifically follow Elizabeth Warren. I am in Iowa doing my job as a journalist following Elizabeth Warren and I was shocked when I "just happened" to see her buying lemonade. I mean, what are the chances!? https://t.co/wKIDJaceNn
C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren told The NYT  on Wednesday that she thinks President Trump is a white supremacist.  That is interesting since she spent years trying to make others believe she was an Indian.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren! “When life gives you lemons, make big structural change!” ❤️.                                                  https://t.co/MV2MJQkvuq.

C: (1.000%) T: @deepcow Okay. Does she say how black you have to be? 90%, 50%, 25%, 1% probably everyone except Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidWright_CNN @LevineJonathan My favorite word is Native-American as in  “Elizabeth Warren lied that she is Native American to get certain advantages in the academic world”
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren How did you just happen to come across the Elizabeth Warren when you cover her? You're a blatant liar just like her

C: (0.994%) T: @BetoORourke Did you call out Elizabeth Warren? The killer in Ohio loved her and antifa.
C: (0.993%) T: @TIME @kphbritt If Trump is responsible for this guy is Elizabeth Warren culpable for the actions of Her fan, #ConnorBetts ? #Dayton
C: (1.000%) T: Picture of Elizabeth Warren supporting lemonade stand capitalists brings with it some hilarious replies https://t.co/xSA0yFEy3Z via @twitchyteam 🍋 🍋 🍋 😉
C: (1.000%) T: Well that says a lot about Elizabeth Warren's economic sense. https://t.co/C61b8K37Ca
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren looks like the skeleton our elementary school nurse always dressed up for Valentine's and Halloween https://t.co/G4Z7kfi9rF
C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro Should say covering FOR Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: These are the candidates who have qualified for the September debate:  🗣️ Joe Biden 🗣️ Cory Booker 🗣️ Pete Buttigieg 🗣️ Kamala Harris 🗣️ Amy Klobuchar 🗣️ Beto O'Rourke 🗣️ Bernie Sanders 🗣️ Elizabeth Warren 🗣️ Andrew Yang https://t.co/Wm4QogJOxA
C: (0.934%) T: @Raccoonsister @trumplies34 @RepEscobar Did they deserve to be gunned down in Dayton by that socialist fuck who loves Bernie sanders and Elizabeth Warren? Don't hand me your shit, bitch.
C: (1.000%) T: You can't openly prove he is a racist. On top of that the Dayton shooter was a hard socialism supporter and loved Elizabeth Warren yet, we aren't blaming this on her. Just because guy was a Trump supporter doesn't Trump catered, caused, or supported him either. https://t.co/ZCPUS4c6Y6
