And she didn‚Äôt lie. She repeated something her family had told her. She stopped after investigating it. This was looked at carefully and she never got any job advantage out of it. This is a Trump troll talking point. https://t.co/Qn0WVkJKAq

C: (1.000%) T: @masercot @KBurback @SenWarren @Novartis @US_FDA A lot of people grew up being told they had Native American ancestry, Elizabeth Warren was one of them. As far as we know, it never helped her get anywhere she did. You know people have no policy-based criticisms of her when they resort to something like this.

C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera i remember when elizabeth warren said women were invading america and needed to be shot for like 5 years straight, and the dayton shooter specifically mentioned that in his nonexistent manifesto. you people really just go "oh this thing bad. therefore other bad thing the same!!"

C: (1.000%) T: @realMaxDinardo @idreamofanarchy @MikeGravel First of all you're wrong. Secondly it's hypocritical since u support Elizabeth Warren who was GOP until 1996, u know the RIGHT WING OF THE US and who said she wouldn't attend AIPAC this yr then LIED about it. U know Israel, the state that keeps Palestinians in open air prisons. https://t.co/8wmbq8nGoS

C: (1.000%) T: @ronb23_ron @charliekirk11 The fact that he was a huge supporter of Elizabeth Warren and Antifa speaks Volumes. Also  What kind of a Degenerate Raises Money off the Shootings = Elizabeth Warren that's who. What a disgusting person
C: (1.000%) T: @Dan37601714 @Road_trippn @realDonaldTrump @sundarpichai Exactly. His manifesto mentioned it specifically, it also quoted Trump's racist rhetoric, which is what encouraged him to commit such horrific acts. you're learning cause and effect, but still not quite there on deductive reasoning. So, find that Elizabeth Warren quote, please?
C: (1.000%) T: Word on street is the Mayor of Dayton, @nanwhaley (D), encouraged protests tomorrow when @realDonaldTrump arrives to wish condolences to the city.  What are they going to protest??  The fact the shooter hated Trump, loved Socialism, hated God, &amp; supported Elizabeth Warren??
C: (1.000%) T: @kimchinam58 @DanielNissen3 Yes, the Ohio shooter loved Elizabeth Warren and Antifa, and hated Fox news. So I know you all want to conflate those two things, but you can‚Äôt https://t.co/Zgs2C7KWxs
C: (1.000%) T: @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump And who do you want in there? Some bat-shit crazy narcissist like Elizabeth Warren who will steal 90% of all your money and spend it on a luxurious lifestyle for herself? Because Democrats do that. Remember the billions in taxpayer money that went to Baltimore and was squandered?
