C: (0.995%) T: #ElizabethWarren‚Äôs Classroom Strategy   A lifelong teacher, she‚Äôs the most professorial #presidential candidate ever. But does #America want to be taught?   https://t.co/DXDwElOXg6 https://t.co/DXDwElOXg6
C: (0.984%) T: @JoeNBC You're as stupid as your hairstyle. If you vote for Elizabeth Warren you are supporting mass shootings and racism...using a fake minority status to your advantage. FOH schmoe
C: (1.000%) T: I would love it if the world knew I maxed out my contributions to Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.   I mean, I haven‚Äôt given to either. But I would love for the world to know it if I did.
C: (1.000%) T: @RNCastaldo @maggiemel @Castro4Congress Here you go!!!!!!  My name is Mary M Thacker, 7570 Owls Hollow Rd, Gadaden, AL I donated $3 &amp; $10 to Elizabeth Warren and I donated $5 to Amy McGrath to help ditch Mitch
C: (0.627%) T: @Deena_Zaru Since the Dayton, Ohio shooter was a socialist who was going to vote for Elizabeth Warren, are the Dayton protestors requesting that Trump throw Warren in prison?   #DaytonShooting #Trump2020
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to change the bankruptcy code. Her plan would give everyday workers a better chance of getting severance when a company goes belly-up.  https://t.co/KAOHVCqjGY
C: (1.000%) T: @mcyost Also interesting how his idea of liking a candidate means sending a check. I like Elizabeth Warren, but Bernie‚Äôs the only one that‚Äôs seen my money
C: (0.989%) T: If fake news doesn‚Äôt report about the Dayton shooter being #ANTIFA‚ÄîWE WILL! The Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA https://t.co/SRnh3osFkW
C: (0.889%) T: There is a very simple difference. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don't make speeches which inflame racial hatred. They don't encourage an audience that shouts about shooting immigrants. They don't make racist attacks on members of Congress. Trump does all these things. https://t.co/xH14V3EJkN
C: (1.000%) T: Was Elizabeth Warren in communication  with the Daytona shooter?  Did she accept campaign donations from him?
C: (1.000%) T: "The standing of the two women speaks to their early organizing in the state, the on-the-ground experience of their staffs and one of Nevada‚Äôs unique political distinctions: the power of women" https://t.co/hXdEOzEycM via @politico
C: (0.998%) T: @JoeNBC I‚Äôve donated to Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and I‚Äôm fine with everyone knowing. üòéüëçüèΩ
C: (1.000%) T: President Trump: "The Dayton situation, he was a fan of Antifa. He was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Nothing to do with Trump, but nobody ever mentions that." https://t.co/Nmdds56lR6
C: (1.000%) T: @hrtablaze @realDonaldTrump @OANN But no one did. No one shot at him or threw a rock or squirted him with water, and no one bombed him. Wow those Elizabeth Warren supporters sure are scary.
C: (0.664%) T: @SenWarren I guess Elizabeth Warren's racism has inspired hatred and murders. When is she gonna denounce Antifa???
C: (0.987%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for a federal office to distribute $85 billion in federal grants for public broadband. @edscoop_news  https://t.co/uv6wWMIKgT
C: (1.000%) T: @Pappiness Our population is 325 million. There are 5000 KKK members that get very little support.  Now do Antifa.  The Dayton shooter followed Antifa and Elizabeth Warren.  How many Antifa members?  How much support to they get?  Antifa = KKK
C: (0.987%) T: @ABCPolitics He‚Äôs pulling an Elizabeth Warren.  It‚Äôs very obvious.
C: (1.000%) T: Can you imagine? Picking on High School kids? What an #adult, huh? @ewarren #nhpolitics #Pocahontas #LowLife #RealAdultsDontPickOnHighSchoolKids #fitn #dems https://t.co/Sh3w4VQt5J
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/Zc6OHxLc3X
C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders Since the Dayton killer supported boymth you and Elizabeth Warren, doesn't that make you responsible for his actions? When will you apologize to the victims, the victims' families, &amp; Americans for your inciting violence?
C: (0.986%) T: @ToriJordan212 @BreitbartNews Elizabeth Warren needs to quit while she's ahead.
C: (0.905%) T: @FunnyAndCoolGuy @KobotTheRobot Who‚Äôs far right? You‚Äôre getting defensive because I‚Äôm using your argument against you lmao. The Ohio killer was an ANTIFA coward and a fan of Elizabeth warren, therefor it‚Äôs her fault. Anyone else? Anyone?
C: (1.000%) T: @gtconway3d Yeah, and if you read the damned thing to the end he made it clear it wasn't about Trump. Waiting to hear you blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton... or do you only get behind the manifestos of white supremacists? I'll wait. #Hypocrite
C: (1.000%) T: Did you say the EXACT same thing 13 hours later about Elizabeth Warren who was the favorite of the Dayton shooter? No?  Didn‚Äôt think so.  Hypocrisy at its finest. https://t.co/o24CeksqbL
