C: (0.994%) T: @shivanihawkins @ewarren I really like Elizabeth Warren. The only problem is that the heroine in Game of Thrones ended up badly in the last program of the series.

C: (1.000%) T: @Mezikenyc @BernieSanders @ewarren Elizabeth Warren couldn‚Äôt write her way out of a box.
C: (1.000%) T: I know she‚Äôs got plans and stuff but the real reason why I like Elizabeth Warren the most is because she is the absolute cutest!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @snitfit1 Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/0NbiRrzx56 via @twitchyteam
C: (1.000%) T: @RobAnderson2018 Tough question.  Visceral punch is Elizabeth Warren.  Who I‚Äôll vote for in the Texas primary on Super Tuesday is Kamala Harris.   I contribute to both.   Booker and O‚ÄôRourke have their moments with me
C: (1.000%) T: Also her profile literally says ‚Äúcovering Elizabeth Warren‚Äù I don‚Äôt think you just happened to see this lol
C: (1.000%) T: @travisakers I mean what creature in the photograph with one of the biggest lesbians of time Elizabeth Warren I want somewhere delete me away from your Twitter account I don't associate with people like you.
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill Elizabeth Warren continues to fabricate facts about heritage &amp; President Trump for self polical gain! HER LIES SHOW SHE IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL!
C: (0.704%) T: @NateSilver538 It makes Bernie and Elizabeth Warren look vulnerable as well. I‚Äôm assuming some of the lower ranking younger dems are hoping to be chosen as VP and age attacks would probably hurt their chances.
C: (1.000%) T: Why did Rachel Dolezal get arrested and Elizabeth Warren gets to maybe become president?
C: (0.987%) T: @mgrant76308 Elizabeth Warren couldn‚Äôt beat her way out of a wet paper bag.
C: (0.989%) T: A throwback for you (circa 2012): @ewarren is who she says she is.   "I will work with anyone whose out there to fight for America's working families..."  https://t.co/priIrKk8n0

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from taxpayers at Harvard claiming she was a red supremacist. I said yes.

C: (0.976%) T: What Wall St actually thinks about Warren might surprise you. The markets hate uncertainty, and Warren‚Äôs detailed plans and past actions make her more predictable than trump.    The Economist | Pick your poison via @TheEconomist https://t.co/oLPu93YJFs
C: (1.000%) T: @todd_poirier @joshtpm @FLOTUS So did Democrats &amp; Elizabeth Warren create the dead in Dayton ?  Did Obama create all these dead given that he had the house &amp; the senate ? (But not the ball‚Äôs to do anything)  Your narrative falls flat pretty quickly when you play this game doesn‚Äôt it ?
