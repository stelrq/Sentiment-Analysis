C: (1.000%) T: Just the official campaign account for Elizabeth Warren repeating a long-debunked racial conspiracy theory, everything's fine, cool cool cool https://t.co/KsUoJvOWqm
C: (1.000%) T: @J_Innocente It comes from them perpetuating ‚Äòhands up don‚Äôt shoot‚Äô They banged that drum for months even though the police dispelled it right away. CNN commentators held up signs &amp; made the gesture. It cemented that In people‚Äôs minds. Elizabeth Warren just called him a murderer 5yrs on ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
C: (1.000%) T: @lbiredneck @WalkerBragman @painter_nancy Elizabeth Warren is the product of privilege and she is not qualified to represent the common people  After the radicals are smeared and the corporate establishment candidates are vetted the only one remaining is Amy Klobuchar  #anybluewilldo #bluewave   https://t.co/zKrWjpQJcV
C: (1.000%) T: Energy and Momentum are two perfect words to describe Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/Bkn7gdj9gP
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‚Äòmurdered by a white police officer‚Äô https://t.co/0ndoHrDGQy
C: (0.994%) T: Warren doubles down on calling Trump a white supremacist, joining O'Rourke https://t.co/LWCf1neAgO
C: (0.810%) T: @DaviMargolis It‚Äôs nothing close to Elizabeth Warren. She‚Äôs a socialist. Get a clue
C: (1.000%) T: @curtdoolittle ...Do you think the right will be the primary beneficiary of scaling back the First Amendment? I‚Äôd say more likely, the primary loser, especially the HBD aware right." (commenter Lot)  https://t.co/R49Ke3Gvsk
C: (1.000%) T: Gun control is wrong Homelessness  Bernie Sanders  Elizabeth Warren And just when you think these SOB can‚Äôt get worst add this to it Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a federal problem   Republicans solutions:  Thoughts and prayers  Red flag laws  Background check NOT needed https://t.co/82OZ2EFgL4
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden I saw Elizabeth Warren's post that pretty much said the same exact thing. Michael Brown charged the police officer and tried to get his gun. You and Warren are both idiots!
C: (1.000%) T: These people must honestly believe that they win points at the poll for pandering  üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ  Elizabeth Warren  https://t.co/cciigWZQft
C: (0.988%) T: @repjohnlewis WRONG!!!  BOTH SHOOTERS WERE NOT FOLLOWERS OF TRUMP, ONE SAID HE HATED THAT DEMOCRATS WANTED TO GIVE FREE HEALTHCARE TO ALL ILLEGALS, other one WAS AN ELIZABETH WARREN FOLLOWER. SO YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO ALL AMERICANS FOR YOUR FALSE STATEMENTS!!!
C: (0.995%) T: @NBCNews Understandable since the shooter in Dayton was an #antifa and Elizabeth Warren supporter. Basically a far left but case
C: (0.987%) T: @KamalaHarris Talk to your fellow Democrat, Elizabeth Warren. The shooter was her supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @brianstelter So you think one mentally ill POS means the entire country is racist? You are a special kind of stupid. With your logic, the Dayton shooter illustrates how Elizabeth Warren and the Democrats are the cause of mass shootings.
C: (1.000%) T: Anything Rebecca Traister writes is worth reading. This is fantastic. Especially inspirational to us teachers.  https://t.co/G74qtCaoQG
C: (1.000%) T: @KingDarius83 @AP Doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative, he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter tweeted positive notes about Antifa and was highly critical of his Republican senator on the issue of gun control. He must‚Äôve read the New Zealand shooters manifesto He also killed his sister
C: (1.000%) T: @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo By the way, is Chris or some one from CNN in Ohio? I believe I heard that mass shooter was a Democratic Elizabeth Warren supporter who hated Trump? If not, it's a shame once again CNN is politicizing a tragedy just to make DJT look bad. It's normal for the opposite party to do it
C: (0.892%) T: @morningmika She and all her democrats know both shootings were because of them. Not Trump or Trump supporters   El Paso was a racist SOCIALIST and environmental lune.  Dayton was a satanic Marxist communist who was in love with Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/VQwNcR4RUi
C: (1.000%) T: @scalesstev @dbongino I have yet to see a one of you be able to explain how a self professed white nationalist was radicalized to kill 9 people by Elizabeth Warren.   Not the cleverest of narratives you people have ever come up with.
C: (0.983%) T: @repjohnlewis What BS!  Keep trying to raise money off leftist Antifa, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporters!  Was @obama responsible for Sandy Hook? And the 5 Dead Dallas cops?? ‚ÄúPolice acted stupidly‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: @BenFran46118366 @tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump No. But he did cause an accident while drunk as shit and tried to flee the scene. He also is masquerading as a Hispanic when he's really Irish. So he is kind of like the male version of Elizabeth Warren but with more soy.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù @OANN  I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you! https://t.co/s62G0DXgfP
C: (1.000%) T: @kenneth_kerrick @SJWsAttackAll @car8i8 @TrumpWarRoom One of those shooters was a democrat. He was for Elizabeth Warren. You need to get facts before you tweet.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Thank you @QANN for all you do. We have to dig for truth these days. Highly recommend you and a few others! Here's another proof. Mass Shooting gunman supported Elizabeth Warren; Killer was Trump-hater who despised Cops  https://t.co/f9aORp1SSc
