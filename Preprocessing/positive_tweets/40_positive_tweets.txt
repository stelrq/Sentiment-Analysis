C: (1.000%) T: 1. They lied because their base STILL BELIEVES THE LIE. Telling the truth would hurt them. 2. Even worse for Harris... A former prosecutor. 3. So far every defense of this has been 'What about Trump?'... Which is literally whataboutism.   @DavidAFrench https://t.co/TXLK3ms5A3

C: (1.000%) T: I will never understand this level of vitriol and disinformation about Bernie--from someone who supports Elizabeth Warren. I get people preferring one of the left-ish candidates to him; I get good-faith policy criticisms, I even get people who think he's too old. But this? Wut? https://t.co/wDMmTsKL9b
C: (1.000%) T: @PhilipWegmann Imagine if Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren complained about their (legitimate) lack of coverage like this. The media would be  writing op eds about their likability.
C: (0.999%) T: THIS I think I might choose to refer to some of these Nationalists as "Oxycontin Morons", but they cannot twist the ideas of Sen. Warren to their benefit, because they don't have a PLAN!  Opinion | ‘National conservative’ policies are full of oxymorons https://t.co/Uvvdw5ZGCL
C: (1.000%) T: On Sunday, @ewarren’s op-ed was published in the @ElkoDaily. Elizabeth has a plan to expand access to health care and broadband internet to Nevadans in the rurals. It’s key that we support people in every community across the state. https://t.co/XTwsRpC1j0

C: (1.000%) T: @AhmedBaba_ @marklevinshow So your saying Elizabeth Warren's speech about Ferguson and Michael Brown was not just trying to appease a race to gain points??? I would really like to talk about this with you in a civil manner, chime back in if ya think you can be civil, and not be the normal emotional liberal

C: (0.995%) T: @mikewickett @WalkerBragman Why won't she vote for Mayor Pete or Kamala? How about Elizabeth Warren? Did she vote for Obama?
C: (1.000%) T: @TwitterComms This is exactly what Elizabeth Warren is talking about when she plans on government run broadband. Censoring content is a step they can easily remove when they can just shut down internet access whenever they want.
