C: (0.968%) T: @dbongino Well she could always follow Rachel Dolezel &amp; pretend she‚Äôs African-American or Elizabeth Warren and say she‚Äôs Native American. If you‚Äôre ashamed of how you were born and what God gave you then not much anyone can do. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ

C: (0.981%) T: @RoArquette This is the dopiest garbage I've read besides your other trash tweet. Tell me, who do you blame for Ohio? He retweeted Jared Holt, loved Elizabeth Warren, when do you call them out? They absolutely motivated this man by your metric.
C: (1.000%) T: The comments here about Bernie are not true. At all. Bernie talked in '15-'16,  &amp; does now, about aggressive antitrust-law enforcement  He believes that robust markets, when properly regulated, have a vital role to play. As they do in Scandinavia.  https://t.co/ZHMrC1tqqB
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol Bill - you are twisted.  We get it; you hate Trump.  A lot of conservatives hate his rhetoric; but come on;  You think that Elizabeth Warren is the way out?  Stick to policy not T's behavior

C: (1.000%) T: Reason 7872419 why Elizabeth Warren needs to be our next president: watch her humiliate the corrupt CEO of Wells Fargo so bad that he ended up resigning. This is what real leadership and passion for the issues looks like  https://t.co/hIVvYwS0Di
C: (0.992%) T: @MiguelArias_D3 @RubenNavarrette @POTUS @GarryBredefeld @GOP It doesn‚Äôt carry consequences for anyone.  If you accept only the part of a manifesto you want to justify your conclusion you lose credibility.  But if so, we must blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton.  Can‚Äôt have it both ways.  Or let‚Äôs blamevthe shooters period.
C: (0.995%) T: @naomi_serra if Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt win it was RIGGA MORRIS!!
C: (0.527%) T: @BetoORourke Are you calling out Elizabeth Warren for the Ohio killings?  No. Why it wasn‚Äôt either of their faults.  This was a person that had many problems that did a horrible thing!
C: (0.982%) T: @DanaLark3 @TuckerCarlson Uh huh... That's funny because most statistics show that the majority of individual violent attacks are committed against whites or it's black on black.

C: (1.000%) T: elizabeth warren doesnt have any black friends - Bernie sanders is overcome with lust for wallstreet blood so much so that I dont even think he can see anymore. Eric Yang is maybe the best person unless he secretly drinks blood. Kamala bout to say she had no other option,
