C: (0.988%) T: Elizabeth Warren joining the Banking Committee is maybe the highlight of my week.
C: (1.000%) T: @TomSteyer How about Ohio?  Supporting gun control, Elizabeth Warren, and socialism.  Squashed by @MSNBC.   How about Chicago or Baltimore?  Those constant stream of deaths don't count?  Oh yeah, they're Democrat run.  Nothing to see here.
C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are SATANISTS   Dayton shooter was reportedly a Satanist, Antifa Supporter and a fan of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders  https://t.co/9FFhzXK1g8
C: (0.985%) T: @NiceAmericaBear She‚Äôll suck your wallet dry, then she‚Äôll suck out your soul.   Elizabeth Warren is‚Ä¶ The Incubus
C: (0.866%) T: @RepEscobar @realDonaldTrump Crusius is a terrorist. LeCron is a terrorist. Connor Betts, the Dayton mass shooter who praised leftie Elizabeth Warren and antifa, is a terrorist. Their beliefs are twisted. It is political opportunism at its worst for Democrats to try to blame El Paso on the president.
C: (1.000%) T: @I_Harlequin @TracyNovick @rtraister According to this article, it wasn‚Äôt something she ever attempted to use while applying for school or jobs and they have the receipts. https://t.co/RcAbcb2Nb0
C: (1.000%) T: As of Tuesday afternoon, Yang is on top with 28 percent support, followed by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 22 percent. https://t.co/hWUiP08XUn
C: (1.000%) T: @delaneymeyer46 @StewardshipAmer @jimsx50 @morningmika if white privilege were real 1) rachel dolezal wouldnt exist, 2) "beto" would change his nickname to fritz, 3) elizabeth warren would have chosen finland or norway to fake her heritage for benefits  these truths lend credence to the fact whites are the opposite of "privileged"
C: (1.000%) T: @onehumanfamily1 @ewarren @ProudResister Sorry I'm not going to listen to the woman who lied about her Heritage to get ahead. And the whole seven children will die today staying kind of plays off people's emotions and fears. And the Dayton shooter was Elizabeth Warren fan.
C: (1.000%) T: @CNNPolitics Trust? Elizabeth Warren has made her refusal to hold high-dollar fundraisers a central talking point for her campaign. But according to an invite obtained by @AnnieLinskey, Warren is headlining a @DNC fundraiser where prices go up to $50,000 for VIP table. https://t.co/5hwNPrAIFH
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/vHRtTfd4mE
C: (1.000%) T: @Vote4Blue @ProudResister @ewarren I love Elizabeth Warren (we share same name!) but look at that @nytimes donor map.  I see  democrats giving me deja vu all over again üôÑ

C: (0.989%) T: ‚Äú...she‚Äôs also telegraphing that not knowing is part of the process of learning‚Äù https://t.co/pip9IH87XT
C: (0.969%) T: @ComfortablySmug @VCSteel1 Agreed. Elizabeth Warren supporter is ALWAYS a huge warning sign.
C: (0.994%) T: @ABC Yeah he should have condemned ANTIFA and Elizabeth Warren since the shooter was big fans of both.
C: (1.000%) T: @tariqnasheed https://t.co/ubIIrLZRcp  You seem to completely ignore the fact that the Daytona shooter was a member of ‚Äúthe resistance‚Äù, loved Elizabeth Warren, an  antifa member and hated Republicans.
C: (0.988%) T: @SteveBruks lol, one of the shooters this year was an Elizabeth Warren fan. is it her fault
C: (0.579%) T: @ndrew_lawrence Are you going to touch on how the Ohio shooter was an anti gun socialist and supported Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @buddarien @StopMSMLies @JoshOlsen14 @MagicalWriter13 @gapeach314 @realDonaldTrump ...which would pay for Universal Health Care, free public college, and subsidize all public programs like food stamps and fuel assistance (even for the illegal immigrants!), with money left over.) Tell me how this is bad for our country? This is Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs plan.
C: (0.973%) T: @rezaaslan Then that makes ALL radical, left wing dem's CULPABLE for the #DaytonOhioShooting that was caused by a supporter of Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders &amp; their socialist Hitler "brown shirt" Antifa thugs. So if u support Nazis then u are a NAZI. End.
C: (0.976%) T: @KellyannePolls @CNN @samstein Never bothered by facts, but you are ignoring the lack of causality. This murderer had a long term fascination with mass killing. He explored any violent ideology as part of that fascination. Name one thing Elizabeth Warren said or one policy that would make him kill as a result
C: (1.000%) T: also, i will be donating more to Bernie‚Äôs campaign along with Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs and probably Beto‚Äôs as well because i believe they are all good people with good intentions and would be thrilled for any of them to be president.
C: (0.825%) T: @realpace80 @ThanQ_TH @cristela9 @Castro4Congress ..as concerned about the victims in Dayton. Could think of a few reasons... Why aren't they doxxing Elizabeth Warren? Those on the left spew more hate daily than ANY Trump supporter! THEY are the ones dividing America, just like this doxxing attempt! Blind hypocrites!
C: (1.000%) T: I've said it before and I'll say it again:  If Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Julian Castro, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, and even Amy Klobuchar don't end up being president, each and every one of them needs to be in the next President's Cabinet.
