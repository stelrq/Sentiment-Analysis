C: (1.000%) T: @MuhammadLila @Hostage81625 I love all the people blindly blaming Trump despite the El Paso shooter vehemently detesting Trump, being a registered Democrat, and Elizabeth Warren supporter. Quit blaming one person for the twisted mind of another.
C: (1.000%) T: @sgtbetsysmith @AdamSerwer @ewarren Good morning ma’am, would you like to give an example of a quote from Elizabeth warren that you think inspired the shooter to murder his trans brother?
C: (1.000%) T: @cspanwj Elizabeth Warren is kinda funny to watch her swing her arms around..I keep waiting for her to pass a peace pipe around.

C: (1.000%) T: @tribelaw About like you should feel about the Antifa loving Elizabeth Warren supporting Dayton shooter you numbskull. You are a ghoulish asshole without an ounce of compassion or humanity to bring this vitriol into the lives of these grieving families. You sad fuck!
C: (1.000%) T: @JacksonLeeTX18 Wonder why #Democrats didn't bring up the same complaint about Elizabeth Warren who tried reviving the long-since debunked Michael Brown conspiracy. Even President Obama later stated the cop was justified. Liberal media trolled "Hands Up - Don't Shoot" to gin up racist sentiment.
C: (1.000%) T: @RealMattCouch @racephenom Just as important, can anyone imagine NK, Iran, or Russia dealing with Elizabeth Warren?

C: (0.933%) T: Oh Elizabeth Warren has a “plan” for that?  Does she have a plan to explain why she was a republican for most of her political career and is still a capitalist?
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden Wow, the only thing you had going for you, Joe, was your vague reluctance to call everyone a racist. Now you've joined the rest of the leftist clown car, and at that point, I should think the leftists would prefer a competent vehicle like Elizabeth Warren to a broken down wreck.
C: (1.000%) T: @SDKRMWEB @Gloomvi @ShomahKhoobi Maybe open a history book that wasn't edited by Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @ChiTownSam723 @KamalaHarris Elizabeth Warren is better than Kamala Harris in every way. Anyone who prefers Harris to Warren has issues.

C: (1.000%) T: "But the thing that's sold @ewarren to Iowa is primarily Elizabeth Warren. None of the candidates seems to be having as much fun as she is. The endless selfies after speeches. The pinky-swears w/ young girls about how what girls do is run for president."   https://t.co/FHb61wTAdC

C: (1.000%) T: @ProgressiveEsq @MomsThoughts @FlatticusF her campaign is smart. to distinguish warren from the pack, they released a slew of plans early, while some other campaigns were assembling their teams, to make it seem like she had ideas and others didn’t. it was a branding exercise and it worked https://t.co/9m5jF1mj1C
