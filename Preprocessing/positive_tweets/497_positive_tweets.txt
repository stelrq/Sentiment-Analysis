C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren will be worse for the Chinese than Trump so... I still won‚Äôt vote but if it comes to those 2 I‚Äôd win either way üôÇ
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @ewarren Elizabeth Warren's brilliant campaign continues to show momentum. In the latest Quinnipiac poll (released today 8/06/19) her approval has risen to 21% (vs Biden's slowly sinking 32%).  Bernie Sanders has slipped to 14%.  #PresidentElizabethWarren
C: (1.000%) T: @mommicality @Christa0003 @robbystarbuck @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl yo republican twitter, start a name and shame campaign donation doxx for all elizabeth warren donors... after all, the dayton shooter was a fan of hers she deserves it!
C: (1.000%) T: @holachola @rezaaslan @MattMurph24 OK friend,  well the el-Paso shooter was obsessed with race but he was basically for UBI/universal health care/ environmentalism.   The Ohio shooter loved Elizabeth Warren, and antifa and hated Fox News.   So by your thought process? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è https://t.co/cjvzrQFpIb
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump So how do you account for the Dayton shooter: lefty supporting Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @mrhollyofficial @Starbird_Tweets @AngryBlackLady You sound insane. It is a well established fact the Dayton shooter was a socialist that planned to vote for Elizabeth Warren.   Are you a big rap fan?
C: (1.000%) T: Our tax dollars paid for her face lift.   Kellyanne Conway is ‚Äòhopping mad‚Äô that Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt being blamed for the Dayton shooting - https://t.co/0UUJXXrQDR
C: (1.000%) T: @WeekInStupid @robreiner @cclement873 Meant to add that in the most recent example of mass shooting, it was the Ohio Board of Elections website that "tacked on the word 'Democrat'" to the shooter, identifying him as a registered Democrat. By the way, I understand he shares your admiration for Elizabeth Warren...
C: (0.984%) T: @rezaaslan Gotcha, so that makes Elizabeth Warren accountable for the last shooter‚Ä¶ He was one of her followers.
C: (1.000%) T: @Sinderlu @AlejandroRegent @noteabaggers @zz_dwayne @AlexanderAlic12 @rpdandy @realDonaldTrump By your logic Elizabeth Warren should not visit Dayton, and AOC should not visit the ICE Detention center that was firebombed.

C: (0.974%) T: @veldasue @angel717171 @KatrinaPierson @JoaquinCastrotx Absolutely none!!! Do your homework and stop listening to the lying fake news. BTW, did you know the Dayton Ohio shooter is a big Elizabeth Warren supporter. Maybe we should start blaming her for that shooting!!!
C: (0.995%) T: And Elizabeth Warren used to be a Reagan republican, pretty fucked up and disqualifying imo https://t.co/YR8wjtOIGC
C: (0.984%) T: @ewarren @SenWarren @SpeakerPelosi yeah why aren‚Äôt we hearing it here? Is this what the DNC wants Elizabeth Warren mass shooter encourager https://t.co/GYpEb0r5bY

C: (0.989%) T: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and 8 other Senators sent Sundar Pichai a letter urging him to reclassify Google's army of temp workers as full-time employees https://t.co/sCka0AUETd via @businessinsider
C: (1.000%) T: @RealRogerDodger @2beachgirls which guy killed those ppl over ideology exactly?? Are you going back to ohio again :) so liking elizabeth warren is an ideology what about if someone likes marco rubio and then commits a murder..is this rubiism?? Do u even hear the way your posts sound lol. Condemn White Sup now
C: (1.000%) T: @Sinderlu @AlexanderAlic12 @rpdandy @realDonaldTrump That's like blaming Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton Shooting or AOC for the fire bombing of the ICE detention center since they both used similar rhetoric used by the two politicians.
C: (1.000%) T: @larryelder Under Obama radical Muslims gunned down innocent civilians in Fort Hood Texas, San Bernardino ,California and Orlando Florida don‚Äôt remember the Media or Democrats like Elizabeth Warren blaming Obama for those mass shootings
