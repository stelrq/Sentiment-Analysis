C: (1.000%) T: @AP @BeenAwake Democrat. Antifa supporter and Elizabeth Warren fan. As the left holds Trump accountable for the El Paso shooting, we should hold DNC, Antifa and Elizabeth Warren accountable for this shooting. Or like logical people, we could hold the shooter accountable for their own actions.
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Charlie, you need to be reported for your lies. These lies cause harm to people. Is that what you want for Elizabeth Warren?

C: (1.000%) T: @Dan37601714 @Road_trippn @realDonaldTrump @sundarpichai Haha, okay, happy to show you how deductive reasoning works. First, I'll need you to find the most inflammatory Elizabeth Warren quote you can. Find one that encourages her followers to commit acts of violence. Once you have a good one, I'll take you through the next step.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr The shithole women Elizabeth Warren and the homosexual shithole black man doesn't understand America.
C: (0.993%) T: @Leelee85103021 @repjohnlewis @AOC @RashidaTlaib @SenSanders Sure. The fact that the Dayton shooter was a Elizabeth Warren fan probably had nothing to do with it. She spews so much hate rhetoric it's not even funny.

C: (1.000%) T: Any cop should be very nervous about an Elizabeth Warren presidency. If you get attacked and are forced to defend yourself, Warren will call you a MURDERER - even after a jury has completely acquitted you.    Warren will libel and slander you just to try to win favor with thugs. https://t.co/Wp7Gt5A9XZ

C: (1.000%) T: Twitter feed shows Dayton shooter was leftist and supported Elizabeth Warren - https://t.co/n6cEpFOGi6
C: (1.000%) T: @TODAYshow @ReporterBlayne Why do you not cover background on the Dayton shooter? Is it because people already did and they realized he was an @ewarren supporter? You all want to blame Trump for El Paso, then maybe you should blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton Ohio. A hundred bucks says this won't be seen.
