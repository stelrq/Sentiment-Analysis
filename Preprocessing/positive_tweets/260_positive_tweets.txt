C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx (C&amp;P) The leftist Democrat who committed a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio Saturday, killing at least nine people and injuring 27, expressed his support of leading Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Because, clown, Elizabeth Warren does not engage in the tyoe of rhetoric that would inspire one to go out and kill.....  Trump does.
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson bro...your supporting Elizabeth warren...who disparages actual native Americans with lies to get to the top...kinda sounds like yours support that kinda agenda.hmmm
C: (0.987%) T: Except in Dayton where it's Elizabeth Warren or D.C. where it's Bernie Sanders right?  Do realize how stupid you sound right now?  I wonder how much violence your own idiotic rants are inciting for someone too disturbed to know right from wrong let alone truth from lies. https://t.co/wesRwpknqS
C: (1.000%) T: Read the El Paso shooter’s unsigned manifesto for yourself! Don’t just believe the words of the lying media &amp; the even more dishonest Democrats!

C: (1.000%) T: @redhotnerd @ewarren Actually the story is according to Bloomberg not Elizabeth Warren. Of course Bloomberg does show minimal partisan bias, unlike Fox News which is completely for conservice. My suggestion is to do some research on Associated Press which shows to be fair to both sides.
