C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner How about the one in Dayton, Meathead, in the name of Elizabeth Warren. Shall we discuss that one? That guy was pro Antifa and a supporter of Elizabeth Warren. El Paso was about climate change and was clear his view pre-dated Trump. Be honest and stifle it!

C: (1.000%) T: @BJR3_Boston @DNCWarRoom @realDonaldTrump Letâ€™s burst the Democratic bubble! Ya know what else was a lie? The shooter was not motivated by Trump like dems wanna claim.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren pushed the Russian (amplified by Bernie Sanders) propaganda bullshit that the DNC rigged the primary for Hillary and attacked Obama over paid speeches.  I love her policies. I think sheâ€™s a good person. Iâ€™m not sure her political instincts are right for the WH.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren is not perfect but your statement is completely untrue. How far some people will go to earn a dollar - you should be embarrassed.
