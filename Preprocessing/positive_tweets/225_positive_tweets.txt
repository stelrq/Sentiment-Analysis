C: (1.000%) T: @FireballLush @scrowder The section about native Americans is interesting. Elizabeth Warren didn't conclusively benefit from her claiming to be native. https://t.co/lgHuPtqF6Z But outside that, someone has to look native to be native? Is that because you conceive a race with superficial characteristics?
C: (0.991%) T: @AP He was a Democrat who would have thought that a SOCIALIST killer wow and Elizabeth Warren voter so I guess that means she killed these PEOPLE that's what they said about PRESIDENT TRUMP so the shoe fits where it. A SOCIALIST killer a Elizabeth Warren voter
C: (1.000%) T: @samstein He was a card carrying Satanist who loved Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: I love to keep tabs on the IQ of the folks in Twitter!! Right now it seems to be about the same number that was used to measure the amount of native blood held by Elizabeth Warren!
C: (0.988%) T: @NBCNews And was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.... You forgot that one FakeNews
C: (0.593%) T: @CNN @CNNOpinion Agreed. Otherwise, we'll have to blame Elizabeth Warren for inciting the Dayton shooting.
C: (0.997%) T: @bigmomabama @CNN Well, he would have voted for Elizabeth Warren, so I would def say he had some sort of mental illness.
C: (1.000%) T: Listen up, Peoples! ELIZABETH WARREN + BERNIE SANDERS + PRO-ABORTION = DAYTON SHOOTER. He supported, favoured, liked their views on issues. He didn’t like Trump or Republican. Just like The NYT was forced to change its Headline allegedly, MSM did it freely. And you believe them.
C: (0.982%) T: Same idiots were kicked out of the Elizabeth Warren appearance in Phoenix last week. https://t.co/1TAMWINa2A
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth warren is the embodiment of the “I’d like to speak to the manager” stereotype
C: (0.993%) T: @johnlegend People who look for racism everywhere, are probably RACISTS! Congratulations! Hmm, the Dayton, Ohio terrorist, was going to vote for Elizabeth Warren! She is part of the problem!
C: (1.000%) T: @Virtual_Prof @rezaaslan By that logic, Bernie Sanders is responsible for the actions of the shooter that shot at Republican Congressmen. Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the actions of the Dayton shooter. President Obama was responsible for the 30-plus mass shootings during his presidency.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepJoeKennedy Because the Ohio murderer was a leftist nut, fully supporting Elizabeth Warren. That is the only reason left the news as fast as it came.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren plays 9 to 5 and walks around handing out packets labeled “PLANS” in liberty green https://t.co/XUg5wJEdef
C: (0.994%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Maybe the Dayton Elizabeth Warren supporter listen to her Democrats in Congress that called for street violence. You know the two I’m referring.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr I can't even fathom what will happen with the lunatic thay is in command...i fear for our future. I put my small dollars (currently from unemployment $) into Elizabeth Warren - please save America from what Trump (the destroyer in chief) has destroyed. My son deserves a future.
C: (1.000%) T: The other shooter this week was a hardcore leftist commie who supported Elizabeth Warren. So how many of you guys denounced him this week? https://t.co/i8s3W0MCuQ
C: (1.000%) T: @trenttrail You do realize the kid with the manifesto was a Democrat and socialist, right? He said he planned to vote for Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @secularcitizen2 Maybe you don’t care because it’s Reps this time, but would it bother you if Bannon posted your name &amp; employer on Twitter with the inference that you should be fired or physically attacked for your political views? Like Elizabeth Warren &amp; Dayton Shooter? https://t.co/V3E6MVnDhp
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC Dayton shooter was staunch Democrat Socialist who supported Antifa &amp; Elizabeth Warren          IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH WATCH WHAT U SAY--AMERICA IS WATCHING ALL OF YOU------ALL-------
C: (0.989%) T: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and 8 other Senators sent Sundar Pichai a letter urging him to reclassify Google's army of temp workers as full-time employees..#Google..https://t.co/yk2dXcTSBd
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The one guy was a leftist Elizabeth Warren supporter, the other an extreme environmentalist. Stop using Trump as your patsy- he has nothing to do with their views. People are responsible for their own actions.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I ask if Elizabeth Warren had a chance to win the presidency. I saud her chance of winning was -150%
C: (1.000%) T: @julianxpineda Marianne Anderson , Andrew yang , Elizabeth warren and joe Biden
C: (1.000%) T: @thepattymatos @AlyssaMastro44 I’m the open door— inviting anyone to climb onboard, but custom made to welcome President Elizabeth Warren.
