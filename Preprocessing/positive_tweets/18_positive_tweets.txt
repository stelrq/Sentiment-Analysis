C: (1.000%) T: Celebrated by dropping a little locally sourced grassroots money on Elizabeth Warren, as is tradition
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisWarmuth @MiltonRubenfeld @truthwarrior70 @nowwerevolt @foxandfriends Maybe you're thinking of Elizabeth Warren? She has proposed a wealth tax on households with over $50M in assets, roughly 0.2% of households in the US https://t.co/5oKx3zfhsh
C: (0.999%) T: @marklevinshow I've met Elizabeth Warren. She's am incredibly nice, completely authentic person. I do not think "hate" means what you think it means.
C: (0.774%) T: Former Missouri Dem lawmaker, retired officer blasts Warren for tweet claiming Michael Brown was murdered  https://t.co/cZpyncgTHd Lil chicken head pocohantas scrapes the depths of despair to claw and scratch her way to notoriety. Disgusting
C: (1.000%) T: @SenSchumer Chuck, I am a Democrat but you sound older than Joe Biden. Elizabeth Warren is 70, yet she sounds like a 21st Century leader. Pass the baton, it‚Äôs time.

C: (1.000%) T: @SpeakerPelosi A few days ago, America watched in horror as a Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA Supporter committed violence in Dayton Ohio, taking the life of nine people including his own sister. We remain committed to ending Leftist Hate in all its forms.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is a joke. She is a cheat and scammer. Just who needs to stay out of Politics. #Pocahontas #FactsMatter #CloserNation #CloserMoments #FailedDemocratCoup https://t.co/6yoVOV07oJ https://t.co/YFNncZ2avC
C: (1.000%) T: @SebGorka Elizabeth Warren supporter. How come this is getting no coverage in the MSM?
C: (0.999%) T: A distortion of the truth started a movement that IMO made things worse in America. https://t.co/6PRXrM1mV8
C: (0.996%) T: @wholesickcru @DavidAFrench Anyhow, the very fact of us having this argument is proof that it‚Äôs an argument worth having with strongly held beliefs and evidence on both sides. Nobody is doing this just for politics. It‚Äôs an important conversation. So maybe stop calling Elizabeth Warren a liar.
C: (1.000%) T: @kimguilfoyle You'd be all for it if Matt Gaetz posted the names and employers of donors to Elizabeth Warren. Delighted, in fact. Save your "principled outrage"‚Äîwe know it's not either one.
C: (1.000%) T: Do you like dogs? And having a beer? And Elizabeth Warren?   Combine all 3 at the "Barks &amp; Brews for Warren" event on Aug 17 at @eastnashbeer! üêïüçª  https://t.co/k89wR4nLpp

C: (1.000%) T: @mindiva68 @Tonti200 @harleyride @BetteMidler Mindy, take a look at the two mass shootings this weekend. Both shooters were left wing Democrats. One supported Elizabeth Warren. The other -- an environmentalist wacko who was a Democrat and wanted universal income. What did the media do? Blamed Trump! How is that not delusion?

C: (0.953%) T: @MSignorile @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl 2/2 AND "inspiring violence and mass murder"? Dayton shooter was a Leftist and a proud supporter of Antifa and Elizabeth Warren. Mass murder? Democrats advocate for death to the unborn.  How about 60 million killed in USA by abortion since 1973? that's MASS murder.
C: (1.000%) T: very little, scant coverage of the fact that this Dayton shooter has been confirmed as having a Twitter feed that was supportive of Antifa, that was supportive of Elizabeth Warren, [Democratic candidate] Bernie Sanders."  CNN MSNBC where is the coverage
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Elizabeth Warren didn't feed into his mental illness. Can't say the same about 45 and his feeding his racist, white supremacist base.

C: (1.000%) T: I have a #dream again...  So I WILL NOT RUN from America @wealthgapnet   My dream today (1st in years - laughing to myself about it being #political) is for a Marianne Williamson @marwilliamson (#President) &amp; Elizabeth Warren @ewarren (#VP) ticket in the 2020 American #election
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisRBarron @_SOURKIDZ_ It‚Äôs almost like he wants someone to post The list of Elizabeth Warren donors...
C: (1.000%) T: @wookietim @IvankaTrump Connor Betts, Ohio mass shooter, was a ‚Äúleftist,‚Äù wrote that he would happily vote for Elizabeth Warren, praised Satan, upset about the 2016 election results, ‚ÄúI want socialism, and i‚Äôll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding.‚Äù
