C: (0.996%) T: Elizabeth Warren says "The next President has a moral obligation to use whatever executive authority she has to address the gun crisis,"   I love how she said ‚Äúshe‚Äù. üíô  #OneVoice1  #GunControlNow  https://t.co/UiSsD3wC1y
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to tax ammo at 50%.  How does this do anything other than make it harder for poorer people to buy ammo for self protection where the majority of the crime takes place?  #2A #ConcealCarry
C: (0.983%) T: @scullyseviltwin @JB101_ @ewarren Elizabeth Warren quite literally has a plan for that

C: (0.999%) T: @bunkystark @WildBillWellman @VaughnHillyard Poison is poison. Neoliberalism whether it‚Äôs from the right or left is poison. Which is why Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren IMO are the best candidates running right now.
C: (1.000%) T: That doesn't sound much like a champion of the people, what Surrogate Swett is saying, and I doubt that many of my fellow veterans will be impressed by the claim that Biden "loves the country more than anyone else".    I support Elizabeth Warren, an economic freedom fighter. https://t.co/iL6oTlu0dO
C: (1.000%) T: @Dax_x98 I was a Berner in 2016. I really don't want to put in another 70+ white man tho.  I get that its ageism but people don't live forever.  If we have to have an old white person, let's at least put Elizabeth Warren in.
C: (1.000%) T: via @instapundit: HEH: I‚Äôm embedding this tweet mainly because I‚Äôm fascinated by this picture of Elizabeth Warren. ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/UPnY3PPPzv
C: (1.000%) T: Fun alternative responses I can actually support with fact  BARACK OBAMA AND ERIC HOLDER CONFIRM ELIZABETH WARREN IS A RACE BAITING LIAR PERPETUATING A HOAX THAT'S RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF OVER A DOZEN COPS.  Their investigation refutes 100% of her BS... my statement = 100% true. https://t.co/V7jWZijKqv

C: (1.000%) T: @KatiePavlich Elizabeth Warren is trying to eventually drive gun and ammunition companies out of business. Won't work
C: (1.000%) T: When you‚Äôre on your post-work jog listening to an Elizabeth Warren interview, it‚Äôs possible to SEE THE REAL ELIZABETH WARREN on her post-work walk, then stop and shake her hand, tell her you‚Äôre listening to her, then not have the courage to take a selfie. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #Warren2020 @ewarren
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Issues Gun Control Ultimatum, Promises Swift &amp; Immediate Executive Action If Elected President  The mainstream media isn‚Äôt reporting that the Dayton shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.997%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Have you commented on the Dayton shooter being a Elizabeth Warren supporter? Or doesn‚Äôt that fit your agenda?
C: (0.987%) T: @KimHenke1 @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Hmmm, both were registered Democrats and one was an Elizabeth Warren and aoc supporter who hated trump, but we wont talk about that one right. The el Paso one wanted to do population control due to the urgency over climate control..hmm, who pushes climate control.. ooh yeah, aoc
C: (0.606%) T: @Croatsky @hasanthehun The Dayton shooter's twitter profile literally said he was a leftist and Elizabeth Warren supporter. Now I'm by no means saying that the left or EW caused it (again, they didn't cause it), but to say there aren't radical leftists is inaccurate.
C: (1.000%) T: @Kintu3 @BreitbartNews Elizabeth Warren lied about being a Native American for political and financial gain. And what's going on with her neck? It looks like a giant anus.
C: (1.000%) T: @emrazz @BetoORourke How could the shooter not like women yet be an Elizabeth Warren supporter?
C: (0.988%) T: @RealSaavedra It looks as if Elizabeth Warren is completely repulsed by this woman.
C: (1.000%) T: @KellyannePolls the Elizabeth Warren Shooter in Dayton, OH was inspired by the hateful, extreme language of socialist leaders like @AOC and @ewarren .
