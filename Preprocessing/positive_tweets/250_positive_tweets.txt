C: (0.518%) T: @LochnerWalter @starznmeeyez70 The Ohio shooter was a far left, ANTIFA, Elizabeth Warren supporter. So that was her fault according to you.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN He also had a history of being able to easily buy a military style weapon. Also, no evidence his motive was political. El Paso shooter was. Directly inspired by Trump. Elizabeth Warren never inspired anybody at her rallies to hate anybody.
C: (1.000%) T: am so, so moved by @rtraister on @ewarren and teaching. not about Warren as a person, so much, although that's in there. just - enacting change through thoughtful pedagogy, seeing the individual student and the whole system at the same time.  https://t.co/GE1C6qjVrE
C: (1.000%) T: This is really, really important.  https://t.co/PqRAplfWX3

C: (0.966%) T: @Mikel_Jollett @rezaaslan Actually, the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, registered Democrat and supported Socialism.  So is she to blame?  No, the guy was just a nut.  The blame is on the shooter, nobody else. https://t.co/KPsT9stOh5

C: (0.986%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt see you mentioning the Dayton Ohio shooter was a socialist, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and ANTIFA supporter!
C: (1.000%) T: @zatchry @SenSherrodBrown Killer was a liberal supporter of Elizabeth Warren, Zach silent.
C: (1.000%) T: Why aren‚Äôt Dem presidential candidates and mainstream media attacking Elizabeth Warren, #Bernie, #AOC &amp; her pack for the #DaytonOhioShooting? Doesn‚Äôt fit their narrative. Conservatives don‚Äôt because we place responsibility squarely where it belongs- on the shooter. #MassShootings
C: (1.000%) T: When folks in rural communities speak, Elizabeth Warren listens. These policies are directly informed by conversations &amp; research that took place right here in Iowa. I can tell b/c I knock door in these communities every week. Big, structural change begins at the grassroots level https://t.co/LJwR6pqWlB
C: (1.000%) T: @larhing @realDonaldTrump @OANN @FoxNews Oh you forgot to mention Ohio killer who was a liberal and supported Elizabeth Warren, I hope any news outlet will report that but they won't, all hypocrites... #Trump2020Landslide  Oh and there were 24+ mass shootings under Obama, did you speak out back then?
C: (1.000%) T: White supremacist Elizabeth warren and Antifa are responsible for the White supremacist murderers.. murdering POC

C: (0.997%) T: @dtcav @AngryBlackLady @GOP OOOOOR.. you can say that the Dayton shooter was a Democrat and fan of Elizabeth Warren.. and the El Paso shooter had written the Democrats rhetoric triggered him.   Or you can marginalize Republicans.. I have a feeling what you might do
C: (1.000%) T: @yashar @varadmehta Elizabeth Warren, who got a special position at Harvard Law school because she was of Native American ancestry took a DNA test that said she probably has absolutely no Native American ancestry.   That's worth at least a dozen gaffes. She's still in.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if we are really supposed to believe anything Elizabeth Warren says.   I said no.
C: (1.000%) T: *large majority of shooters consist of white supremacy fueled vitriol, and explain their motives being to establish a white ethno-state*  Republicans: I sleep  *one shooter out of the 290 this year happened to follow Elizabeth Warren on twitter*  Republicans: THE LEFT IS VIOLENT!
C: (0.693%) T: @Puzzle80X @bootlegpepsi @billmaher He supported antifa and Elizabeth warren. Media has of course downplayed it. You have been lied to by omission and are too incurious to know any better. I dont blame you
