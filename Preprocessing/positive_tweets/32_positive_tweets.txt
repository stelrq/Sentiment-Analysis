C: (1.000%) T: @hansalexrazo @largeroundson Bernie Sanders: Rich Elizabeth Warren: 1 class for $400K Kamala Harris: refuses to exonerate death row inmate with exculpatory evidence. Biden: Rich Biden Son: Rich Biden Brother : Rich Biden Family: deals with China, got rich with political corruption.   You were saying?

C: (1.000%) T: @LizMair There's already more Federal $ than crooks can steal, aimed at providing broadband to rural areas.  People here have been suckling at the public teat for over 2 years without accomplishing anything.  Elizabeth Warren is out of touch.  Focus on getting something for our money.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren SHE CAN DO IT. FUNDING? Very possible. Taxing the ultra rich for their fair share , a very , very miniscule part of their enormous wealth will make it POSSIBLE. Sen Elizabeth Warren will give the marginalized a reason to GO OUT AND VOTE 2020!!!
C: (1.000%) T: I generally like Elizabeth Warren but this is a terrifying thought. Public broadband monitored and distributed by the government would absolutely be prone to privacy abuse at best and downright Orwellian at worst https://t.co/QJv6ZdJwhQ

C: (1.000%) T: @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Hey Ted Lieu remember when people actually cared what you thought? Me neither... Aren't you challenging Elizabeth Warren? Her name was mentioned to.
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Would you also be requesting the tax returns for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Maxine Waters, Ilhan Omar, AOC, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris? You get the point...
C: (0.986%) T: @cnnbrk Was his friend Elizabeth Warren,.. or was that just who he looked up to?...
C: (0.975%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress Nope. The bastard who murdered folks in Walmart needs to be treated as the animal he is. Never forget.  How about the scumbag in Dayton? A leftie backing Elizabeth Warren and wanted gun control. Wow. That fucks up your narrative, doesn't it? Trump had nothing to do with this.

C: (1.000%) T: @radleybalko Would it be ok to publish names of people who donated to Bernie Sanders?  Elizabeth Warren?  Barack Obama?  Is the argument here that principles don't matter and whatever is politically convenient is best?
C: (0.604%) T: @ClemSkelton @TimMurtaugh @kayleighmcenany It is if they are registered Democrats. Oh wait Dayton shooter was a Democrat taking orders from Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.983%) T: @voweler @Castro4Congress @Twitter @facebook No, about the last shooter: the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren (and Bernie Sanders) supporter who advocated for socialism, communism and supported Antifa. https://t.co/uGsfo7Vlpb
C: (1.000%) T: There goes Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax paying for everything under the sun. https://t.co/geMe3sqmg6
C: (1.000%) T: @ananavarro @ewarren Come on, Anna. I have had the highest regard of you for a very long time. This asseveration is gratuitous and unfounded. It's important that you retract yourself. Elizabeth Warren is first of all an American, and also lady, a democrat and a Democrat (in that order).
C: (0.983%) T: @BernieSanders if @realDonaldTrump is responsible for the El Paso shooting, than you are responsible for the @SteveScalise , @ewarren is responsible for the shooting at Dayton, OH, ... https://t.co/Uqicc0N6rA #FoxNews
C: (0.990%) T: @DaMac80 @JoeNBC Or maybe what happens when a Warren &amp; Antifa supporter kills 9 &amp; injures 27 in Ohio? Does Scarborough think all Elizabeth Warren supporters should be lumped in with this psychopath in Dayton? Are all Bernie supporters the same as the psychopath that shot Steve Scalise to @JoeNBC?
C: (0.995%) T: @GeorgeRumbo @realDonaldTrump Do you blame Elizabeth Warren, antifa  for the Ohio shooting, that POS supported them.  Iâ€™m guessing you must blame them right?
C: (0.995%) T: You know Elizabeth Warren hates this. https://t.co/aSW4WkQHWA
C: (1.000%) T: Am I the only one who is absolutely sickened by the fact that Elizabeth Warren used the tragic killings in El Paso and Dayton to fundraise for her campaign??
