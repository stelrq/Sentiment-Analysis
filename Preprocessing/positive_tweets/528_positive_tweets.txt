C: (1.000%) T: @azcentral @LaurieRoberts And the Dayton shooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren.  Why not blame her for that shooting?  The truth is that over the past 50 years we’ve stopped being a society that teaches self governance and right and wrong are now replaced with relative morality.
C: (0.987%) T: @jimsciutto Know that the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren and Antifa! #DaytonShooter
C: (1.000%) T: @EdIsBackKAG2020 @DclareDiane Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter ergo she is responsible according to MSM logic.
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Apparently the #shooter in #Dayton, Ohio loved #Elizabeth #Warren........  @robreiner what does that tell us? .........   #Democrats inciting terror? .... #explanation  needed!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @AP As I said this morning we need to clean our White House up. This is disgusting and the election convictions must be made before primary 2020. Gold standard and money back with formal adjudication of Congress for cocaine trafficking with Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/17SCEwQZha
C: (1.000%) T: @atrupar Well, yes. The Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren and Antifa! #DaytonShooter
C: (1.000%) T: @nytopinion I thought it was the gun that is to blame not the shooters worldview of white nationalism? For if it is the latter to blame then what do you say about the Dayton shooter who supported Elizabeth Warren, was an avowed Satanist a registered Democrat and a gun control advocate?
C: (0.994%) T: Reminder to the Warren stans that Elizabeth Warren SUPPORTS the economic sanctions (now basically an embargo) on Venezuela—which have killed an estimated 40,000 Venezuelans.  The US sanctions on Venezuela are an act of war and a crime. https://t.co/WHpZeW0eDs
C: (0.948%) T: @TalbertSwan @johnpavlovitz @realDonaldTrump @OANN And the Dayton shooter talked about how much he loved Elizabeth Warren. Does that mean it’s Elizabeth’s fault for the shooting? Didn’t think so bud.

C: (1.000%) T: @milanobsession @realDonAgnelli And it’s funny how you seemingly have no issue with the Dayton, OH shooter? Why is that? Because he was a big socialist and Elizabeth Warren fan? By your logic, should we be blaming Warren for what he did???
C: (1.000%) T: @BreitbartNews You obviously have no idea what the word: “Racist,” means. BTW:The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan and the El Paso shooter was not a fan of Trump and said he wanted to kill long before Trump was President. What say you about that?
C: (1.000%) T: @CharlesMBlow Then what do you call the act committed by the proSatan Elizabeth Warren voting leftist who shot up Dayton?
C: (0.985%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN You don’t hear Bernie or Elizabeth Warren encouraging their supporters to create violence.
C: (0.987%) T: @SenSherrodBrown But the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren and Antifa. #DaytonShooter
C: (0.785%) T: @BrentMcCay I would not be angry and the Elizabeth Warren donors would not be ashamed and embarrassed by it.  It's public knowledge for a reason.  A really good reason.  It shouldn't bother you.
C: (1.000%) T: @lispod1966 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @GOP The Dayton shooter followed Elizabeth Warren. And was a member of Antifa  Factual info is necessary to make a statement.
C: (1.000%) T: @WarrenSapp He was a supporter of Antifa according to his Twitter account. He also tweeted support for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  This was all reported by CNN.
C: (1.000%) T: @BrentMcCay Elizabeth Warren donor here. Public record political contributions being posted are not a problem. It is very clear, when donating, what could be public in regard to donations.
