C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Good you you Elizabeth Warren. Outlaw all military style assault weapons of any kind. Then give the owners up to six months to participate in a buyback program. After that date, make it a federal crime to possess any military assault weapon of any type.

C: (1.000%) T: The risk of brain tumor in a patient with headache and a normal neuro exam is about 1/1300; less than Elizabeth Warren's chance of being a Native American.
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister I agree. I thought he was a shoe in but it's looking less so. I'm beginning to think more and more about Elizabeth Warren. She's strong. It's early and I haven't made up my mind for sure yet.

C: (1.000%) T: @Francine00100 @Laser2Therapy @livelygames @streetnoodle @JohnCornyn @FLOTUS Elizabeth Warren does not call other people 'infestations' or use the rhetoric of the Nazis, or laugh about "shoot them" at rallies. Antifa belongs with the Proud Boys. They have the same amount of influence... They are not a Senator or POTUS.

C: (1.000%) T: @hrtablaze I think Kamala has running for a political office confused with being on a reality TV show. Someone needs to tell her they are not the same thing, there is a difference. Elizabeth Warren is also confused.üìÉüé¨üìΩ

C: (1.000%) T: BTW, Elizabeth Warren, @ewarren, seems you do not know the why the Orientals eat with Chopsticks, I even wonder how they feed their babies, maybe, with Toothpicks, and sit on the floor, as well as sleep!
