C: (0.988%) T: @TaxReformExpert @bobwadejr31 The only abortion I would support would be retroactive for Elizabeth Warren and the Deep State.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Typical democrat distorting the facts to push their narrative! Elizabeth Warren is a lier &amp; a race-baiter! Set aside Mr Brown robbed a liquor store minutes earlier!  Focus on the fact that he physically assaulted an officer and tried to take his firearm! Justifiable self-defence!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is a white supremacist. I said yes. #Pocahontas
C: (0.987%) T: REPORT: Networks silent on shocking leftist leanings of Dayton shooter, support for Antifa, Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/9bDOtwYdBN
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says screw your ISP. Let‚Äôs make the internet a public utility https://t.co/E5uPLCGrIE https://t.co/iBUw4KoS5F
C: (0.699%) T: @benshapiro Over 600,000 abortion in America in 2015. 68,000 ODs in 2018 and you're worried about one AR-15 rifle. If the AR-15 is ban then they will come for the rest of your guns. Don't forget the Dayton Ohio Shooter was an Elizabeth Warren follower.
C: (1.000%) T: @john_roggeveen Absolutely. In the long term probably economic chaos, in the short term, we are going to see more and more interest in leftist economic ideologies. Populism but on the left, like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. There will be an appetite for more and more redistribution
C: (1.000%) T: @TheMaxeroni @tictoc No the president is not responsible for any deaths outside of military action, if you believe that then you would have to believe the Dayton shooter was inspired by Elizabeth Warren and AOC
C: (1.000%) T: @TN_nyc @billyeichner @Equinox @soulcycle @PureYogaNYC Since when do NAZIs believe in capitalism? NAZIs are socialist. So ur willing to hurt ur friends cuz AOC and Elizabeth Warren were responsible for the mass shootings in Texas and Dayton?
C: (1.000%) T: I can understand if people have a different candidate they prefer, but I genuinely don‚Äôt get how any democrat could dislike Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.959%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren has already had a Dan if hers commit mass murder because of her hateful lies. Resign!!!
C: (1.000%) T: Thank you @ewarren @SenSanders @CoryBooker @JulianCastro for adding your support in making it clear that #WalmartMustAct https://t.co/dqXkXTCkzN
C: (0.988%) T: Warren ‚Äúdefinitely gives you teacher swag, but the teacher-that-cares-a-lot swag,‚Äù  https://t.co/pm6JQOFAXR
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a white supremacist.  Elizabeth Warren is white, so she is a white supremacist.   Elizabeth Warren pretended to be American Indian because she is a white supremacist.   Elizabeth Warren is a white supremacist because you can‚Äôt identify one unless you are one.
C: (1.000%) T: @davidhogg111 Lol actually he was a trump hater let‚Äôs talk about the Elizabeth Warren fan that shot up Dayton or how about the tranny and the gay kid that shot up the school I know the bleeding heart liberals üòÇ
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson You know who you haven‚Äôt smeared or insulted on Joy Reid‚Äôs show or in print? Elizabeth Warren. Why is that?
C: (1.000%) T: Can we all just make sure either Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris is the Dem candidate? Misogyny cost this country a lot in 2016. Is it really "too risky" to put forward qualified women candidates in the 21st century?  https://t.co/eJCxTMgKWn
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a white supremacist. I said  yes. AND A MORON.
C: (0.988%) T: @isabellegirlxo @AP Lol probably the same way Elizabeth Warren influenced the shooting in Dayton. Or AOC influenced the bomber in Tacoma.
C: (1.000%) T: Hmmm. I thought attacking the Media was a serious offense against the First A. I guess, as usual, it all depends on who's doing it. Elizabeth Warren attacks Fox News with video, fundraising  https://t.co/YtCWhPWnHP
C: (1.000%) T: y‚Äôall better not go and fuck this up for my girl elizabeth warren!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @PelosiSquadFive @yashar @lloydblankfein Historically in the US and outside the US, neoliberalism has always lead to an entry way for the far-right to institute strict austerity measures that throw thousands or even millions into poverty. We need someone on the left like Bernie Sanders or even Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @darthpooka @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Hey idiot you do realize the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter right? Low informed politicians elected by people like you.
C: (0.935%) T: Elizabeth Warren's mass shooter and the lies behind gun control @ewarren @BernieSanders @NCGOP #GunControlNow #gunrights  https://t.co/N3y6kyvsHb
C: (1.000%) T: If anyone's curious, I've donated to Elizabeth Warren twice. Feel free to tell anyone you want. https://t.co/rKtre0GVfb
