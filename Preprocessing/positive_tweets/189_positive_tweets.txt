C: (1.000%) T: So simple, yet it seems so many Americans lack any fundamental understanding of ethics and epistemology. America so desperately needs a professorial president. @ewarren https://t.co/9atEGrr7Nv
C: (1.000%) T: @JonahNRO Actually not telling the truth that both of the shooters were far left progressives and one was a Elizabeth Warren supporter is what is awful for this country. Every Democrat candidate parroting the same exact hateful rhetoric in the news is what’s awful for this country.
C: (1.000%) T: She's not the only one who is "non-pro-war".  In the debate last week, Elizabeth Warren proposed that we should "absorb" a First Strike without retaliation.  That's an open invitation to getting nuked.  And music to PUTIN's ears.  Tell me why PUTIN shot down MH17. https://t.co/aFauzrUOVE https://t.co/vxsrXop2v8
C: (0.987%) T: Elizabeth Warren stays coming out with a policy plans.
C: (1.000%) T: A poignant, thoughtful portrait of @ewarren, the teacher who still believes in America's potential: https://t.co/WBmRnBNqv3 This is great @rtraister, thank you.
C: (0.991%) T: The Dayton shooter was a huge ANTIFA supporter.  Big Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporter.  His manifesto sounded a lot like AOC - stop ICE, tear down the border fences, etc. https://t.co/qzkRVBTqOH
C: (1.000%) T: @SConley2525 @michellepoe11 @DonaldJTrumpJr It is public a public record. If you give to Trump and Don’t want your name published then Don’t donate. I give to Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Mayor Pete, and Amy Klobchaur. My name can be published at anytime. I am not ashamed of my donations.
C: (1.000%) T: This, from Elizabeth Warren's new agriculture plan out today, sure seems like a good reason to cut off subsidies to farmers, rather than expand efforts to preserve their businesses. https://t.co/HpAMNBorJ0
C: (0.994%) T: one of many things the #FakeNewsMedia is NOT telling people is that the #DaytonOhioShooter was a far-left antifa-loving-Elizabeth Warren supporter and that the crowd at which he was shooting was almost all black
C: (0.984%) T: This election cycle, I’ve given money to Elizabeth Warren, Julían Castro, and Jay Inslee. While this is public information, I also have no problem just telling people bc none of the candidates I gave money to are white nationalists.
C: (0.986%) T: @HenryTContreras @JoaquinCastrotx @kevinomccarthy So if a radical with a mental disorder like the Dayton shooter who was anti-Trump and supported Elizabeth Warren and just slaughtered folks, sees the list and picks someone out to do physical harm to will that be a good thing?

C: (0.548%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ I missed the sections of Elizabeth Warren's speeches where she rallied supporters to violence. Perhaps you could post a video? Or shut the fuck up? Either would be great.   *Thanks ;-)
C: (1.000%) T: “Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.”  @OANN https://t.co/NXHqUPZLSy
C: (1.000%) T: Surprise! @ewarren has a new plan. This time, it's an $85 billion push to expand broadband internet access in the US, and make it more affordable. https://t.co/HdyS0wwH7H

C: (0.997%) T: He should also link the El Paso shooter to himself then, fair? https://t.co/pTM2iBM9ao

C: (0.999%) T: @nick_the_knife @CBSNews What did I lie about?  The shooter was a supporter of Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren &amp; professed his affinity to the ideology of #Antifa.  What is untrue about that?
C: (0.978%) T: @conservativeTM1 @sai_by_sai @steph93065 @ryanobles @BernieSanders Did you see the president’s interview this morning? Damn, that man makes me proud. He even said that he didn’t blame Bernie or Elizabeth Warren for the other psycho path.
C: (0.999%) T: @repjohnlewis Well if that’s the standard Elizabeth warren can be directly blamed for Dayton and Bernie for the softball game and @AOC for the attack on the ice center if this is the road I want to go down and standards u want to set dems are doomed
C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren just unveiled a plan to spend $85 billion to bring internet service to underserved areas, along with proposals to restore net neutrality and crack down on what she calls "sneaky maneuvers" by broadband providers https://t.co/CxAEmYYsDb via @WIRED
C: (1.000%) T: @Lizzette007 @tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump @OANN Neither supported the President. The Dayton shooter was Antifa. He loved Elizabeth Warren.   The Texas guy is alive and talking all about it. He didn't support Trump.  He also did not write the manifesto.
C: (0.989%) T: Does Elizabeth Warren have a single plan that isn’t just fan-fiction for what a Democratic President would do with supermajorities of ultra-progressive Democrats in both houses of Congress?
C: (1.000%) T: ⁦@shannonrwatts⁩ In your opinion, which candidate has the most comprehensive approach to gun reform?  https://t.co/sQye63NAFD
