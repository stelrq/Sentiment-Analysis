C: (0.995%) T: @billmaher Umm, just vote for the Democrat.  Check my math:  Elizabeth Warren=Climate Fighter - Pesky Racism
C: (1.000%) T: @RepStevenSmith I don't agree with Elizabeth Warren but I don't agree with the people following you either.

C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is 1/1024th Native American. I said yes.
C: (0.766%) T: A very good 2020 take https://t.co/BbW7GhzuzL
C: (1.000%) T: @ursulafaw56 @tonyschwartz Elizabeth Warren. Biden will self-eliminate when his gaffes become the main story.
C: (0.989%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren is a former special ed teacher who has worked for decades to protect American consumers and represent the interests of ordinary people.   So, uh, no.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Yet it is clear for the whole world to see that Elizabeth Warren is none of those things.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren is like a psycho on the lose.  2nd Amendment guarantees  a American  Citizen has the right to bear Arms There is a United States Constitution involved here which people fought for. 1776.
C: (0.995%) T: I don't trust Elizabeth Warren at all.
C: (1.000%) T: Spotted my first Pete 2020 car sticker today, which means I've now seen local support for Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg. Pretty rad.
C: (1.000%) T: @BetteMidler Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter Friday that Michael Brown was “murdered” by a “white” policeman in Ferguson, Mo. This is an absolute whopper and obviously does nothing to calm racial tension in this country. Yet it’s gotten almost no coverage.
C: (0.997%) T: @tonyschwartz Absolutely right.  ELIZABETH WARREN will obliterate Trump.
C: (0.995%) T: @page88 Do you think 45 would lose his mind if we referred to all the candidates as president? • President Elizabeth Warren • President Kamala Harris • President Julian Castro  And so on...
C: (0.533%) T: @patrick_mooney @rezaaslan The shooter in Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, oh wait...facts mess up your whining narrative
C: (1.000%) T: @DiamondandSilk Elizabeth Warren wants to rewrite some laws.  Starting with guns.  Open borders.  Free health care.    So leave your house open and unlocked.   You can’t protect yourself anymore witn anything but a shovel.   And you have to pay for the burglars health care.   Sweet !
C: (1.000%) T: @spayer @PatriciaLavatai @LeeHolly81 @realDonaldTrump Well when Obama ran a lot of "stupid white men" as you put it thought he wasn't going to win... Look what happened to that... I believe with everything that's going on Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris have a very strong chance in becoming the next President and Vice president.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Soros funded the Ferguson riots, so I imagine he owns Elizabeth Warren, too.  Puppets are all too easy to spot.
C: (1.000%) T: If I knew I wouldn’t have to pay my student debt, I’d have chosen a better school and a more interesting but less lucrative major, writes @semanahte https://t.co/RZAuyFDUel
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr You need to keep your mouth off Elizabeth Warren. She’s wayyyy out of your league intellectually &amp; in every possible way. She has more guts than you &amp; your coward daddy combined. I’ll be glad when y’all are voted out of office! That will be one happy day!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @soledadobrien Oh, did Elizabeth Warren say something more today?
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Right!? Someone tell Elizabeth Warren to tax the hammer and baseball bat companies more so she can use the tax revenue to reduce the number of blunt force object deaths.
C: (0.956%) T: How sad the worst of the worst have qualified for Dem Sept debate:  Former VP Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar., Mayor Pete Buttigieg,  Beto O’Rourke,and Andrew Yang. How sad for America!
C: (1.000%) T: @DocMama22 @Jali_Cat @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Beto Mussolini O'Rourke, Kamala Harris, the native American Indian princess Elizabeth Warren and many more just like them, the so-called Democrat party should be declared a terrorist organization by "We The People" because they Do Not represent our Constitutional government.
C: (0.995%) T: Did someone say Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that? https://t.co/emrWbBMMSg
