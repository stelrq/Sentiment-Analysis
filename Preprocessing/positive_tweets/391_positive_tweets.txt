C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Your an idiot. Is Elizabeth Warren's rhetoric to blame for Dayton? Is the Media's constant barrage against white men to blame? Is every dem that has said all white people are racists to blame? Is everyone who wants to give free everything to illegals to blame?
C: (1.000%) T: @shaunking @BernieSanders Wrong answer - Elizabeth Warren is correct
C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano @MewllerRawr I pray you are wrong, because Bernie is the core of progressive politics &amp; other than Elizabeth Warren, the only one I trust to inspire a new Labor Movement in America.

C: (0.993%) T: @ArrowofArtemis @notcapnamerica @SenWarren Love Elizabeth Warren. I think she is the most brilliant person in Senate, but I was troubled by her dynamic with Trump.  I would love to see her as VP to Harris, with brief to "reconstruct" our poor, beat up federal government structure.  Including getting our scientists back!!
C: (0.999%) T: @skiprocks21 @washingtonpost Trump is no more responsible for the El Paso shooting than Elizabeth Warren is for the Dayton shooting....  separating children from their parents is required when the parents are going through criminal proceedings  I've addressed all your points You haven't answered my question

C: (1.000%) T: @valeriebuvat Elizabeth warren of your local library-you must choose one
C: (1.000%) T: The Democrats are being completely disingenuous. Trying to incite more riots in Ferguson. Michael Brown was an oversized young thug. The fact that he died violently shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone. Elizabeth Warren wants to now call it murder. She‚Äôs a crook
