C: (1.000%) T: @itspaulinaenck https://t.co/l9G1zos8WD Your article made me think deeper about this issue and helped me see things from a different perspective.  This is encouraging because Progressives and Conservatives should be able to have non-emotional intelligent convos about these issues

C: (1.000%) T: @weehalfpintt @sheologian @emrazz @SaraJaneOL @_c_h_ @ewarren That would have been a lovely question, and I bet Elizabeth Warren would have an answer to that question too. But it‚Äôs not what was asked. Her answer was spot on.

C: (1.000%) T: @RomanGriffen @ewarren No, today you made shit up on Twitter that you learned from a meme. This entire claim has been wildly debunked. You aren‚Äôt qualified to mop her office. She literally works to make life better for the people who trash her.   https://t.co/8Nn0tmGhbA
C: (0.984%) T: Haven‚Äôt heard about Elizabeth Warren since the Dayton shooting...
C: (1.000%) T: @Tom_Winter @KathyA11 Must be another one of those crazy Elizabeth Warren fans, right RWNJs? MAGA world is filled with twisters of reality.
C: (0.991%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants student loans to be cancelled - these are the loans that went to pay for her million dollar pay at Harvard. Maybe she and Harvard should be forced to disgorge. https://t.co/q22HPGDxOQ
C: (1.000%) T: @xdelmar59 When Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, or O‚ÄôRourke need an Anger Translator, you can start insisting Black women stand out in front. https://t.co/xx4hSIkCMy
C: (1.000%) T: I'm reading about Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. The former Harvard Law professor had her dogs with her during office hours‚Äîone dog even had HIS OWN office hours and this has changed my entire outlook on both office hours and Elizabeth Warren.   https://t.co/zYaQ6d5YMg
C: (1.000%) T: @JonFlan I think it could be Elizabeth Warren. I think Bobby would have agreed with fearless Elizabeth on a lot of stuff.
C: (0.594%) T: Have you heard. Establishment Democrats don't like Sen. Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs proposed wealth tax. No shit, Sherlock! Why would these wannabe Republicans, who put donors over voters, like it?
C: (0.989%) T: Is This Possible In The USA Today? Elizabeth Warren has a new plan to reduce gun violence by 80 percent - Vox https://t.co/ec4tujub6b
C: (0.995%) T: Warren's plan focuses on reducing gun deaths https://t.co/ffENOVpFWc JUST KICK her butt out of Congress.  We need people with a BRAIN in there !
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I love hearing that every time Elizabeth Warren talks about what a president can do she always says "what a president can do by HERSELF".  Think of all the young girls at home whose lives could change just by hearing someone say that they can do it.  #GunSenseForum
C: (0.995%) T: @Citizenroxanne @IBJIYONGI Warren claimed she was Cherokee based on unsubstantiated family legends going so far as marking Native American on job forms She refused to meet Cherokee geneologists about this then took a dna test when asked not to.  https://t.co/3vTUeavBJZ
C: (1.000%) T: @MarkYoungTruth Elizabeth Warren would stand with Jack the Rioper if she thought it would get her some votes.i pinky promise that‚Äôs true.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST RACIST POTUS IN HISTORY! What we need is to elect @SenWarren to solve all of our countries problems,  only Elizabeth Warren can end gun violence and trade wars, only Elizabeth Warren can free the kids in cages at our borders!! #Warren2020 https://t.co/OlkK7eUqFb
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/tmWryRLP9f: Elizabeth Warren has a new plan to reduce gun violence by 80 percent.  Im not sold yet, still very light on the preventative side.  But I appreciate her understanding the complexity of the issue.  #2020Elections  https://t.co/xvw3HPjBxE  via @GoogleNews
C: (1.000%) T: @NBCLA Shouldn't be surprising since the Dayton shooter was a supporter of Antifa and Elizabeth Warren also Bernie Sanders. Birds of a feather flock together.
C: (0.995%) T: @DrJasonJohnson We love you guys! And we love your candidate, Elizabeth Warren, too!
C: (1.000%) T: A few hours into the Everytown forum, Elizabeth Warren easily has the strongest, most natural rapport with this audience of anyone who's done the Q&amp;A so far. Praising the questions, answering directly (not just with sound bites), and remembering the questioner's name at the end.

C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks about taking on the NRA (as many candidates today have) and the organizations that work with it. She calls out Wells Fargo for banking w NRA, says activists can use power of the purse to push for change #iacaucus
C: (1.000%) T: @Citizenroxanne @IBJIYONGI Basically, @ewarren claimed Native American ancestry publicly &amp; repeatedly without directly engaging with native people. She‚Äôs apologized, but for a person of her power and stature, this is not nearly enough. https://t.co/Lf5Ixwle4U
