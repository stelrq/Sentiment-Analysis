C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren So now Elizabeth Warren would not only write the laws, she'd sign them into law and to hell with what Americans want. We can read this evil woman's tweets and see she wants absolute power. Anyone getting in her way will be stripped of their means of resistance. It's frightening.

We need to fumigate WH first, clean out all the listening devices DT let his Russian buddies plant, clean &amp; vacuum the carpets (old men) and get rid of the white tr*sh decorating scheme. Elizabeth Warren can enter safely as she hits the ground running to fix this govt.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is our best shot of getting people like you out of making decisions for Americans. She is fighting for middle class Americans, unlike you and yours and we all know it! https://t.co/XjuVE4DVJ3
C: (1.000%) T: @brycetache @ewarren Elizabeth Warren would make an outstanding president.  She is smart, experienced, &amp; knows her way around government.  Plus she‚Äôs an excellent campaigner who can deal with trump &amp; his lies.  But let us not forget, even when defeated in 2020, trump will maintain an evil presence.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a racist I said yes, she pretended to be American Indian for most of her life, she put American Indian on her college apps her job apps,she used a fake ancestry to get where she is today, that is despicable, imagine if Trump did it.
C: (1.000%) T: If elected  Elizabeth Warren will make big structural change.   Kamala Harris will fight For The People.   Joe Biden will restore the soul of our nation.   Bernie Sanders will not be for his self he will be for us.   Marianne Williamson will heal our nation  Democrats don‚Äôt lie.
C: (1.000%) T: @TruNewsUSA @KamalaHarris No, it wasn't.  Joe Biden's, Pete Buttigeig's, and Elizabeth Warren's jars are EACH more full than Trump's, and Kamala Harris' is AS full as Trump's. If you pick just one of those four, their jar would be overflowing.  Trump is doomed.
C: (1.000%) T: @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I misspelled "threw". I'm OCD about such things. Color my face red. Wait ... Elizabeth Warren  might have that notion cornered.
