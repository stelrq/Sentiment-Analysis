C: (0.990%) T: Hey Black and Brown people I‚Äôm probably going to vote for Elizabeth Warren. What‚Äôs the wave??
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired ‚Äì https://t.co/gyyWUGhdnI https://t.co/mHqIuWeFCx
C: (0.996%) T: @in_pubs @realDonaldTrump The Daytona Shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie and did not like Trump.  So there's that.    Stop blaming video games.  If that was the case, 50 years ago we would have this problem because of cartoons.  So just stop it.  Tweets like yours are part of the problem.
C: (1.000%) T: @SaintPernicious @Hoosiers1986 @ksparky13 @ewarren Oh yes she did. In fact in her Harvard application she listed her heritage as American Indian. She was hired by Harvard to teach only one class for over $400,000 per year. Elizabeth Warren is part of the problem with high college tuitions. You are the moron here.
C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren implored Walmart to "do the right thing ‚Äî stop selling guns," in response to the El Paso shooting: "Companies that sell guns have a responsibility to the safety of their communities." https://t.co/SMHkryUinI via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Not an Elizabeth Warren fan, but good for the kids.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Hue hue just coming across this frosty cold one with Big Chief Elizabeth Warren totally out of the blue and not because I was hiding in her underwear drawer hue hue

C: (1.000%) T: @sherrilee7 Nope. I think Elizabeth Warren would be an amazing leader for our country.
C: (0.690%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren laid it on the line when she was asked if she believed Donald Trump is a white supremacist. https://t.co/lq3ZRnaRBc via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren should be the president.   There are some other good options (Bernie, Castro, Inslee) but honestly, it's really not even close.
C: (1.000%) T: This is a silly format for a tweet.  Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is a kumquat. I said yes. https://t.co/etyyFPLQCv
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked who is the dumbest person running for President ? My answer is Elizabeth Warren . Can you explain to me who is responsible for the mass shooting before Trump was elected ? https://t.co/xoH1BrBEmt
C: (1.000%) T: in this follow-up to my article about warren's lack of support for m4a, i thanked her for standing with bernie at the first debate but said she needed to do more to fight for it. she's not doing great! https://t.co/RGePvxEdpu
C: (1.000%) T: @Bleepitybloop @garthstapley1 Wasn‚Äôt the Dayton shooter a huge Elizabeth warren support who hated ice. The congressional officers shot during a baseball game shot by Bernie support. The El Paso shooter. Shot randomly. It‚Äôs not like he went into a Mexican church. Guess we should blame Obama for these https://t.co/8EYflT8WBk
C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren's mass shooter/ Lies behind Gun¬†Control https://t.co/MCzQzrGKKG
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill The mirror of inner beliefs and thoughts of Elizabeth Warren. This is not just another #liberalslie but an insight to their own deeply held feelings projected upon another group they hate even more; pro Constitution Americans.
C: (0.988%) T: @nationalparke @LoveEachother14 Elizabeth Warren @ewarren  2020  Zero billionaires supporting her.
C: (1.000%) T: 10 yrs ago w/ Mississippi Records I made Canary #1, A String of Pearls, dedicated to Jason DiEmliio. Then I made its follow-up Brass Pins &amp; Match Heads dedicated to Jack Rose. Until Jan 1 2020 proceeds from this redux of those will go to  Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/MOELMihb1H
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's 'honest answer': Donald Trump is a white supremacist https://t.co/hjzOCYxKpx
C: (1.000%) T: @DigiVorr @travisakers @Ksweetsoap @ewarren Not in August 2019 it isn't, lol.  What you fail to mention is that Elizabeth Warren is the only top Democratic contender with upwards momentum. Funny, because every news story about the Monmouth University Iowa caucus poll made that its lead.
C: (0.989%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren @DMRegister Elizabeth Warren is a DEMO‚ÄùCRAP‚Äù LIAR ü§• or if you prefer, a LYING DEMO‚ÄùCRAP‚Äù who is incapable of telling the TRUTH. https://t.co/BM3qNpTugs
C: (0.996%) T: @akawatermusic @TassajaraRd @RepDougCollins @JulianCastro Your sick! If 100 million Americans were racist, trust me you would know it! This blame game is all because your Russia narrative blew up! Dayton shooter was Antifa and an Elizabeth Warren supporter! Her fault? Idiot!
