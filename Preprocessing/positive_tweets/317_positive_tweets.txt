C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro Probably the first time Elizabeth Warren has spent her own money rather than ours. Cause for celebration. Glad she left a tip. It‚Äôs rare among Leftists, the cheapest people on Earth.

C: (1.000%) T: "It's just one piece of evidence after another," Sen. Elizabeth Warren says when asked why called Pres. Trump a white supremacist.  "When he has been so embraced by the white supremacists and has not distanced himself, then he's there." https://t.co/JCOWwlrgxQ https://t.co/wHekshRijJ
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions Still can't believe that Elizabeth Warren said that the shooter's brother and random people at a bar in Dayton were an "invasion," made jokes about her supporters shooting random people in a bar in Dayton, and sent the military to Dayton.
C: (0.649%) T: @TrumpWarRoom This is ridiculous!  Donald Trump is more responsible for the deaths in Texas than Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the deaths in Ohio!  The only person responsible is person holding the gun.  Trump is not a racist because he wants secure boarders.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren You cover Elizabeth Warren. You just happened to come across this?  I used to cover the World Series. I just happened to come across baseball games.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's team travels to rural communities to listen to the issues those living in the communities care about.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeding your ideas directly up to HQ, so whatever you tell me has the potential to influence this campaign.‚Äù  #TeamWarren  https://t.co/sDkS1DJ38s

C: (0.969%) T: @IlhanMN One of those shooters was a follower of Elizabeth Warren, and the democratic bullshit that you‚Äôve been pushing. Please explain that to us!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is surging. This one big question looms over her. [‚ÄúElectability‚Äù is not a real thing. Trump didn‚Äôt have it and he still won. The term reflects willful ignorance of political dynamics at worst and cluelessness of pundits at best.]  https://t.co/J25oNMjTw8
