C: (1.000%) T: Stories about campaign field operations -- like this one https://t.co/hyAmoyzVE8 -- are important for a few reasons, even they are a bit short on hard data. A thread
C: (0.990%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN I would blame Senator Warren if she had been using violent rhetoric and tried to rally her base and raise money by stoking fears about an invasion. Elizabeth Warren didn't light the match you did. You built that.
C: (0.997%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Where was the Dayton shooters manifesto citing Elizabeth Warren's tweets to justify killing people?    A killers political leanings don't matter unless it's the reason they killed people.  The El Paso shooter killed because of the lies you've spread.   The blood is on your hands
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Well, they were clearly right to change it. You're certainly not "urging unity" NOW.  The editor probably looked at that headline and said, "Are you kidding me? This is TRUMP we're talking about. He'll be on Twitter in a day attacking Elizabeth Warren for being a terrorist."
C: (1.000%) T: ICYMI ‚ÄúAfter her second debate performance last week, CNN commentator Van Jones told Warren, ‚ÄúYou make me feel like help is on the way ‚Ä¶ You make me feel good.‚Äù What she‚Äôs offering is belief ‚Äî in her students, the audience, voters.‚Äù ‚Å¶@rtraister‚Å©  https://t.co/Kgk1AYRzbf
C: (0.987%) T: @charliekirk11 Both shooters supported Elizabeth Warren!
C: (0.985%) T: @iamcardib Fucking lier. The Dayton Ohio was inspired by Elizabeth Warren....
C: (1.000%) T: @Albertylaw Soooo..... The Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, as well as ANTIFA. Why no clarion call against the leftists?
C: (1.000%) T: That Lisa Marie/Michael Jackson kiss was a natural as Elizabeth Warren drinking a beer.   #PutThatInYourPipe
C: (0.979%) T: @MichellesDude @booondm @JasonSCampbell And someone quotes AOC or Elizabeth warren, try‚Äôs to blow up a government building or shoots up a bar, but it‚Äôs not AOC or Elizabeth warrens fault. Weird how that works.
C: (1.000%) T: @JeremyDBoreing @benshapiro I guess Democrats literally think this thing no one said... here's a video of Elizabeth Warren not saying it to prove my point... I'm doing journalism!
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Democrats jumped on writing the narrative, and now they're silent about the Dayton shooter. The difference is the right isn't blaming AOC,  or Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.985%) T: @TheDailyEdge @realDonaldTrump @OANN A Twitter account appearing to be from the gunman who killed nine people in Dayton, Ohio, showed tweets labeling himself a ‚Äúleftist,‚Äù bemoaning the election of President Donald Trump, supporting Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: The mayor of Dayton has encouraged people to protest Pres. Trump‚Äôs arrival, when he comes to pay his respects to the victims of the recent shooting. Is this her way of changing the subject that the shooter was a Leftist Bernie &amp; Elizabeth Warren supporter? https://t.co/oC8lCBCaEC
C: (0.997%) T: @FrankFigliuzzi1 Neither of the shooters were white supremacist. One of them claimed to follow Elizabeth Warren so does that make her an accomplice too.
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN True - however one of the terrorists was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, Antifa fan and all around ICE hating progressive .
C: (0.603%) T: @NiceAmericaBear Elizabeth Warren wins 2019 ‚ÄòHow long can you hold your breath contest‚Äô
C: (1.000%) T: @NBCNews He supported Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris Bernie Sanders and planned on voting for Elizabeth Warren. This doesn‚Äôt fit the MSM narrative that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt want to report about the Dayton shooter.
C: (1.000%) T: Half of the Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who watched Sen. Elizabeth Warren debate in July said their opinions of her improved. https://t.co/VrlXTjVsdc
C: (1.000%) T: As I was doxxing myself on https://t.co/mxH6vQuqIh I realized I was behind small dollar but regularly donating to Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.581%) T: @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump Wrong again the left wing liberals who pulled the trigger did. One was a tree hugger and the other was a Elizabeth Warren nut
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN What does his supporting well balanced people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have to do with his killing spree? Please elucidate.
C: (1.000%) T: @cerothstein I agree he was in Elizabeth Warren supporter make sure you Democrats do not elect Elizabeth Warren for president!
C: (0.986%) T: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Elizabeth Warren is a fruit cake... https://t.co/FDsO1OYWhu
C: (0.975%) T: @KayDA26 How did Trumps rhetoric incite  El Paso, yet Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt responsible for Dayton?
