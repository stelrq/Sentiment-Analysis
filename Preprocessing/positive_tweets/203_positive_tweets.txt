C: (1.000%) T: How does one formally invite Elizabeth Warren to visit their classroom this is for entirely selfish purposes
C: (1.000%) T: @WilliamsEd8 @pinkhouse60 @CindyKendrick11 Give me one good reason Trump should be worried about any of the over 20 losers the dems have came up with, Elizabeth Warren couldn't hold a conversation with POTUS
C: (1.000%) T: @MalcolmNance @JoeBiden IDGAS. Elizabeth Warren is starting to warm my heart. She speaks Truth to Power. Sorry, but I'm done with men running shit. They've totally F'd things up. At least white men have. I want a woman running things and not one who acts like a man. Forget that shyte

C: (1.000%) T: I bet your absurd salary for a teaching gig at Harvard doesn't help, you were paid $430k from 2010 to 2011. You and professors like you are the main reason tuition rates are so high. #Warren2020 https://t.co/8fk6n9Ll3L
C: (1.000%) T: Trump changed his name to "Elizabeth Warren?" I didn't see that one coming. https://t.co/urIajtPzLd
C: (0.950%) T: @USFRA On 8/7/2019, Elizabeth Warren tweeted:  "Agriculture has become one of the biggest polluters in our economy, thanks to decades of failed policy. By paying farmers to fight climate change and investing in R&amp;D we can tackle climate change."  WARNING! It's a farm takeover!
C: (1.000%) T: @cree_lotterer @rai_close Def not pulling for Tulsi, was just hoping to consider the male-centric view that we all hold if we aren‚Äôt constantly checking ourselves. Someone who has done those things? Elizabeth Warren. Best regards.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump None of them are qualified. Elizabeth Warren has the energy and willingness to work but she still a damn socialist! The rest of them are just full of hate and getting their feelings hurt (Something to do with riding or not riding a school bus a child.) None qualified.
C: (1.000%) T: @nanwhaley Glad to see that you won't be "acting out" during the President's visit.   But you need to be corrected on your latest comment: The President didn't "make this bed". Your shooter was a leftist loon who supported Elizabeth Warren.  So stop with the politicized commentary. Please.
C: (1.000%) T: Having read Warren's student Note on the Detroit public school integration case I was impressed.  But this NY magazine profile and podcast are a must read. https://t.co/giB6R5Jjl3
C: (0.994%) T: Senator Warren is old enough to remember when Fox blamed every single crime committed on Obama. @ewarren #foxnews #trump #hypocrites https://t.co/KIG5zfFrmf

C: (0.697%) T: @robreiner And the slaughter in Dayton in the name of Elizabeth Warren.......
C: (1.000%) T: @brianstelter So what is your theory about the Dayton shooter? Who radicalized him? He is a leftist Antifa Elizabeth Warren supporter. Do you and all the other members of the left accept responsibility for radicalizing the Dayton shooter? What ideology does he follow? Look in the mirror man!
C: (0.984%) T: üö® Elizabeth Warren has a plan to celebrate @lorenzalramirez on this day of her birth üö®  First, we will (continue to) follow her anywhere https://t.co/X3GqSScLji
C: (1.000%) T: I hope everyone is sufficiently ready to begin their morning was this assertion from a Trump fan that the real problem was Elizabeth Warren is that she is a liar. https://t.co/SVbvnLyJBj
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Grow the f*** up boy. Do you even know what racism means anymore? Let talk about the mass shooting in Ohio, by your way of thinking, it must be Bernie's &amp; Elizabeth Warren's fault. Piss off Beta. https://t.co/ss8x0G5k1w
C: (1.000%) T: @ReaganBattalion @jaketapper We have OVER 3K from inner city non-white supremacy shootings to prove you only care about CERTAIN kinds of shootings... those you can virtue signal on.   https://t.co/LrpRwqFDym
C: (0.989%) T: @JoeNBC I'm a monthly donor to Elizabeth Warren and proud as hell to admit it.
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù
C: (0.970%) T: I almost missed my stop because I was reading this amazing @rtraister profile of Elizabeth Warren.  https://t.co/FtsVeSaCI5
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren. Please. One of the domestic terrorists supported you and I haven‚Äôt heard you take responsibility. If that shooting isn‚Äôt your fault then the others aren‚Äôt Trumps. You don‚Äôt get to pick and choose when to show blame. Gosh.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: 'I will do every thing I can by executive order' on gun controls https://t.co/gxM8dtBcE8
