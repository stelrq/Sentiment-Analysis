C: (1.000%) T: The reason I support Bernie Sanders over Elizabeth Warren is that, judging by Washington's reaction to both candidates political moves and opinions, (i.e. M4A, no corporate money, etc.) they really don't care about Warren, but are absolutely terrified of Sanders.

C: (0.519%) T: Elizabeth Warren is a disgusting fraud. She knows what she is saying here is a complete lie yet she can‚Äôt pass up an opportunity to exploit a racially charged event from 5 years ago in an attempt to frighten people into voting for her. I am sorry for your loss. https://t.co/fVWk1IzLbU
C: (1.000%) T: @tedleo I think Biden is the right vehicle for a 12 year Dem White House. 1 term Biden + 2 terms with Biden VP (Elizabeth Warren) as President.
C: (1.000%) T: @nanwhaley How can you sleep at night lady you blame President Trump for your shooting in your town the person was Elizabeth Warren Democrat supporter that is disrespectful to the victims and their families you should be ashamed and I hope they vote you out of office next year I

C: (1.000%) T: @CNN @CNNOpinion Yeah bc the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren and I‚Äôm sure propaganda MSM doesn‚Äôt want to report that
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden Connor Betts, the Dayton, Ohio mass killer was a radical Democrat socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren.  He wrote: ‚ÄúI want socialism, and i‚Äôll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding.‚Äù https://t.co/cYxR3hIuip
C: (0.546%) T: Why haven't Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren apologized for this socialist murderer &amp; their supporter? &amp; why hasn't Bernie Sanders also apologized for his supporter &amp; that shot up the GOP Congress Baseball team? https://t.co/ztKngAm3O4
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis By that logic we can now go ahead and BLAME Bernie Sanders for the shooting of Republicans on that baseball field AND Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton Ohio shootings. Well, there ya go. Sound reasonable to you John? ü•¥

C: (1.000%) T: Was it appropriate for Donald Trump to say the Dayton shooter supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @ArtMiller9 @diggetydog68 @BarkingGallery @standing_trump @Cernovich @JoaquinCastrotx @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @TexasGOP @TexasGOPVote Just as Hillary Clinton broke the law, notice that Democrats seem to think she doesn't need to be held accountable. Or Maxine Waters and the fact that the shooter in Dayton was noted supporter of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.999%) T: Just as some blame Trump for the violence in El Paso, as that shooter‚Äôs manifesto praised the president, similar logic would place blame for Dayton on Sen. Elizabeth Warren. But neither is intellectually justifiable: https://t.co/EdKS8rCn2W
C: (1.000%) T: What about the mass slaughters in Dayton by the ANTIFA FOLLOWING ELIZABETH WARREN FAN Connor Betts? Can we talk about him? https://t.co/opm7fw2AfU
C: (1.000%) T: @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump You're ridiculous. FYI the 100 round Drum that Ohio shooter had? Yeah, they're ALREADY ILLEGAL! So ask yourself how did this REGISTERED ELIZABETH WARREN LOVING DEMOCRAT get his hands on something illegal? Let's make more laws so these things are MORE ILLEGAL.  #PeopleKillNotGuns
C: (1.000%) T: @politico "Vermont Senator Elizabeth Warren dominates in small donors and was the first presidential candidate to have a unionized staff. If elected, she would stand to be the first Jewish president in American history."  This is what you sound like
