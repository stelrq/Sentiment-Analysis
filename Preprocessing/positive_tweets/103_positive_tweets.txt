C: (0.883%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, not only was the guy a complete asshole he also had terrible taste
C: (0.983%) T: @DREAMER7712 @realDonaldTrump The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and wanna know who I blame? The shooter! And that's who you should blame because that's who did the action!
C: (1.000%) T: @Jess_x5 Nah, he had that one day where he sounded like Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.736%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump And the shooter that's a hardcore leftist and Elizabeth Warren supporter do you blame her of course you don't. You're logic like you is flawed.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr Elizabeth Warren,  have you publicly asked the @senatemajIdr to get senators BACK from vacation to pass gun control legislation?  I haven't heard!
C: (0.982%) T: @juxtaposedJJ @JeffHJR87 AOC and Elizabeth Warren incited another mass shooter...  no coverage
C: (0.995%) T: Elizabeth Warren Proposes A Public Option For The Internet #SmartNews   This is my Lady!  I love her ideas!  https://t.co/KG2HpsxUsO
C: (1.000%) T: @RepMaxineWaters The shooter in dayton was an antifa follower, Bernie sanders and elizabeth warren supporter so please clarify your narative.
C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker  It is disgusting and disgraceful how you are using tragedy to try to gain political points. There were 2 shootings, however you seem to be focusing on El Paso.  I wonder why? Is it because the Ohio shooter was a Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Antifa supporter? https://t.co/DK021hbfVo
C: (0.520%) T: @robreiner After the mass slaughter in Dayton, OH. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders keep fanning the flames of the ultra violent left. The Democratic candidates for President have no soul. We are staring into the face of evil.
C: (1.000%) T: @SportySpice666 @JackFreyling @ByEliott No, you try again.  The Dayton shooter was a Leftist Elizabeth Warren supporter. Maybe you should go protest her?
C: (1.000%) T: @ndrew_lawrence Actually he is an avowed leftist who stated HIS ATTACK WAS INSPIRED BY THE DEMOCRAT DEBATES!!! Google it. He admitted this. The Dayton shooter swore allegiance to Antifa and loved Elizabeth Warren. Both HATED Trump. Care to try that again? I REFUSE to let the left lie about this
C: (1.000%) T: Dems, can we agree that Elizabeth Warren is the candidate that best represents our values and collectively support her ü•∞ https://t.co/hUDJDsRMFp
C: (1.000%) T: @keanothedog @realDonaldTrump He wasn‚Äôt a white nationalist. He was a satanist and an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @MoveOn Notice how all these liberal run sites stopped calling the dayton shooter a white supremacist when it was found out that hes an Elizabeth warren and bernie supporter and an overall Democratic supporter? Yea, they arent touching that now. Just talking about the gun now. Figures
C: (1.000%) T: Is this true? : The Ohio shooter, Conner Bretts, wrote on Twitter that he would happily vote for Democrat Elizabeth Warren, praised Satan, was upset about the 2016 presidential election results, and added, ‚ÄúI want socialism, and i‚Äôll not wait for the idiots to finally come round

C: (1.000%) T: @ValueAnalyst1 ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù @OANN  I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Yet Geraldo one of these men aspire to be following the Democrats from their debates and also a Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren follower. How do you justify your comments?
C: (0.975%) T: National Media spends most time on El Paso shooter since Dayton Ohio shooter was a leftist, anti gun, Elizabeth Warren supporter. Truth will come on El Paso shooter. Media will find something new to report. Is Jerry Epstein still in jail, or did he get out?
C: (1.000%) T: @ShupingSydney @Deena_Zaru And? no no no better yet say Welcome Elizabeth Warren we have followers here that would just kill to see you!
C: (0.570%) T: @MaryMargOlohan @DailyCaller The El Paso shooter is a radical green deal finatic who happens to be racist. The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, just plain nuts, no agenda. Media misconstrued, as usual.
C: (0.539%) T: @homunculoid1 @charliespiering @kaitlancollins "Conald" instigated an Elizabeth Warren loving, socialist, pro-gun control Antifa supporter to go on a shooting rampage?
C: (1.000%) T: @hannahwanebo @AndrewHllard @yesnicksearcy @benshapiro @tedcruz So what about the Dayton shooter? And Elizabeth Warren lover, Antifa member? Oh wait that doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative does it?
C: (1.000%) T: @BorowskiCyndi @LetsTwe84498325 @GermTex @MitchKSmith So a known Antifa supporter and Elizabeth warren follower is acting out for white supremacy? Seems a little off beat for those two intersections considering one hates trump the other hates everyone
