C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Actually, Elizabeth Warren is tougher on China than you - but you don‚Äôt want America to know that.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a follower, not a leader. She repeats falsehoods made by many even when the facts are in her face.  P.S. President Trump leads with truth no matter how unpopular it is. Now that is what a President &amp; Leader should do.
C: (0.965%) T: @llilith @YourMarkLubbers It's so true. It's just so hard to get behind anyone politician. I mean I think the cleanest people we have available might be Elizabeth Warren and Mike Buttigieg (sp) &amp; maybe Kamala Harris. Biden and Bernie just have too much baggage. Too old! Need new blood
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has clearly never read the constitution.  #freedom #MAGA #hitlerwasasocialist https://t.co/646Fm8JsWR
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to make sure Americans get slide
C: (1.000%) T: @mike_mkxpress Yes, my favs are @KamalaHarris and @JoeBiden  BUT @ewarren  is a Fav too. Actually, I give Elizabeth Warren the edge over Biden. We are very fortunate to have so many good candidates! I like @BetoORourke @JulianCastro and  @AndrewYang
C: (0.998%) T: @DanCrenshawTX @MochaLite What white supremacy? The Dayton shooter was a fan of Socialism, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The shooters at San Bernandino, the Pulse Nightclub and Fort Hood were all Middle Eastern and Muslim. The Virginia Tech shooter was Asian.  White supremacy again???
C: (0.624%) T: @SRuhle Have they always been there &amp; they never exposed themselves? Example- Jeff Sessions. Remember Coretta Scott Kings letter? Remember Elizabeth Warren trying to read it on the Senate floor &amp; McConnell stoped her through threats?
C: (1.000%) T: @DineshDSouza Question : does Elizabeth warren ever wear anything but black top black slacks and a colored jacket ???

C: (0.985%) T: That makes Warren, Beto and Sanders who have called Trump a white supremacist or white nationalist. I see no lie: "Elizabeth Warren Calls Trump a White Supremacist" https://t.co/4QGsHvKpn9

C: (1.000%) T: 1. Your bio says you cover elizabeth warren so not sure that you ‚Äúhappened to come across‚Äù her. Secondly, who the hell sells lemonade for $7? Thirdly, $15 minimum wage may actually make a paper cup of lemonade cost $7. Brilliance all around. https://t.co/mdW27raY9V
C: (1.000%) T: I think that Elizabeth Warren's campaign has pretty masterfully marketed her to people who want to be perceived as intelligent.  I don't even know if I agree with her platform the most. I just know that she's the smart one and if you want to be smart you pick the smart one.
C: (1.000%) T: Kamala Harris has dropped in the polls after the second debate, while Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren sit atop the pack. How do these candidates feel about Jewish issues and Israel? Check out our Jewish Guide to U.S. Politics and find out. https://t.co/mr2S53dJTW

C: (1.000%) T: @RobertJUlm1 @TuckerCarlson That could be true, but one side has Elizabeth Warren and the other side has #DonTheCon and #MoscowMitch. I choose Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @washingtonpost Do u hold Dayton Ohio mass shooters accountable when they support Elizabeth warren? Maybe we should boycott and accuse her of inciting that shooting? Or Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters/staffers shot republican congressmen?
