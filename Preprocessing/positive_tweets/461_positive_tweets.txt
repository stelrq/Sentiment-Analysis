C: (1.000%) T: @jchaltiwanger @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump Are you really that dense??  It exists as a small fringe group, and is condemned. Now let’s talk about the violent Antifa, supported by the left. They have attacked and both El Paso and Dayton shooters supported, as well as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporters.
