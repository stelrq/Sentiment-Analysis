C: (0.989%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Tell me, you false-equivalencies peddler; has Elizabeth Warren ever called anyone a snarky nickname? Has she ever longed for the good ol‚Äô days when guys got punched? Has she called ANY RACE rapists, criminals, sub-human, infesting...? No? Then stop this BS. Open your eyes &amp; ears.

C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≥I thought this was your day to heal the nation and end the divisiveness in America now.  Your twitter attacks yesterday:  Tim O'Brien Joaquin Castro Democrats Sherrod brown Mayor Whaley Biden Nadler  The Federal Reserve  Bernie Sanders  Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @RhutaBhayga2 @Franklin_Graham People kill people. If you want to look at medis sources that advertise hate look at the liberal establishments. That is all they talk about. Also, one of the shooters supported Elizabeth Warren and was a liberal! He was filled with hate yet the media does not report him!

C: (1.000%) T: @chrissyteigen People like you are dangerous and reckless because you use your fame for ill reasons. I don't watch your NBC show because I believe there are more qualified black female comdians who deserve the spot. And are you doing the same for Elizabeth Warren donors. #soulesscycle

C: (1.000%) T: @ABC The president has ordered gags on Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to prevent future shootings like the one in Dayton.
C: (1.000%) T: @Greg_Palast @Thom_Hartmann How do you account for the Dayton shooter giving props to Bernie and Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren calls Trump a white supremacist  https://t.co/HMzlbwrgK9 we all know one thing Warren is not really Pocahontas,she lied cheated &amp; jumped in front of thousands by claiming heritage of Indian!Ole Warren is just like poor ole senile Bernie with million $$ castles
C: (1.000%) T: The question is where is your sympathy after the mass slaughter in Dayton by a rabid, left-wing nut (like you) who was an Elizabeth Warren supporter? Why isn't the left-wing mass murderer the face of evil in your biased eyes? You really are one sick SOB. https://t.co/gKDXirt7YW
C: (1.000%) T: @CWonderdog @steph93065 @PeteButtigieg Explain how Trump is to blame for the shootings!  The Dayton shooter was a Democrat and a Elizabeth Warren supporter who heard voices in his head, among other things.  The El Paso shooter was inspired by the Democratic candidates running for president. https://t.co/i64MAFwFkS
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx So why don‚Äôt you post the Elizabeth Warren supporters? The shooter in Dayton was a fan of hers. You have just created a hit/harassment list and if anything happens to anyone you named I hope you are sued into poverty. Your very Sad! üá∫üá∏
C: (0.989%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI The shooter in Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  Nice try
C: (1.000%) T: By Joaquin Castro‚Äôs theory it‚Äôs Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs fault that the people in Dayton were killed right? What a hypocrite. Maybe if politicians shut up and stop using race as their political weapon people won‚Äôt become radicals either way https://t.co/NKcfzarat3

C: (1.000%) T: @TaraSetmayer @CNNOpinion Yet... The mainstream media (and you apparently) have already all but forgotten about Dayton shooter because he was a socialist Elizabeth Warren supporter that doesn't fit your narrative. So.... Is Tucker really wrong?
C: (1.000%) T: @nhdogmom @Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump you really dont have a clue, do you ? the Dayton shooter was a DEVOUT LIBERAL, who supported ANTIFA-a pure terrorist group run by Liberals, and he was a rabid Elizabeth Warren follower.  where is your outrage at that ?  oh right.. you have none. youre a drone. no mind of your own
