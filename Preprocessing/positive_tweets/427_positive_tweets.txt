C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren This is for the information of Elizabeth Warren Opinion | The physical evidence in the Michael Brown case supported the officer [updated with DNA evidence] https://t.co/J3orffFMCo
C: (0.980%) T: @C_may93 There are sicko people everywhere. The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Trump has done more for this country that the last three Presidents combined. #TrumpLandslide2020
C: (0.985%) T: @VanDea5 @tekulvesmith @jmgallo @TeoMontilla @JohnFromCranber @ewarren @SenWarren Elizabeth Warren inspired Connor Betts, the Dayton Shooter who went to a Trump supporting bar in Dayton &amp; shot people up https://t.co/zGfMrnL4xM
C: (1.000%) T: “Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.” I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!
C: (0.984%) T: This is an incredible piece https://t.co/9gvRR9QHe6
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‘murdered by a white police officer’ https://t.co/6dEp43ZA5r
C: (1.000%) T: @RashidaTlaib It is time people started following around Democrats then post their home addresses - Especially Rashida's and Joaquin and his brothers and the "Squad" and Booker and Maxine Waters and Elizabeth Warren since they feel harassing people is ok - give it BACK!
C: (0.988%) T: @camanpour @RepKarenBass Well then, I guess it's Elizabeth Warren's fault for what happened in Dayton according to your IQ.
C: (0.989%) T: @seankent Yo Dumbass, Forgetting about Dayton? Elizabeth Warren supporter gunman? You can't blame President Trump for El Paso, (even though he disliked Both Parties), while ignoring Dayton, E Warren supporter. #DemocratMediaComplexStooge. Do You Ever think for Yourself? #FactsMatter
C: (1.000%) T: Things losers say: “if you look at Dayton, that was a person that supported, I guess you would say, Bernie Sanders I understood, antifa I understood, Elizabeth Warren I understood — had nothing to do with President Trump.”  https://t.co/vLKfrgDK2w
C: (1.000%) T: @ndrew_lawrence And the shooter in Dayton was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren. And there were over 55 incidents of blacks shooting other blacks in Chicago over the weekend.  I get it. Doesn’t fit your narrative.
C: (1.000%) T: my bf’s parents live in an area out of range of the only internet provider in town, they own a small business, and they had to drive levi’s grandpa into columbus for care... and this plan is so so good. it’s so good for them. I love this plan I love elizabeth warren. https://t.co/ArsS3xbeCR
C: (1.000%) T: @ChuckUF06228465 @TimMurtaugh @TwitterSupport one shooter: - Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders supporter - ANTIFA member  other shooter: - pro UBI - climate change lunatic - consumed with overpopulation (this is his stated reason for hating immigrants) - hates GOP - hates big business  Sound like left wing lunatics to me.
C: (1.000%) T: @BrandonStraka @KLSouth Mayor Peter Pan thinks the Dayton shooter was a “white nationalist”? In fact, the Dayton shooter was a registered Democrat leftist who also supported Antifa. And, a huge Elizabeth Warren supporter. Mayor Peter Pan plunders and panders his progressive pedagogy to unwitting people.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx Should post the names of all the business' that donate to Elizabeth Warren.  Antifa supporters should be listed, since the Ohio shooter was big time follower of Antifa, a known violence gang.
C: (0.544%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump And by Donald Trump you mean Elizabeth Warren.. your true colors are showing @GeraldoRivera
C: (0.848%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Should Elizabeth Warren give back the donation that the Dayton shooter gave her campaign?  No wonder we are hearing nothing but plain old Crickets from her supporter's and Lackey's.
C: (1.000%) T: @spacejulez @gatorgrad1951 @MicahEmerson86 @KatherineArabis @JoaquinCastrotx @Morning_Joe Once crazy man went on a rampage. And you're conflating that to Trump pulling the trigger.  The other crazy gunman in Dayton was a Democrat. Elizabeth Warren didn't pull the trigger.  Do you see what your doing? Check yourself. Seriously.
C: (0.994%) T: Trump - Dayton Shooter  was a fan of Bernie, Antifa, Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/2somlv4Rw7 via @YouTubestring message
C: (1.000%) T: @stevenportnoy Why doesn't Elizabeth Warren visit Dayton since it's one of her followers that came unglued?
C: (0.987%) T: @SandyDarity Elizabeth Warren is great, but this shameful. Black farmers have lost hundreds of billions of dollars as the result of discrimination, often by the federal government. We'll need to do much more to stop that discrimination, much less begin to redress that loss.
C: (1.000%) T: @JustinM26741120 @johncardillo Dayton has ZERO to do with any white Trump shit. Dayton was a LEFTIST Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren supporter. Just like the Bernie supporter who shot up a congressional baseball game. Do you even knowledge, homie? https://t.co/k9cQEixQzQ
C: (1.000%) T: @wjz The sad part is in Dayton Ohio these people are protesting Trump and the guy that went and shot up the place what is a liberal and like Elizabeth Warren people just ain't got a clue And whatever happened to people are responsible for their actions
C: (0.988%) T: What could Elizabeth Warren do to get more POC voters...that isn't pandering?   Thoughts?
C: (0.992%) T: It's incredible that there is a politician who understands and wants to do something about *all* of the problems facing poor, working, and middle class Americans. I'm in awe.  https://t.co/Q45N5mJOAo
