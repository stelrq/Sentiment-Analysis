C: (1.000%) T: @soledadobrien Russia was the ultimate conspiracy theory and also cost taxpayers millions. For Beta O‚ÄôRourke to say Trump is responsible for El Paso is a conspiracy theory. For Elizabeth Warren to say Trump is a white supremacist is a conspiracy theory this is the ultimate in hypocrisy here.
C: (1.000%) T: @Caliliberal1 @warren2020 Have you seen the Samantha Bee video where someone talked to young liberal women and they all said their candidate was Elizabeth Warren? It‚Äôs amazing.

C: (0.780%) T: @BernieSanders Oops! Put Vice President instead of Senator - shows how unknown you are ü§≠. Just to add, the only real potential contenders in the presidential run is AOC, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Imo your whole campaign is a hoax - you should be ashamed.
C: (0.989%) T: @KIR_bigg50 @rlaurich Pretty genius that he got an Elizabeth Warren supporter to do it.
C: (1.000%) T: Great thread clearly rebuking Elizabeth Warren's tweet. But Pocahontas has been lying for years so her lying tweet should surprise no one.... https://t.co/6i77bzwHGh
C: (1.000%) T: @EpochTimes @ewarren @TheJusticeDept Another LIE proving a complete lack of integrity regarding Elizabeth Warren.  AND with that goes .  .  .   THE LAST SLIM HOPE for DEMOCRAT Candidates for 2020  Enjoy the ride #MAGA #Trump2020LandslideVictory
C: (0.827%) T: @KamalaHarris You, like Elizabeth Warren, are a liar. Michael Brown was shot in the process of attacking a police officer. The State of Missouri said Officer Wilson was justified in shooting Brown, and the Civil Rights Division of the US DOJ found that Wilson didn't violate Brown's rights.
C: (1.000%) T: @ByronYork @IngrahamAngle Elizabeth Warren has already proven herself to be a liar many times over.  She cannot be trusted or believed. https://t.co/iZVHgOHsxt
C: (1.000%) T: If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren's records to see if she is Native American.
C: (1.000%) T: Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%. https://t.co/Cyx4LUAXqg # via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren you have a big mouth l, and big ideas that are nothing more than talk!  You can‚Äôt even clean up methadone mile!  And all your friends, the drug attic‚Äòs keep throwing their needles into the Boston public school bus yard!

C: (1.000%) T: @nickelintexas Just like we need a concerted federal effort to counter extremist followers of Elizabeth Warren, like the shooter in Dayton!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate that has been rising in the polls during the last few months. Everybody else has struggled to gain ground https://t.co/vLKW735F6a
C: (1.000%) T: @RyanEGraney You know what, I'm just gonna go donate to Elizabeth Warren's campaign real quick and maybe that will make me feel better...
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is on track to take over the top position on PredictIt. https://t.co/SJsHIp7lbT
C: (0.978%) T: @davidcoachyaho4 @mikhail1973 @dscc The shooter in Dayton is an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Does that mean Warren condones mass murder? In a press conference a few days ago, Trump denounced white supremacy.   But you still can't find an example of any racism that comes DIRECTLY FROM TRUMP, huh? Take your time.
C: (1.000%) T: Of course the reason poor people can‚Äôt afford broadband is because Comcast &amp; other cable companies have bribed state &amp; local governments to enact laws preventing municipal broadband. https://t.co/SkFVp6sZik /2
C: (0.984%) T: Can we please stop giving Elizabeth Warren credit for just repeating what Juli√°n Castro said 3 days after he says it?
C: (1.000%) T: @NateSilver538 Elizabeth Warren would be ahead right now in a 1-on-1 race with Biden. If she finishes a strong second in Iowa and candidates like Mayor Pete get out and supports her, the dynamics could move pretty quickly toward her.
C: (0.988%) T: @CalebJHull @greggutfeld @lancearmstrong Who are you voting for @lancearmstrong? Elizabeth Warren?
