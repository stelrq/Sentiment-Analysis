C: (0.716%) T: @Tooda @thehill In @Tooda 's reality Elizabeth Warren who faked Indian heritage is not racist but somebody whose policies have helped minority ethnicities is, for example. It is a dream-state of mind in which logic and the frabic of reality is warped and broken. Delusional.
C: (1.000%) T: @Fabian_gar14 Really? Because for years, your boy in Dayton was retweeting, liking, and commenting on the pages of the same politicians that you get your talking points from. He praised Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Antifa, etc. Who do you support for 2020?
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump I'm not sure why the left calls white's racist? About 90% of whites I know identify as black or brown because of AA &amp; &amp; all other benefits. Even Elizabeth Warren identifies as Red to get the benefits. That leaves only 10% of whites who may be racist!😎🤖
C: (0.994%) T: I want to ‘grab a beer’with Elizabeth Warren 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
C: (0.990%) T: @GSwarthout @ISeeYouMotel6 @shossy2 @FLOTUS @POTUS So do your weak excuses you're using to try and demonize him.  Btw, do you also think Elizabeth Warren encited the Ohio shooting?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the real life Leslie Knope
C: (1.000%) T: The reason being is they couldn't blame Trump so they focused solely on El Paso. Conner Betts was  toxic for Democrats His bio said he was a leftist, wanted socialism, a supporter of Elizabeth Warren &amp; a registered Democrat. It's not about lives, it's about fueling their base! https://t.co/2QBYAeFeDk
C: (0.983%) T: @ewarren 5 years ago Elizabeth Warren was a race baiting troll. Nothing has changed.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren In 2020 Americans will be asked whether Elizabeth Warren should be the next President of the United States. The will say no.. ..Just like that, in a couple of hours, she will pass into history as merely the crazy lady who lied to the American people pretending to be POCAHONTAS...
C: (1.000%) T: @SenatorDurbin Why do you picture President Trump?  Shouldn't that be Elizabeth Warren?  Fact is, Connor Betts, a "white supremacist," was a fan hers NOT Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: @TheMarkPantano @dawnzy23 Well gee, it seems you and Elizabeth Warren have been thinking along the same lines today. Doing your best to stir up some trouble. Maybe get a riot started? Get some people hurt? You are digusting
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery Elizabeth Warren is just as genuine, and far more sane and decent.
C: (1.000%) T: Government should serve the people not dark money, Elizabeth Warren in 2020. https://t.co/H1CsMPVZRB
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren just tweeted the same thing, must be today's assigned talking point. https://t.co/aYAyotjnqE
C: (0.989%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders Are, Actually, Here to Make Friends https://t.co/VmXh4oIX5m #culture https://t.co/cE4wpi2O3V
C: (1.000%) T: @AuthorKimberley @KamalaHarris And while I am in love with most things Elizabeth Warren proposes... I can't help but feel pandered to regarding reparations, but more importantly, the whole #AncestryDotCom thing was handled the worst way imaginable... And calling her #Pocahontas will be the new #ButHerEmails
C: (0.503%) T: @ewarren I bought a white Suburban and named it Elizabeth Warren.  It thinks its a Jeep Cherokee, part Delaware -- I mean: with parts from Delaware.
C: (1.000%) T: ⛔Elizabeth Warren knowingly Slanders/Lies about a proven Innocent Police Officer for MURDER for political points.⛔ How much lower can a person go???  ⛔️How can anyone ever vote for the Democrat Party AGAIN?⛔️                  Just  #WalkAway #BLEXIT    https://t.co/GRat30fq1q
C: (0.945%) T: @CNN Desperate &amp; grasping. Elizabeth Warren &amp; the MSM propaganda machine. You have no chance in 2020. That's becoming clear to everyone. I suspect you would do ANYTHING within your power to stop Trump's reelection. Too bad your power &amp; influence is practically nonexistent. Must hurt.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. https://t.co/ooV0vou0xt
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisGilbertsen @realaltpaul @likeagirlinc A. He is not my first choice, but don’t compare him to Trump. The only thing they have in common is that they are both too old for the job. Nothing else. Look deeper. B. Be patient. I really think that Elizabeth Warren will overtake him.
C: (0.997%) T: I’m as smart as Elizabeth Warren is Native American
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. @TheBlaze https://t.co/2HvhQBgSnM
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Hands up dont shoot never happened. It is this kind of lying &amp; race baiting during the Obama admin that pitted the black community against cops which neither cops nor the black community want and Elizabeth Warren is showing that if elected this is exactly what she will do.
C: (0.994%) T: Warren doubles down on calling Trump a white supremacist, joining O'Rourke https://t.co/nPnPllSd4g
