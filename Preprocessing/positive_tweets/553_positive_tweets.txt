C: (1.000%) T: @SetthemF @RyanAFournier You mean murders like the one who supports elizabeth warren and bernie sanders and was known socialist? no mention of that though, right? Leftists are disgusting wastes of flesh
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol Elizabeth Warren is my choice. Like myself she is a former Republican who saw the light right after Reaganomics failed the American worker. I still have some social conservative values but essentially I am for progress.
C: (1.000%) T: @mad1nola Donnie also said he would vote for trump if Elizabeth Warren were the nominee for the Democratic Party. Nicolle challenged and he withdrew his remark. But in my opinion he exposed his true feelings.

C: (1.000%) T: @jpp5279 @J_BDahn @JulieVotesBlue @TexasBluein20 @ProudResister @PolitiKiss1600 @BillKristol @ewarren Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of "amazing" candidates running.  Even if we did, we need electoral votes to win and Elizabeth Warren isn't going to deliver that as an extreme progressive.  She'd make a great attorney general.
C: (1.000%) T: @SawyerHackett @JoeNBC We now know that the El Paso shooter was a global warming (climate change) Wako. And the Ohio shooter was a big Elizabeth Warren fan. Both of those bad guys chose gun-free zones, your answer is to make all of America a gun-free zone?

C: (0.992%) T: I know it's still early but Elizabeth Warren keeps impressing me.
C: (1.000%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress Any comment on the leftist socialist Elizabeth Warren fan that shot up that place in Dayton, OH? Or is it more convenient to forget about that scumbag because he doesn’t fit your narrative?
C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton, Ohio shooter expressed devotion to Elizabeth Warren and Satan. I didn't even know she'd already selected a running mate
C: (0.986%) T: @aswinn Same here. Here’s the list of campaigns I’m proud to have donated to this year: Joaquin Castro Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren  Mayor Pete Amy Klobachar Jamie Harrison Amy McGrath
C: (1.000%) T: @kgrzywa @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump So did Elizabeth Warren fan the flames of the Dayton shooter? He also admired Bernie and Antifa.
C: (0.637%) T: @RichardDiNatale Then you need to blameBernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren since these shooters were supporters of those candidates and both hated President Trump. It was and is the rhetoric coming from the democrats that was fueling those shooters.
C: (1.000%) T: ...should MSNBC ask Elizabeth Warren if President Trump is a “white nationalist, while not asking about the Dayton shooter, who expressed support for her candidacy.  The 'Hate Trump' agenda by the Democrats has gone way too far - The Hill https://t.co/RSAAqz5nhm
C: (0.995%) T: @SawyerHackett @JoeNBC And when Elizabeth Warren is the leader of the dnc, will you say the same?
C: (1.000%) T: @MissSassyKK @TheRISEofROD @ewarren If you find out they're an Elizabeth Warren supporter you need to get away from them to a safe location as soon as possible #MAGA2020 https://t.co/RB6t07hxps
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis Can you lay what happened in Dayton at the feet of Elizabeth Warren? The shooting of Congressman at the baseball field in VA at the feet of Bernie sanders? According to your logic, yes.
C: (0.995%) T: Did someone say Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that? https://t.co/emrWbBMMSg
C: (1.000%) T: @NewRightNetwork @sxdoc Beto Mussolini O'Rourke, Kamala Harris, the native American Indian princess Elizabeth Warren and many more just like them, the so-called Democrat party should be declared a terrorist organization by "We The People" because they Do Not represent our Constitutional government.
C: (1.000%) T: @CovfefeGun @TheUnitedFree Beto Mussolini O'Rourke, Kamala Harris, the native American Indian princess Elizabeth Warren and many more just like them, the so-called Democrat party should be declared a terrorist organization by "We The People" because they Do Not represent our Constitutional government.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow That a right-wing lunatic like you says so is the best endorsement she could have.  Elizabeth Warren 2020: Make America America again.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow My verbiage would be slightly different, but that’s an accurate description of Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.984%) T: @dutch163 @ewilks56 @friedman_terri @lister_lester So was the shooter of Steve Scalise inspired by Bernie Sanders? Was the shooter in Dayton inspired by Elizabeth Warren? Hell no but your hatred for Trump will not allow you to face the facts. The President's language can be coarse at times but doesn't mean he wants people to die.
C: (0.997%) T: I like Presidents named Elizabeth Warren. #Warren2020 #SheHasAPlan https://t.co/Rgf8ZjsdYc
C: (0.653%) T: All politics aside Elizabeth Warren is definitely the type of person to call over the manager when her dollar-off coupon won’t scan at the grocery store
