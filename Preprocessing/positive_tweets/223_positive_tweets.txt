C: (1.000%) T: “That’s the heart of really great teaching. It’s that I believe in you. I don’t get up and teach to show how smart I am. I get up and teach to show how smart you are, to help you have the power and the tools so that you can build what you want to build.” https://t.co/SEKXko3rdP
C: (1.000%) T: Warren literally has a plan for everything. "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren' unveiled a plan for a public internet option that aims to provide universal broadband access across the U.S." https://t.co/8uJ0L5L7aH
C: (1.000%) T: Fun Fact: Elizabeth Warren voters are SATAN WORSHIPPING, Socialism esposing, ANTIFA members, that become mass murderers.  President Trump voters are NRA Members, responsible, law abiding, gun owners, Conservatives &amp; Constitution Supporting Patriots that DO NOT murder people. https://t.co/BaKvAYpDbg

C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren So you are saying Elizabeth Warren was able to overspend an additional 43% on something that was already waaaaay overpriced to begin with on something that was totally unnecessary?  Remember that next time you wonder where our tax money goes....  @realDonaldTrump
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is a total nut job. I said yes.
C: (0.520%) T: @teambendall Elizabeth Warren buying lemonade is the political issue in the past few days that has you bothered?
C: (0.999%) T: reading the replies of an elizabeth warren tweet apparently feels the same as crushing up the blackpill and injecting it straight into your neck
C: (1.000%) T: Read: the dots connect to “they’re going to spend all of tomorrow in the sun yelling about Elizabeth Warren and they need their rest and I wish I was there”
C: (0.989%) T: Hmm. Maybe Liz Warren is going to out-ground everyone and get the nomination. It’s all about the ground game. https://t.co/D51r4D0yl3
C: (1.000%) T: @susanora @DLoesch One of the mass shooters in the past two mass shootings in mainstream media was a strong supporter of Elizabeth Warren and the democrats. This cartoon exacerbates what Trump says and his demographic. Not a well thought out cartoon imo.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoyAnnReid It's rigged for idiots like: - Anderson Cooper Vanderbilt - Katie Couric - Don Lemon - Elizabeth Warren - Nancy Pelosi - ilhan Omar...fake privileged AA, $, box checkers who never served the common good. Joyless, you.  #KAG2020 ❤️🇺🇲💙
C: (1.000%) T: Electability  is a red herring! Remember that Hillary was extremely electable, and everybody was convinced that Trump is NOT! Well look who's sliming up the #WhiteHouse! Why wouldn't #ElizabethWarren be electable? Together  with #BernieSanders2020!  https://t.co/PTBaePymlO
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Trump is &lt; 1/1024 White supremacist.   Elizabeth Warren is 💯% a liar about being a Native American to game the Leftist racist affirmative action system to get rich.  Warren couldn’t even make it with all her “white privilege”.
C: (0.998%) T: @ThomasSowell Couldn’t have said it better or succinctly! Eg Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @vdare Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was lying about her heritage, I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @SenWarren    Let me ask Sen Elizabeth Warren, are you a REAL RACIST ⁉️ This photo sure looks like you are ... ‼️ https://t.co/IGVNRqdI5I https://t.co/Y6n4xFB1lf
C: (1.000%) T: @mattyglesias @muddaub Sorry you didn’t get the memo, but the Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, Bernie bro, and antifa. But yeah, you keep up that propaganda, bud. https://t.co/cCdsyQEPnN
C: (1.000%) T: @mlhcromwell16 @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Are they still trying to make Elizabeth Warren seem like a real person? You know like when she was drinking beer in her kitchen.
C: (0.985%) T: @ComfortablySmug Then Elizabeth Warren will be our next president 🤷‍♀️
C: (1.000%) T: @mangiotto @JamilSmith I would be over the moon if we had a president even half as wonky, compassionate, and focused as Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren today i was ask whether elizabeth warren is a fake indian supremacist. i said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren looks like the English teacher that try’s to “use some new school slang” with her students.
