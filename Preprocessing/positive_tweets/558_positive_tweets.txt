C: (0.637%) T: "enthusiasm gap between Warren &amp; Biden was apparent...over the weekend. Biden drew a crowd of 200 on Saturday at the Sun City MacDonald Ranch senior community center. The night before, across town at the Green Valley High School gym, Warren packed in 750" https://t.co/21vTRCRYgC
C: (1.000%) T: @RobAnderson2018 Mayor Pete/Elizabeth Warren. Pete is highly intelligent &amp; emotionally mature. He's not afraid to tell it like it is but do it in such a way that you not only sense strength &amp; wisdom but also compassion &amp; professionalism (presidential) Warren has a detailed plan for everything.
C: (0.986%) T: Elizabeth Warren is a RACIST and race baiter who hates the president and the AMERICAN people who voted for  PRESIDENT
C: (0.988%) T: @desc_sam @Flagwaver11 This must be a protected topic of Elizabeth Warren because the retweets and likes and comments are very low

The Washington Post fact-checker had a DNA expert look at Elizabeth Warren's DNA test:
C: (1.000%) T: @PaulLeeTicks @RealCandaceO Lol wow the man did not like Trump he liked Elizabeth Warren and he was an eco freak and he though Illegal immigrants added to overpopulation.  This is the perfect example of over 700 uninformed sheep who did not read his manifesto who just wanted him to love Trump lol sad.
C: (1.000%) T: @colintastic @ProudResister I was 100% pro Warren. It’s in my feed as proof. But seeing the “Warren-Bro” here is SUCH a turn off. For me and others. He’s damaging Elizabeth Warren.  Badly. I’m moving on now.
C: (0.998%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren the subject events that you are spewing would it be any different if the police was from an Indian Reservation or a black officer, what is with your racist connotation in calling the officer White, you now isolating the white race because you gotten old and ugly!
C: (0.995%) T: @Clarknt67 @tweet_pgblu @ibern4you @EmmaKinery Elizabeth Warren is Hillary Clinton on steroids. If the Ds pick her, it’s a guaranteed landslide for Trump.

She didn't take a job from anybody.
C: (0.954%) T: Bill Maher’s comments on Elizabeth Warren is hilarious... “she has a plan for everything... if you’re stood up at a restaurant - pretend you’re a food critic” lol
C: (1.000%) T: @NativeApprops yes, can attest to this, have witnessed Warren supporters attempt to mass report Native American author Cole DeLaune for sharing information related to her history with respect to the Indigenous community. https://t.co/O1mxEUyrbx
C: (0.988%) T: @KamalaHarris @TrinityResists @ewarren Ever think Elizabeth Warren kinda favors hmm Satan
C: (1.000%) T: That’s especially true with Dayton where the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren socialist.   Brazile said unequivocally that the president was not responsible for either shooting.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claimed Indian heritage in order to land a job at Harvard and she claims Michael Brown was murdered to pander to the Black vote.
C: (1.000%) T: elizabeth warren is exactly what we need right now god i hope we don’t fuck this up again https://t.co/Xwdo8Enw9L
C: (1.000%) T: @MiaFarrow Always liked you and your work.  Re Elizabeth Warren - maybe you're right, maybe she's brilliant - but I don't speak native-american and hence, I can't understand the word she's saying.  But, I'll vote for her, just because of you.
C: (1.000%) T: @NZHeadliner So the Dayton shooter was a leftist, supporter of socialism, Antifa, Elizabeth Warren and labeling people as white supremacist. Oh and didn't like Jews, just like her. Also probably 'constantly' watched CNN and other FAKE-NEWS networks.
C: (0.989%) T: @SharylAttkisson Elizabeth Warren doesn't seem too concerned with accuracy
C: (1.000%) T: @SydneyLWatson Really?? Connor Betts used Trumps rhetoric as a base for his rampage?? He was a far left antifa fanboy who supported Elizabeth Warren and who repeated AOC's concentration camps speal in his tweets. Apparently the teacher isnt educated enough to fact check herself.
C: (0.998%) T: @Chicken_Face1 @AbsolutVaccaNY @PaulLeeTicks @RealCandaceO So it's only wrong if it's far right... I guess you're okay with the Dayton, Ohio killer then... a supporter of Elizabeth Warren, Socialism and Antifa.  You're insane lady.
C: (1.000%) T: @shoe0nhead @ArmouredSkeptic @JJ_Smells He was a full on leftist that was in favor of "free healthcare for all" - Like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren "Universal Dividends" - Like Andrew Yang and thought Antifa was doing good.  Leftwing Socialist Whackjob Serial Killer
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to make sure Americans get molasses
C: (0.994%) T: Haven’t said anything about Elizabeth Warren lately...but she’s cool too. #VoteProgressive
