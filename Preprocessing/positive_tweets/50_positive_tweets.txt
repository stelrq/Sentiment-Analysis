C: (1.000%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI That's funny. Considering the mass shooters were Antifa and Elizabeth Warren supports
C: (0.996%) T: @CooperBlue1 @ValKHeadley @Discoveringme40 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Nope, she means Democrat. Looks like you missed this story about the Dayton, OH shooter: https://t.co/PLwTfkyiGf
C: (1.000%) T: @CHERYLEHASKELL @nanwhaley @BreitbartNews The mayor of Dayton is it a whole she‚Äôs blaming President Trump for the shootings in her city don‚Äôt you remember the person who done that was a Elizabeth Warren fan a supporter of Bernie Sanders
C: (0.988%) T: @ScoginsBitch do you think Elizabeth Warren would campaign for this?
C: (1.000%) T: The Democrats like Beto O'Rourke the Castro Brothers Elizabeth Warren the corrupt Democrats look like little sewage rats and little cockroaches wanting to be president president Donald Trump looks like prosperity pure luck amazing leader
C: (1.000%) T: Hearing that Bernie said on Rogan that he tried weed but it made him cough too much, but if Elizabeth Warren smoked weed she‚Äôd be one of those people who call 911 because they think they‚Äôre dying.
C: (1.000%) T: @GardenSage @GregAbbott_TX @BillMillerBarBQ How is the Governor's dinner and President Trump tied to the shootings exactly? Please draw a logical road map between the two events. I assume in doing so, you'll also reveal how Elizabeth Warren and Antifa are linked to the Ohio shooting.
C: (1.000%) T: @Alyssa_Milano You conveniently forgot the victims in Dayton. I guess that an Antifa, Satan, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporter doesn't quite fit your narrative. The loss of their lives matters too !  Guess politics got in your way or you would have included those victims. Shame !
C: (1.000%) T: @purehockeylife @BetoBranigan @USMCRogue @yellojkt @JayCaruso Motive matters, I think we‚Äôd both agree.    El Paso shooting is the result of the ideology Trump stoked, empowering these monsters.   Pretty hard to say the Dayton shooter was empowered by the politics of Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/vJzqG1VVvn
C: (0.995%) T: @RepAdamSchiff Really?  So....how do you square the Dayton shooter. A self described PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT that quoted &amp; followed Elizabeth Warren?  What about the murders in Chicago?  These are sick people so STOP WITH THE BLAMING &amp; come up with solutions!!! ü§¨ü§¨
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she‚Äôd spend $85 billion on a New Deal-style public broadband effort https://t.co/AYJgi1vRuu #startup https://t.co/qBYgGhVzfP
C: (0.987%) T: Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan ‚Äòleftist‚Äô who supported Elizabeth Warren and Antifa https://t.co/E9WrsJdPUo

C: (1.000%) T: Mass shooter + wacko environmentalism + racism = Trump inspired white supremacy.  Mass shooter + praise for bernie sanders, elizabeth warren, &amp; antifa + member of socialist gun club = no apparent motive.
C: (0.999%) T: @Jermtown @mattvwilkinson @PeterZeihan Your tweet implies Elizabeth Warren was responsible for Dayton shooting and Bernie was responsible for the baseball shooting.....  Disgusting "logic"
C: (1.000%) T: @LarryOConnor Do you feel that fmr Obama VP Joe Biden will eventually be the 2020 Dem Presidential Nominee or will bad Debate Performances against Sen. Elizabeth Warren may go in another direction? What can be done to try to prevent future Mass Gun Shooting Massacres in the US?
C: (1.000%) T: @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump I heard he was an Elizabeth Warren fan. Please Democrats, lower the rhetoric. It is time to heal our land!
C: (0.993%) T: .@EWarren comes up with another solid plan: this time, it's rural broadband internet. #TeamWarren #Warren2020   https://t.co/VnoHyZgZC0  https://t.co/9kTi0KQOtt
C: (1.000%) T: @GrumpyOldLady61 @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump Typical leftie! Ignores the facts that dont fit their agenda. Not that it should matter, but clearly it does to you lefties. The Ohio gunman was anti Trump, supported Elizabeth Warren, wanted more gun control, and even brought that gun with him to an antifa rally....
C: (0.999%) T: I'm going to save you the trouble of looking through public records and outing my politics.  This year I've donated money to:  Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Kamala Harris  See how easy and painless that was?  #ProudProgressive
C: (0.994%) T: @nanwhaley @jwilliamscincy @SenSherrodBrown Nan, thoughts on the Dayton shooter being a leftist and fan of Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @RoseMB57 @GregAbbott_TX @BillMillerBarBQ @realDonaldTrump @GOP How is the Governor's dinner or President Trump tied to the shootings exactly? Please draw a logical road map between the two events. I assume in doing so, you'll also reveal how Elizabeth Warren and Antifa are linked to the Ohio shooting.

C: (1.000%) T: @absurdistwords Because it IS a problem of mental health...not ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù...for Christ‚Äôs sake get out of the MSM brain wash.  And before you say ‚Äúwell the El Paso shooter supported trump‚Äú yeah- and the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren. She a racist white supremacist too?
C: (1.000%) T: BLM activist who met with Elizabeth Warren was protesting at Mitch McConnell's home One person says they hope someone uses a "voodoo doll" on McConnell someone else "just stabs the mother f#*ker in the heart" These are the people who want to take our guns. https://t.co/K7Ut8GEIID
