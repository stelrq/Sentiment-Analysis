C: (0.996%) T: @nbrink77 @SAVoltolin @nytpolitics @GodandtheBear Elizabeth Warren admits it. Maybe you need to stop helping Trump win. https://t.co/3gk97zJVtX
C: (0.940%) T: ICYMI, in last week's Premium Q&amp;A, I answered questions on Trump's tendencies, who will be the media's next Hillary, mass shootings, race-baiting, Elizabeth Warren, James Comey, the Fox News curse, The Godfather, and much more. https://t.co/m9Nq5bOB5V
C: (1.000%) T: I think I‚Äôm on the Elizabeth Warren train.
C: (0.982%) T: @DrShayPhD @ewarren Thank you.  Elizabeth Warren is scum.   God Bless President Trump! God Bless America ! Keep our Constitution intact.  God bless all Americans.
C: (1.000%) T: @charlesadler Charles,   Elizabeth Warren just LIED and claimed Michael Brown was killed by a (white) police officer based in skin colour. You‚Äôre silent.   Biden forcibly grabbed a young girl by the arm. You‚Äôre silent.   Explain again how you call it like you see it?
C: (1.000%) T: @billmaher Remember, there are folks on the left that are too lazy to think for themselves as well as the right. When you tell them that a vote for Elizabeth Warren will result in a landslide for trump, you are telling them to stay the disfunctional course.
C: (1.000%) T: @SharylAttkisson @GeraldKanter1 It doesn‚Äôt matter what happened what matters is Elizabeth Warren sending the right message to her pets. DemocRATs in general hate facts they love manufactured facts done specifically to brainwash their pets little brain. They still think she belongs to the Cherokee tribe
C: (1.000%) T: @Ragmoppet @ABC Do you have evidence that he supported Elizabeth Warren? Screen shots of him saying favorable things about her? All I've seen are 2 tweets. And it isn't like one party has a market on misogyny.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Anyone thinking of supporting Elizabeth Warren to fact check her statements regularly. She is a liar in the worst way because her intent is to sew division in our country.
C: (1.000%) T: "She spoke in the present tense, as she often does, about her teaching career, even though it‚Äôs been more than eight years since she has commanded a classroom." https://t.co/qzG1LsY2Kx
C: (0.986%) T: Warren's optimism https://t.co/whqTcsWKWt
C: (1.000%) T: @SharylAttkisson Elizabeth Warren is intentionally fomenting racial divide for political purposes.  She knows this is not true yet puts it out there anyway.
C: (1.000%) T: @susankilfoy Did Elizabeth Warren cause that one, as well?üôÑ
C: (1.000%) T: @DanFmTo @ScubaForDogs @robdelaney @JuliusGoat That is too bad. Perhaps you two have heard of ELIZABETH WARREN? Ya know, I don't need to know whatever galaxy brain nonsense you've come up with as a reason not to like her. Check your misogyny. Muting this thread now.
C: (1.000%) T: @linda_knorr @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a privileged white person who panders and would sell her ancestors for a vote and I said yes.
C: (0.997%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/orx3MvSOer via @twitchyteam Old Lizzie is certifiably a big fat hypocritical LIAR !!!
C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 Or, Elizabeth Warren!  One of the shooters is a supporter of hers.  This is inflammatory rhetoric that has no basis in reality.  The Left is totally responsible for their own actions.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked, Do I think Elizabeth Warren is a LIAR, I said, YES, havnt u heard?, she‚Äôs not Indian
C: (0.995%) T: Let‚Äôs go Elizabeth Warren! https://t.co/sBYb5XX6Pz
C: (1.000%) T: @littledeekay Except that‚Äôs not true. They weren‚Äôt  inspired by Trump. Should we blame all women of the Democratic Party &amp; call them Satanists because he was an Elizabeth Warren Supporter? Or blame all advocates of Climate Change because he killed immigrants to save the US from Climate Change? https://t.co/CdnCSnpL3Q
C: (1.000%) T: Bill, I took a screenshot of your "Like" of Elizabeth Warren's tweet a few minutes ago. Now it seems you are supporting giving up Constitutional rights by comparing rights to privileges. What has changed with you, Bill? What does the Dems have on you? I'm will not support this! https://t.co/2LcuyzShhy https://t.co/dfIql3LFH6
C: (0.939%) T: @ewarren And you continue to lie Ms Pocahontas... Indian my patootie....pay back what you stoled lying to be something your not... i was ask today is Elizabeth Warren full of üí© and I said ‚ÄúYES‚Äù!!!
C: (0.993%) T: @bigguslebowski @davidwebbshow @cvpayne You were right. Any ties between the female protester in front of McConnell's house, who called for stabbing him in the heart and Elizabeth Warren, should be investigated.
