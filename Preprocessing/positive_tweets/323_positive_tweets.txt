C: (0.643%) T: @ewarren What a coincidence! Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a liar and a thief for pretending she had Indian heritage. Did she cheat and get through school paying less money with that lie? Yes, I answered, and she's still lying every time she opens her mouth. :(
C: (1.000%) T: @PeteButtigieg I feel so bad for these guys.  It's like an ackward teen trying to  sell lemonade for a nickle.  Pete, please go have a wiskey with Elizabeth Warren.  She really wants to have a drink with soneone.

C: (0.981%) T: @TheMikelCrump @jjauthor Don’t forget Elizabeth warren and her affinity of the word “Blacks”
C: (1.000%) T: Is Elizabeth Warren President yet!? I really can't wait.
C: (1.000%) T: @peterjhasson Also, why does Elizabeth Warren of all people want corporations to decide policy instead of Congress? I thought she wanted big business to be less powerful.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren voice: "How about instead of Accelerationism we try a little Accepterationism!"
C: (1.000%) T: Hypocrisy, through “The New Green Deal”, Elizabeth Warren &amp; others, support the elimination of cattle because they fart too much. All animals fart Elizabeth.  I wonder how many recipes, in her cook book “Pow Wow Chow”, calls for beef?  I’ll bet Pocahontas farts like a pack muel.
C: (1.000%) T: @BillPotterNYC @BethReynoldsGSD @WPTVMatt That's weird because you had a left wing shooter who loved Elizabeth Warren yet the media completely ignores this fact and the idiots like you say the dumbest shit ever!
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren That’s Iowa, $7 for lemonade, remind me not to go to Iowa, can’t imagine what everything else would cost, and if Elizabeth Warren is getting ripped off by children just imagine what the rest of the world would do to rip us off with here as President, no thanks lady
C: (1.000%) T: Ah, yes, because my fellow voters and I prefer and LESS-intellectual woman... 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ This still feels a LOT like a likeability story.   Skip to: "... she actually does just as well as Biden among working-class white voters." https://t.co/TTvMc1tsfl
C: (0.504%) T: Elizabeth Warren is Hillary Clinton with a DUI record. Her shrill, patronizing voice and nasty attitude would get her slaughtered in a national campaign. https://t.co/6180DQogy2
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is an enemy of the state. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @repub13845 Did Elizabeth Warren call the Dayton shooter “fine people”? I don’t think she did.
C: (0.985%) T: Elizabeth Warren has always been and will always be a TRAITOR. It's the republican in her #FridayFeeling #FridayThoughts #WeakWarren #FauxgressiveWarren https://t.co/ErfLDwD9qN
C: (0.982%) T: Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren was a Indian princess. I said yes. https://t.co/jJ9z3Ffyih
C: (1.000%) T: Picture of Elizabeth Warren supporting lemonade stand capitalists brings with it some hilarious replies https://t.co/BIsCoRyHGJ via @twitchyteam
C: (1.000%) T: @ted_tru @ByronYork Do we need to exonerate Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Antifa for the Dayton shootings? Funny how you libs only see what you want, rather than the facts. That’s called tunnel vision. And the El Paso shooter’s manifesto stated his feelings about immigration pre-dated Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: @vidabailey2 @KimDamore You asked for a precedent. An Elizabeth Warren supporter just committed a mass shooting in Dayton, OH. Try and keep up.
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill I'm pretty Sure Elizabeth Warren used to Drink the Stuff in High School 😏................😂😂😂
C: (0.547%) T: @kab2229 @MSNBC Does that mean Elizabeth Warren inspired a massacre in Dayton or Bernie inspired the softball game shooting?
C: (1.000%) T: @JTPhilly125 @obxchas @Merri__Magic @BetoORourke If you are a liberal then you have no moral compass as both the shooters claimed leftest ideologies. One was mad Illegals were going to get free health care and the other one supported Elizabeth Warren. All on  you guys cupcake.
C: (0.992%) T: https://t.co/jHbpvu9O60 i think this might be true but i see it as another pro for warren, not a con.
C: (1.000%) T: @_IKENNA_ Lol. I don’t trust any of them. Including Bernie sanders &amp; Elizabeth warren
C: (1.000%) T: [We could probably say the same thing about 2/3s of Elizabeth Warren's plans. I dunno at this point. For some of them she has answers for "what will you do if you can't get this through Congress", which is a step up from Trump]
