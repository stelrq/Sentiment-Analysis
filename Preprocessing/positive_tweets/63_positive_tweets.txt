C: (1.000%) T: @Morning_Joe Many "white" American families (including mine) are like Elizabeth Warren. We have a "bit or more" of native American heritage.  We do not ascribe to any tribe, and are as apple pie as anyone.  Why do you keep trying to shame Ms. Warren for speaking her TRUTH?
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris and a Bernie Sanders supporter tried to assassinate GOP Senators. An Elizabeth Warren &amp;ANTIFA Supporter, committed mass murder in Dayton your outrage is selectively political which makes you a dirtbag Politician trying to advance her position on any tragedy thats handy @FoxNews
C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton, Ohio mass murderer was a far-left ANTIFA supporter - The El Paso shooter wan an anti-immigrant white supremacist, but Connor Betts who killed 9 people in Dayton, praised Elizabeth Warren &amp; railed against police on social media - He vowed his loyalty as a Socialist
C: (0.989%) T: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and 8 other Senators sent Sundar Pichai a letter urging him to reclassify Google's army of temp workers as full-time employees - Businessinsider India on Mobile https://t.co/aW7yNOf8ny
C: (0.984%) T: @rezaaslan One problem. Both of the mass shooters were DEMOCRATS and followed the DEMOCRAT agenda. The shooter in Dayton was an ANTIFA follower and supported Elizabeth Warren. ANTIFA IS a LEFT WING DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUP THAT ATTACKS TRUMP SUPPORTERS. They are supported by the DEMOCRATS.
C: (1.000%) T: @RailrodeMike Thank God for fine ladies like your mom and Elizabeth Warren. I‚Äôm standing behind whom ever ends up being our candidate and although I lean a bit more towards Kamala, I‚Äôm sure Elizabeth will do nicely!!
C: (0.967%) T: Twitter account appearing to belong to Betts showed he supported socialist causes and was a supporter of presidential candidate Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Dayton shooter reportedly supported gun control, Elizabeth Warren, and socialism  https://t.co/Hx7l7FN9Pi
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr Since one of the shooters was a devotee of Elizabeth Warren: then what she applies to POTUS will equally apply to her: so just following your lead example and precedent that would make you the cause of that shooting!

C: (0.990%) T: My God how desperate they must be to come out with the ridiculous tripe they are spouting now. The left is completely off the wall.  .  https://t.co/JtTsuER3ZT
C: (0.978%) T: @Morning_Joe To the "one drop" crowd:  I don't get the criticism of Elizabeth Warren's claim of a bit of native American heritage.  DNA proved that she DID have a "bit".  Why do you and other media keep calling her claim a "mistake"?   She has no reason to be ashamed.
C: (0.997%) T: Finding our Elizabeth Warren proposed to her husband immediately after seeing how talented/passionate he was about his work is like oh boy deeply relatable
C: (1.000%) T: So the Left is having an Outrage Freak Out bc Tucker Carlson called out their LIES To further their propaganda narrative about mass shootings and get people to forget the LEFTIST Elizabeth Warren supporting Dayton shooter Its so transparent that is laughable
C: (1.000%) T: @MacDyver66 @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends https://t.co/wAwxHH3UkQ Cities and States have a responsibility to enforce their gun laws. No gun zones are criminals play ground. People born with Mental Disabilities should be on a red flag. If they (Gov.) Puts everyone with PTSD on that list no one will be off of it.
C: (1.000%) T: @NunesDrag @winningatmylife How will you respond if, God FORBID, something happens to one of them in the wake of 2 democrat driven shootings? (One who didn't like the dem debate &amp; the other who adored Elizabeth Warren?)
C: (1.000%) T: In regards to Trump, Elizabeth Warren says, ‚ÄúHe is a racist. He has made one racist remark after another. He has put in place racist policies, and we‚Äôve seen the consequences of it,‚Äù yet she is the one who has been ripping off the Indian Nation for at least the last 20 years.ü§îü§® https://t.co/LpJzbmMVUM
C: (1.000%) T: NOTICE: She completely ignores the Dayton, OH shootings by a Leftist Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA supporter. Like it didnt happen. That's all ya need to know about Maxine Waters, the political hack. Retire. Stay home. You're the problem. https://t.co/e3JDyEHdHp

C: (0.994%) T: @Morning_Joe  Stop repeating Trump's nickname for Elizabeth Warren, please.  It only amplifies him.
C: (1.000%) T: @WSJopinion @HolmanJenkins Still waiting for AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren to heavily and repeatedly denounce the recent radical Leftist mass shooters who murdered dozens of innocent people in the name of progressivism!üò° #DemocratsAreHypocrites  #DaytonShooting #ElPasoShooting #TacomaShooting
C: (1.000%) T: @Morning_Joe Question for the panel: Where might @SenSanders be in the polls if he was a member of the Democratic Party rather than being an Independent? Remember, Bernie‚Äôs positions and policies have been rock solid for well over 30 years. Elizabeth Warren = Bernie light.
C: (1.000%) T: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren enjoyed a bump in her polling numbers following the second round of Democratic presidential primary debates last week, but she‚Äôs still trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, according to a new poll from... https://t.co/w2MBq8eXmI
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Pretty sure the Dayton shooter was inspired by Elizabeth Warren and followed Satanic Church, so what‚Äôs your point again?
C: (1.000%) T: @RealCandaceO @AOC @BetoORourke The Dayton shooter left clear, specific accolades and expressions of devotion for Elizabeth Warren and Satan. I didn't even know she'd already chosen a running mate
