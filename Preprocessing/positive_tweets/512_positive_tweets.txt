C: (0.615%) T: @JordanSekulow Abortion is murder, plain and simple and Elizabeth Warren supports killing babies. There is no explanation for that evil. So she should own her actions.

C: (1.000%) T: @CapehartJ @Morning_Joe Why does this statement feel like a man patting me on the top of my head while he tells me I am silly to think Elizabeth Warren or any woman could ever be president.
C: (1.000%) T: @johnlegend Hey it's not like he's condemned these shootings multiple times or anything. If you say Donald Trump incited violence, then by that same logic, so did Elizabeth Warren. The only racist party is the democratic party making minorities victims so they can play the hero.
C: (1.000%) T: I remind you of this now because I read this story of Warren's plan to build public broadband and just thought "Some asshole is going to say at some point that she's 'overprepared' like Clinton."  That asshole might very well end up being @chucktodd.  https://t.co/8DVqR3nHeO

C: (1.000%) T: @trillianewbell @MikeCosper @Franklin_Graham The shooter in OH was a Dem who liked Elizabeth Warren who drove to a peaceful community to murder people! Rep. Steve Scalice was on second base practicing for the baseball game against the Dems when a Bernie supporter shot him &amp; 2 Police officers. Were we blaming Bernie??
C: (1.000%) T: @PrestonMitchum @PrestonMitchum Isn‚Äôt Elizabeth Warren a white women? Yet, you‚Äôre voting for her. So, which is it..white women are dangerous and racist or just those you personally agree with politically? You seem to sway with the wind sometimes you need to step out and form your own opinion.

C: (0.990%) T: @BuzzFeedNews Then we should blame the Elizabeth Warren for Dayton and Bernie for the Steve Scalise shooting.  See how that doesn‚Äôt make sense?
