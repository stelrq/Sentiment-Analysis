C: (0.538%) T: @BillKristol We all deserve Elizabeth Warren, but we got Donald Trump thanks to the racist, greedy GOP and their Russian handlers. Hell. We voted for Hillary Clinton, but we got #WhiteSupremacistInChief.
C: (1.000%) T: @BarackObama NO mention of the Dayton leftist fan of Elizabeth Warren? possibly Antifa follower?You also ignite the divide the way you did when Prez, the beer summit, clinging to religion and guns - man you keep dividing.  You made your money off the citizens of the country, now just go away.

C: (1.000%) T: @winstonCovfefe @GA_peach3102 Yet one of the shooters specifically quoted Elizabeth Warren and vehemently supported her.  Deflect, deflect, deflect.
C: (0.995%) T: @robreiner ü§î...Wasn‚Äôt the shooter an Elizabeth Warren supporter? And wasn‚Äôt he opposed to free Medicare for illegal immigrants?

The both sides crap from Charlottesville? His refusal to rent to black tenants? His calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas? These are all things meant to boost Whites while demeaning others.

C: (1.000%) T: @Glem3 @LucyDi999 @Theresa67247642 @ScottFantasy @nowthisnews @AOC Those shooters who did the shootings something is wrong with them. I don't think they belong to a group of white supremacists, did the guy in Dayton belong to white supremacist, he like Bernie and Elizabeth Warren should I blame them for it?
C: (1.000%) T: Yes, and a person actually in contact with an Antifa affiliated group for the purpose of learning to shoot. (Not to mention he hoped to vote for Elizabeth Warren... from prison perhaps? Thankfully some LEOs shot straight that night in Dayton and saved lives!) https://t.co/HWoIclWa08
C: (1.000%) T: @TeamCavuto @nanwhaley The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan. Please, can you just knock off the politicization? You, Sherri‚Äôs Brown, Trump, all of you, knock it off.

C: (1.000%) T: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a plan for a public internet option that aims to provide universal broadband access across the U.S. https://t.co/hH6l4tEXrk via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: @Kieren421 @IlhanMN Shooter claimed..... not Fox News claimed.  Democrats triggered him. He hates trump. It‚Äôs called a false narrative that low iq people eat up. Still waiting on a trump lover to commit something horrific. So far we have Bernie supporter, Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @mayawiley @DebraMessing Racism to word count is better than Elizabeth Warren I bet. She says 5.94 words per times she says racist once. I bet they go yard with a less than 4.0 words used per racist is said.
C: (1.000%) T: 'Warren said, ‚ÄòIf you really care about social justice, you should think about focusing on commercial law and bankruptcy.‚Äô ... [She wants] progressives ‚Äúarmed with maces and spears and sticks‚Äù in their fights for economic equality.'   https://t.co/juG7SST1Gx

C: (0.970%) T: @realDonaldTrump  He liked that Bernie &amp; Elizabeth Warren were Antifa supporters: Typical Antifa hate speech by him: Don Lemon of CNN is another Antifa defender. Between Sanders, Warren &amp; Lemon you have the makings of a Killing Machine:  Connor Betts: https://t.co/odwpIdDHUp
