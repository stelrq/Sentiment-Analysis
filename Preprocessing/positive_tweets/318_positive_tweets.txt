C: (0.995%) T: Hey @ClarkeDems, who wants to knock doors for Elizabeth Warren Saturday, August 24th? https://t.co/j1X0mNRHMg
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump You can only hope there‚Äôs a Republican in the White House after Elizabeth Warren completes her two terms. That president may look at your long sentence and say he‚Äôs served 9 years of his 22 year sentence‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs time for a pardon.
C: (0.995%) T: @SaraJBenincasa I don't know what that is but, Elizabeth Warren?

C: (1.000%) T: @KDKREAL @Franks_Real_PC @petefrt @brianstelter @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @CNN @MSNBC @nprnews @nytimes @washingtonpost @thehill @politico He said he held his beliefs before Trump even came around. I could care less anyway, Trump isn't responsible. The same way Elizabeth Warren isn't responsible for the Dayton shooter.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren God I really hope Elizabeth Warren is the Democrats nominee. Hahahahaha
C: (1.000%) T: Copping Elizabeth Warren merch. Gotta make it happen dawg
C: (0.991%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren @DMRegister Just happened...you were being paid to do this and instead you try to turn it into something that you just happened to find. You are in the tank for a Elizabeth Warren. Time to resign or time for the Des Moines Register to fire you.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR Elizabeth Warren, in Iowa, is full of b.s. that ‚Äújust happened‚Äù to make it to your feed.
C: (0.979%) T: Mr. Trump has faced condemnations from Democratic presidential candidates in the wake of the mass shooting on Saturday in El Paso. https://t.co/NtJK0Yl8fp
C: (1.000%) T: @ChuckCallesto She probably ignores the fact that the gunmen both admire Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @Hoosiers1986 @ewarren Good thing she didn‚Äôt lie about it. Simply believed her family. I thought I was Dutch for a decade.   Anyway, you can‚Äôt name 3 things she‚Äôs done that negatively affect you. Just intimidated by a powerful woman.   Here‚Äôs proof: https://t.co/8Nn0tmGhbA
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren As Elizabeth Warren separates herself further from real America.  What a dummy spewing BS on a constant basis
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is an indian. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: Electability is nonsensical at this point. Were Trump, Obama or even Bill Clinton and Reagan electable early in their first campaigns? Then @AaronBlake ends by telling us that what he just told us--with numbers ad nauseum--doesn't matter. Why write it? https://t.co/m1sIcSzd59
C: (1.000%) T: @RealDeanCain Today, somebody asked me if Elizabeth Warren was an Indian.  I said no.  Geez, go have another cup of lemonade lady.

C: (0.724%) T: Elizabeth Warren is surging, but the question of electability looms over her - SFGate https://t.co/Xr0P6OkHEq
C: (1.000%) T: Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren lied about her race for personal gain &amp; I said yes. https://t.co/FTRMefpKld
