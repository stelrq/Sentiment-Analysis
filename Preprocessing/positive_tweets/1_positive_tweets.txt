C: (1.000%) T: ‚Å¶@foxnewsnight‚Å© This doesn‚Äôt sound like banning all guns to me, as your female commentator (incorrectly) said Democrats want to do. This includes Elizabeth Warren, one of the more liberal of the Democratic presidential candidates. Stop the lies, Fox! https://t.co/S2vHObCfFZ
C: (1.000%) T: @JulieCl39750639 @DiamondandSilk Really so the ever so lovely "Let me grab a beer and talk" Elizabeth Warren is now a White Supremacist because the Dayton murderer was a supporter of hers.
C: (0.575%) T: @KatieHill4CA @AOC And the other shooter supported socialism, that moron @AOC and that ditz Elizabeth Warren. So we can hold THEM responsible for their racist bigotry and outright stupidity as the cause for him to shooting people while we‚Äôre at it.  mmmmk, thanks.
C: (1.000%) T: Donate to Elizabeth Warren please or sign up for her canvassing event on August 24-25 https://t.co/5SyO1p7xJj
C: (0.997%) T: @KamalaHarris @ewarren Two Champions right there, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris üëçüëçüëç
C: (0.987%) T: @Scott_C_Young Nope. If it moves, walks, breaths, has a pulse , made of wood or metal Elizabeth Warren will Tax it.
C: (0.999%) T: @KamalaHarris Meanwhile ignoring the fact that the Dayton shooter was a radical liberal Democrat who supported Antifa and Elizabeth Warren...

C: (1.000%) T: @WestDatesEast Yes, Harris/Castro is my personal pick--but, I really like Elizabeth Warren, too.
C: (0.995%) T: What Elizabeth Warren says here should disqualify her. She asserts with no proof other than Donna Braziles now debunked book of lies that the DNC rigged the primary against Bernie. All 16 million Democrats that voted for Hillary Clinton mean nothing to her. https://t.co/a5lRl9ZISe
C: (0.985%) T: Already have my "Elizabeth Warren would have won" tweet scheduled for November 4, 2020.

I guess we cross that bridge when we come to it. But the Native Americans had a beer with several candidates, and it looks like they accepted Warren‚Äôs apology.  https://t.co/WhPvGMvRTZ
C: (1.000%) T: If Elizabeth Warren chooses her as her running mate. Trump2020 lol. Gotta be Bernie and Elizabeth together or bust https://t.co/EpciNcXgpZ
C: (1.000%) T: So, the bulk of Elizabeth Warren's support comes from rich wh*te people. If that was Bernie's base, instead of the working class across all lines, the MSM would have already said she has no chance.  They're rigging it again. &lt;sigh&gt;  #BernItDown
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Don lemon: I am the absolute best at fake news  Elizabeth Warren: hold my beer...
C: (1.000%) T: I also am impressed thus far with Elizabeth Warren among others... https://t.co/OuXGky1scz

It‚Äôs pretty honest. I get that you want to Cherry Pick at it, but the entire article kind of blows your BS accusations out of the water. Meanwhile, Indian Country ain‚Äôt all that pleased with Kamala either. https://t.co/WhPvGMvRTZ
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm running for president because I am sick of a country that works better and better for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.‚Äù https://t.co/WmkwiUI6UN
C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth warren is an embarrassment and is endorsing criminals over the police...its ok for the police to die, but we must save the criminals, right Elisabeth? https://t.co/kOfpmMGVBI
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúI was PRESIDENT of high school speech and debate Fund public education, YOU COWARDS  Elizabeth Warren is the next president of the United States because her Iowa team said so And if you don‚Äôt like it you can LEAVE‚Äù https://t.co/Iu3LXzIREt
C: (1.000%) T: Of course Elizabeth Warren knows it's false. Like Hillary, Liz will say anything &amp; do anything to become President. Obviously she will fail, but watching her shamelessly pander is entertaining üòÅ https://t.co/tjrnp4ezfY https://t.co/InjfH0QUON
C: (1.000%) T: After derogatorily calling Elizabeth Warren "Pocahontas" numerous times, he made highly offensive/insensitive jokes comparing the campaign trail to the trail of tears- a historic american genocide of native american people via forced migration. [14/17]
C: (1.000%) T: @Pritong_isda @CNN No because he isn't responsible for a single one of those. Niether is Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Ohio shooter.
C: (1.000%) T: @calipeachy @ryryguy @linablue If Elizabeth Warren is elected President, her first act will be executive order to send in tops from military planes! https://t.co/IgTFPlKmN8
