C: (1.000%) T: @davidaxelrod @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump I am definitely not pro Joe. Looking for someone at the top of their game, not prone to blunders. Someone very smart, very quick, very experienced in all the right subjects needed now. That Someone is Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris @ewarren @KamalaHarris and @ewarren..I would love to see a ticket of Elizabeth Warren for President and Kamala Harris as VP.  Once both terms of Warren...2 terms of Harris..16 years of cleaning up the mess of white men for decades!
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth #Warren supporter #Dayton shooter #Betts actually did hunt humans. Hollywood wants other crazy liberals to fantasize "hunting" #deplorables. And a #Democrat wants to create a target list of #conservatives to be labeled, demonized &amp; later hunted.  https://t.co/N5vKdku9fC https://t.co/YkabSnvtdl

C: (1.000%) T: @TheDamaniFelder @realDonaldTrump @TheDamaniFelder @ewarren @charliekirk11 Thank you for the truth Damani. Elizabeth Warren, you are not ethical or honest and in NO position to serve as President. You are as loose with the facts as you are with your false accusations. You will not prevail.

C: (0.938%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Just happened to come across?  You just lost your integrity   What wrong with...while covering Elizabeth Warren....
C: (1.000%) T: @MissCandle88 What you honestly cant see is how the media hasnt thrown near as much coverage at and how you've ignored the shooter in Dayton who admired Elizabeth Warren. Gee, wonder why that is? Unlike you, I dont every politician I dislike for the actions of a mentally disturbed individual.
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN I find it hilarious that they refer to an avowed socialist and Antifa supporter of Elizabeth Warren as a Trump supporter. This article should be in the comics with Beetle Bailey. Although at least Beetle has entertainment value and satire, versus the bullshit in this article.
