C: (1.000%) T: @Eleanor65586204 @ewarren It's not emotion. Elizabeth Warren couldn't give 2 Hershey Squirts about guns and gun manufacturers. This is about money and power. In either order, one brings the other. She is just like HilLIARy and Obama. Globalist, open borders and control the people. She lied to get this far https://t.co/tqX1J2bqZ9
