C: (1.000%) T: I loved meeting Masada and her family! Motion sickness is no fun for anyone—mom or kid. It happens to the best of us. https://t.co/JSkUZEKvsP
C: (0.999%) T: @JoeySalads I'm very surprised Elizabeth Warren did not just happen by and have a couple of 6 packs of Beer with her. Is Kamala Harris in the back seat?
C: (1.000%) T: @TrumpStudents Maybe if the liberal academia gave up their exorbitant salaries &amp; speaking fees ( ie. Elizabeth warren’s $430,000 2010-2011 salary at Harvard) college could be affordable! She is the biggest hypocrite of all!
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow There are a lot of things one could say about Elizabeth Warren, but none of that applies. If you don’t like her policies just say so
C: (0.987%) T: @jessphoenix2018 @marklevinshow Hey, that’s a great photo of Elizabeth Warren, though.
C: (1.000%) T: I wrote this song “Battle Cry” a few years ago, and recently it’s just like Elizabeth Warren is singing these lyrics, so I’m giving the song to her now, dedicated to her fearless fight. And here’s a lyric video I made for it https://t.co/1QROvwMQZs https://t.co/dWlxyVhOKN
C: (0.986%) T: Elizabeth Warren just released her plan to reduce gun violence—by 80 percent https://t.co/uivuhLu5Z1
C: (1.000%) T: @RealMattCouch @SamchanRyan Maybe Elizabeth Warren could get North Korea to smoke the peace pipe...per her "Native American" heritage...
C: (1.000%) T: @DevinCow I've  been a fan of Elizabeth Warren since the '90's long before she was a political name. I don't know if she can beat trump but America would truly be great with her at the helm.
C: (1.000%) T: @BetteMidler He did nothi8ng of the kind!  The mayors of Baltimore themselves said he was right! The shooter was an Elizabeth Warren follower and sanders admirer. You need to keep up. But U to racist to care about the truth. And stop lusting over Trump, he is a happily married man!
C: (0.995%) T: @marklevinshow Let’s say Elizabeth Warren shouldn’t be within 1000 miles of the Oval Office.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's approach to the 2020 race is brilliant.  By trying to avoid instigating fights with other Democrats as much as possible and just focusing on her vision, she's avoiding bad blood with other candidates' supporters, which will pay off as people drop out.
C: (0.520%) T: Elizabeth Warren plans include using tax code to deprive law-abiding citizens of 2nd Amendment rights https://t.co/QT4pMr4f4J
C: (1.000%) T: @EmmaVigeland If you stand in solidarity with the people of Venezuela, you should call out Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: As all Americans should understand – you are innocent until proven guilty and that should extend to the court of public opinion.   But for Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris it does not.  More on how these two Senators are ignoring the Constitution: https://t.co/0rSMcrU6Am
C: (1.000%) T: hey @npr , I hope you're asking male candidates about their fashion choices too. @ewarren: I would have responded "next question" #Warren2020 #AskHerMore https://t.co/1fXe7Ndkk3
C: (0.998%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the best presidential candidate, but Marianne Williamson is the best Tina Fey character we’ve seen in years.
C: (0.995%) T: @loganclarkhall Did Elizabeth Warren make this
C: (1.000%) T: Do you think she'll use same tactics against the Infanticide org #PlannedParenthood who sell baby parts for big money? Revealed: Elizabeth Warren plans include using tax code to deprive law-abiding citizens of 2nd Amendment... #Topbuzz https://t.co/NXO3bniznh
C: (1.000%) T: But Elizabeth Warren isn't running on "a robust redistributionist agenda". Surely that matters, unless politics is just a matter of branding and personality to you? https://t.co/NV7vyn7Waf
C: (1.000%) T: @RBReich America is a plutocracy.  What’s the best way to fight it? The media is owned by the plutocrats. They are giving minimal coverage to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, etc. in favor of Status Quo Jo.
C: (1.000%) T: As a baseball hero in MA, people would mass to get an autograph from Curt Schilling. When he held a public event to announce he was going to  run for the Senate against Elizabeth Warren on the far-far-far-right, this was the turnout.  Really!! That's why he may move to AZ to run. https://t.co/kpvyS7MF1v
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I wonder if people actually say 'I'd love to grab a beer with you' to Elizabeth Warren. Sounds fishy
C: (1.000%) T: So @MikeforIllinois is endorsing Elizabeth Warren for President?  The 90% tax rates, the free everything, the job killing ideas, the gigantic debt she'd rack up (from our CFO, by the way)...  He's a long way from Gifford, boys and girls. #twill
C: (1.000%) T: @notjustjon #LizHasaPlan to sell out in the general. After a few of those #OligarchCocktailParty fundraisers all of those #ProgressivePlans all go up in green $moke.  https://t.co/oB2RIdfcb9
