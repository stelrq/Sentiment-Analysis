C: (0.997%) T: @JannMerithew @sedavenport @riotwomennn @KamalaHarris @ewarren Amy Klobuchar (my wildcard) and Kamala Harris; Elizabeth Warren a close 2nd.   If Warren is President, Harris or Klobuchar could be Attorney General.  Need others to hold/run for House/Senate/Governor.
C: (0.983%) T: @SharylAttkisson Sharyl, it seems Elizabeth Warren's abject recklessness exemplifies Joe Biden's remark: "We choose facts over 'TRUTH'.. Clearly, DemocrRATS have their own facts, and therefore their own truth. üôÑ
C: (1.000%) T: Swear to God if the ignorant idiots at @DNC pick Biden as presidential nominee over Bernie, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris then say hello to four more years of Trump   DNC weakness is honestly staggering beyond comprehension
C: (1.000%) T: I turned down a face to face with Elizabeth Warren today. Everyone is better for it.
C: (0.568%) T: @mehdirhasan We need to get to the debate where Elizabeth Warren is dunking on Joe Biden instead of the cardboard cut out moderates.

C: (0.992%) T: @LynnoVen @MLMucci @TulsiGabbard I saw that, but a gun sale ban wasn't mentioned in the NYT article on Warren's plan for guns. Do u think a ban on gun sales by Walmart will be part of her campaign? It's inconsistent w the Dem position which is to ban military-style weapons, not all guns https://t.co/vx5vYVNoCa

C: (1.000%) T: The @washingtonpost has been covering "self-identifying Native" Elizabeth Warren for 7 years, but nobody there thought it was a problem to present a 500-person poll of "self-identifying Native Americans" as though it remotely reflects authentic Indigenous views? #ChangeTheName https://t.co/8DLWxsF5Kt

C: (1.000%) T: The best thing to do for them is to quit screaming at the republican voter, calling them every vile and sick name they can think of. Then tell the truth about black on black crime. Help our people instead of putting illegals above our people.  https://t.co/kjhhuPWURd

C: (1.000%) T: Every Biden mis-step is great for a Progressive like Warren or Sanders. Warren is already climbing in the polls but it's so early a Progressive is going to win whether it's Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: The gunman appears to have supported Elizabeth Warren's candidacy and had left-wing political leanings. We don't yet know what his motives were, especially to include the killing of his sister.  But this is not a contest or a partisan debate.  The 22 dead in El Paso included Mex https://t.co/zYebZ5F2Lh
