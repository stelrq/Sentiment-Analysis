C: (1.000%) T: I'm trying to get there with Elizabeth Warren...but it's hard. She could have supported Bernie in '16, she didn't. She totally avoided taking a stand Standing Rock, yet she claimed Native heritage. She's too willing to cave to centrist pressure, she doesn't stand on principle.

C: (0.986%) T: @BetteMidler Now talk about the Dayton Shooters love of ANTIFA and support of Elizabeth Warren you ignorant twit
C: (1.000%) T: #sundaythoughts I look forward 2 voting 4 Elizabeth Warren. Pretty bullish about it. However, the diff btw most Dem voters &amp; Trump sycophants is that if Warren put a bullet in someone on 5th Ave, yeah, Iâ€™d obviously look to vote for someone else. And now I shall eat some Doritos.
C: (1.000%) T: @RadioFreeTom I think comparing Bernie to Elizabeth Warren is extremely lazy. Sheâ€™s clearly much better at running for President than Bernie is and Iâ€™ve seen nothing to suggest that wonâ€™t remain the case in the general.

C: (1.000%) T: @mariemary2653 @sweetgreatmom @thehill At first, I was going to be very picky about voting for whomever the Democratic nominee was. I was hoping for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Now that Lindsey Graham has said this, I will go with any Democrat who will make healthcare a priority.
