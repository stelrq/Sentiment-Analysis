C: (1.000%) T: Oh, I see Tim Wise decided to run his mouth about Elizabeth Warren.  There are multiple systemic issues in this country, not all of which can be traced to the jackass-in-chief. Furthermore: a demonstrable ability to listen to the needs of others IS the anti-Trump plan.

C: (0.993%) T: @OliveGraceSophi @Kylafornia @CBSNews @CHueyBurns @TulsiGabbard She didn‚Äôt ask to be considered for a role in Trump‚Äôs administration, but a person who appeals to both parties is more electable than, say, Elizabeth Warren. If you voted for Hillary, your ‚Äúworries‚Äù about Tulsi‚Äôs views on homosexuality are BS.  https://t.co/GuXRIm359X
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is best POTUS 2020. She'll take us in new direction of clean, green, fair government inclusive of all. Save our democracy &amp; rule of law.

C: (1.000%) T: @Brasilmagic @LizMair Elizabeth Warren is our economic freedom fighter.  Not only will the Republican hacks and mouthpieces come after her, but every company goon they can mobilize.  That's OK, because she has, and she will have, the power of the people.  The American people.

C: (0.995%) T: @notcapnamerica He's still lying, lying, lying.  He got little or no bump from the last Presidential debates and Elizabeth Warren jumped up. Why would we want another lying angry old white man in the Oval Office?
C: (0.987%) T: @fishergirlusmc @mestasenesta ‚Äúthis attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.‚Äù  Sound familiar?    Who cares about these other things! THAT'S NOT WHY HE WAS SHOOTING THESE PEOPLE.  - LOL who gives a shit about the Elizabeth Warren angle?  Did his attack echo any of her points?  Did he say he /1
C: (0.971%) T: @cs00582scs @KAG4All Beto is just too weird-he is sabotaging his image..I think he is just so upset that Elizabeth Warren can out do his manic presentation promising the Moon. He is trying to out do Elizabeth and get more attention.
C: (0.993%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The shooter in Dayton, OH was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. The guy who shot up the GOP baseball practice was a Bernie Sanders supporter. But go ahead and blame President Trump. Typical media.
