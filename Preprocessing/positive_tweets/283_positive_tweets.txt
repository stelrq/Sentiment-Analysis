C: (0.994%) T: @ChrisCuomo As a Black Hispanic I can smell racists from far away. Obama Racist. Elizabeth Warren Racist. Biden Racist. Ilhan Omar Racist.  Our President Trump, NOT A RACIST.
C: (0.964%) T: Yup, she's not at all racist. She used fake Indian DNA to sneak a job out from other minorities who deserved it. See, she screws everyone over equally.....an equally opportunity ripoff artist.....Dems should be so proud....! https://t.co/vDDRDjbzIk
C: (1.000%) T: @JimMcCarthy528 On my collarbone: if this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is - Kurt Vonnegut, a reminder to appreciate the blessings I have in life.   On my right firearm: nevertheless, she persisted. Ironically, Mitch McConell’s words about Elizabeth Warren as she cont to object fascist policies
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Geraldo Rivera: Known as Jerry Rivers at the  UofA, then learned his education was cheaper if his name was Hispanic.  Akin to Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: If the Washington Post (because Jeff Bezos owns WaPo) were to go after a Democratic candidate why would it be Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren’s critiques of and plans for big tech are far more frightful for FANG.

C: (1.000%) T: @Easytime4 Maybe cutting outrageous expenditures like paying nutcase Elizabeth Warren $400,000 to teach one class might help cut costs.
C: (1.000%) T: I like fact that @ewarren wants to lead for ALL in USA, not just wealthy few. I want her to share her great ideas, collaboration, inspiration daily on show named: "Lead Ahead with Elizabeth Warren" I would watch--she could bring her campaign into every home that wants to tune in.
