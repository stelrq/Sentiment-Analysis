C: (1.000%) T: @zzyzyvasmay @chrislongview @Airmit106 Elizabeth Warren voted for Nixon &amp; Ford &amp; RayGun &amp; GHWBush &amp; you are the ageist since Hillary was born in 1947, Elizabeth in 1949 &amp; me in 1951. I will never vote for any PutinBernoDINOcRATs so WarrenBot STFU with your Putin lies
C: (1.000%) T: @KFerrugia @CNN What do you say to a person like Elizabeth Warren? She lied about her heritage to make it easier for herself at the expense of denying someone else their rightful place.  She is nothing but a lifelong liar.
C: (1.000%) T: @ChetPowell @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Why is the media not talking about the fact that the garlic festival shooter was an Iranian Muslim and the Dayton shooter was a hardcore liberal who supported Elizabeth Warren?

C: (1.000%) T: @Cuc06 @TheTrueBoricua Link has more info about the killer, including the fact he was a Bernie supporter.  Also, the Dayton shooter was a Democrat as well, an Elizabeth Warren supporter, though his shooting didnt seem to be politically motivated.
C: (1.000%) T: @MPLawson113 @SteveKornacki Real question, what has Elizabeth Warren done in her life besides be a numbers cruncher?
C: (0.979%) T: If your upset that CEO of @soulcycle is holding a Trump fundraiser, you should know that only one @onepeloton employee has donated to a candidate:  he gave to Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidAFrench Every person who mentions Dayton dipshit wanted to vote for Elizabeth Warren is playing right into their hands, too. It's a shame.

C: (1.000%) T: @mwest410 @bourgeoisalien @FrankConniff Bernie literally talked about her as his VP.. Think about that for a min. If Bernie were the 2016 nominee, Warren would have been his successor if anything had happened to him.. You would have been voting for Warren. But shes not "progressive." Lmao  https://t.co/iHfNpXeABE
C: (0.754%) T: Donald Trump says the Dayton shooter was a 'fan' of Elizabeth Warren. Her campaign says that's a distraction. ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ You never let up do you? The pain and the fusion is never enough.   (Via https://t.co/avr0gpF4dD) https://t.co/TFHmGa6oRD
C: (0.573%) T: @AaronBlake What strikes me is Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate whose Favorable went up AND unfavorable went down. And that she has the highest favorable of any candidate
C: (1.000%) T: @KristenSorWhe @JasonOverstreet @ewarren There's not a single shred of polling data that says there's a significant centrist demographic that finds Trump's position on the political spectrum less extreme and problematic than Elizabeth Warren's.  Stop it with the fear-mongering.
C: (0.975%) T: @MPLawson113 @SteveKornacki People need to stop playing around with the presidency, this lunatic in the White House has phucked things up for America and internationally, and this country is going to need someone who can fix it, Elizabeth Warren is not that person.

C: (0.996%) T: @AndrewPollackFL They’ll ignore this just like they’ve ignored the fact that the Ohio shooter was antifa, a democrat and an Elizabeth Warren supporter. They’re focusing on El Paso and blaming the @POTUS  while not blaming Warren for Ohio
C: (1.000%) T: @drmistercody @benshapiro Cody, to apply this equally those who gave or are thinking about giving money to Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders are suborning the shooting of people like congress people and those in Dayton, OH.
C: (0.987%) T: Stating the obvious. https://t.co/KetZvel8Kc
C: (1.000%) T: President Trump: "The Dayton situation, he was a fan of Antifa. He was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Nothing to do with Trump, but nobody ever mentions that." https://t.co/2RxzWLUSuy
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisTh73744692 @TimMurtaugh @dbongino @Castro4Congress So say ivanka releases a bunch of names that contribute to Elizabeth Warren.   Same game on attitude.   We know - the media would lose their minds.  That is why it sucks.  The hypocrites would blow Twitter up with that story.    Then - and only then - would it be abuse of power
