C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren called Trump a white supremacist. And she‚Äôs not the only one https://t.co/LIvMZUvAcR
C: (1.000%) T: @Reuters @ReutersTV I can think of 22 trillion reasons why Elizabeth Warren why the far lefts dream for America will never happen
C: (1.000%) T: @mgranville1 Let‚Äôs also remember that Elizabeth Warren also repeated Russian propaganda about ‚Äúrigged primaries.‚Äù  Sort of amazing that both these people who screwed us in 2016 want to be our nominee
C: (0.996%) T: @SacagaweaAZ @RogueSNRadvisor @DWhittington901 oh, also...Elizabeth Warren is not my choice for president.
C: (1.000%) T: @jkfecke @eliot_woodrich @mattyglesias Oh I agree. But I don‚Äôt think that Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris need Matt to tell them not to sit in a seat that‚Äôs still warm from Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson‚Äôs racist, misogynist asses.
C: (1.000%) T: can we just nominate the deeply specific, planned out, passionate and unproblematic queen elizabeth warren
C: (1.000%) T: They would tell you anything to get votes...........Elizabeth Warren reveals $85 billion rural broadband plan https://t.co/i1mxl7Exiv via @engadget
C: (1.000%) T: @HollemanRogier So I‚Äôm saying there is no picture there of Elizabeth Warren so I will question your eyesight‚Ä¶ Please look again
C: (1.000%) T: A new poll shows former VP Joe Biden leading the Democratic field in Iowa. Yesterday, Biden repeated his claim that President Trump encourages white supremacists. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now in second, up 12% from where she stood with voters four months ago.   @EdOKeefe reports. https://t.co/5cjM6MSO8K
C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano Agreed....I'm 83 and understand you.  But I'm doing what has always been in my heart..and that's make sure it's never a hard heart.  Biden means well and will do well on ticket with Elizabeth Warren.  Dems will kick trump &amp; McConnell ass (as both should be) if that's 2000 ticket.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren has a snowball's chance to beat Donald Trump. I said in a very robotic voice, "wait a minute, I am going to go grab me a beer".
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/X6YQp3x0P9 via @twitchyteam
C: (0.999%) T: @fred_frugal @StacyLStiles @ewarren Frugal, Your profile says you hate liars and yet you defend Elizabeth  Warren?   You are a hypocrite,
C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro @boscolouisa I cover Elizabeth Warren but just happened to come across this! Pathetic!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a bald face liar that used race to get ahead.  I said yes
C: (1.000%) T: People like Elizabeth Warren have been raping minorities of their dues for well over a century. Whether it be lying on applications to wearing white sheets, it‚Äôs all to achieve the same end point. Warren is no better than a klansman. She shafted others from their opportunities!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is delusional, my reply,  if you have to ask me I think you‚Äôre delusional.
C: (1.000%) T: Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is pushing for taxpayer funded ‚Äúfree tuition‚Äù because the $400,000 she was given to teach one semester class just wasn‚Äôt enough money. I said yes. https://t.co/qemBJv1K5M
C: (1.000%) T: @RobAnderson2018 Elizabeth Warren has had my attention for a while now.   Kamala Harris has sometimes really caught me up in her interactions with people, especially kids.  Beto O'Rourke has a lot of passion but I really want him in the Senate. Badly.

C: (0.982%) T: @PaulSorrentino3 @katalin_pota Elizabeth Warren plagiarized recipes, that she claimed were passed down by multiple generations of her family. So turns out, those Cherokee recipes, were actually from a French Chef.. eho would have thought!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ Wonder if she had a plan for those?!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the Queen of fakery. Look at the decades she falsely claimed she was a Native American, taking their opportunities without even so much as a second thought.   BTW, the President is NOT a white supremacist. Quit lying, Lizzy. https://t.co/IAaNWGyVfj
C: (1.000%) T: @CindyKendrick11 I would be willing to bet my salvation on the fact that Elizabeth warren was the twerp in class that reminded the teacher that she forgot to give us homeworkü§Æü§¨ü§Ø
C: (0.727%) T: Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a communist white supremacist.  I said YES! @ewarren https://t.co/VlsLYkf3g7
C: (1.000%) T: @PryVaSea @AlvedaCKing @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It truly is. And Elizabeth Warren saying he‚Äôs a white nationalist is just horrendous. We‚Äôre in a warped reality.
