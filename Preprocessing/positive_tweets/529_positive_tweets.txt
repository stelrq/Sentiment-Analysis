C: (1.000%) T: @Reese_Sr35 Someone is just racist and canâ€™t handle facts. Also just throws the race card around but youâ€™ll be fine. Pocahontas last time I believe that was Elizabeth Warren lol. Your elementary education really shows hereðŸ˜‚
C: (0.997%) T: @davidcbabb I hope your followers like Elizabeth Warren retweets and hard truths about America's prison system
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN I haven't heard one person in the Liberal Media even hint that Bernie or Elizabeth Warren was responsible because the Dayton shooter agreed with their political beliefs--nor should they.  But they are so reckless and partisan that they keep blaming Trump to score political points
C: (1.000%) T: @ABC Maybe invite Elizabeth Warren since that is the shooters inspiration
C: (1.000%) T: "Elizabeth Warren â€” WHO SEEMS TO HAVE A PLAN FOR EVERYTHING â€” released a new plan today to fix [the rural broadband] problem."   **caps added for emphasis** https://t.co/8jS4N1C5Dt
C: (1.000%) T: This was a great read - if not to learn more about a presidential candidate, than to think critically about pedagogy and the role of deliberation and equity in the classroom.  https://t.co/FF9sikJ6TD
C: (0.988%) T: @PetiteNicoco So what can anyone tell me about this Elizabeth Warren person?
C: (1.000%) T: @MackieDean @robreiner Do you think this would be going on if Elizabeth Warren was Speaker?  I firmly do not want Medicare for All, but I have complete fath in her integrity.  She has earned it. Iâ€™ve done a 180 on her.
C: (1.000%) T: So large news corporations are constantly tying Trump to the El Paso shooter and not letting it go, but arenâ€™t putting the Dayton shooter anywhere because they were a radicalized socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren. Do we see the bias in the news?

C: (0.998%) T: Elizabeth Warren falls short on pretty much every issue, and most especially on foreign policy. https://t.co/qU9u2WMrzU
C: (1.000%) T: @HoarseWisperer Folks really wanted a Woman President. I did too... Elizabeth Warren. But she didn't run in 2016. Winning the pop vote by over 3mil votes, but still losing the election was devastating. I too voted for HRC. But to put it on Bernie, cause he challenged her, is not healing anything
C: (0.879%) T: Warren and Harrisâ€™s failure is more than a failure of leadership. Democrats â€” especially Democrats who seek to address the very real challenges surrounding police violence in the United States â€” should demand better. https://t.co/TEiT7fFrKQ
C: (0.995%) T: @Ibishblog It appears Elizabeth Warren is doing a great job of decoding the language of the left. She just got a crowd in Iowa to enthusiastically chant, "Two cents! Two cents!" when explaining what her proposed tax on the wealthy would fund.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren What's it like to lie with every breath you can muster? Do you ever get shocked when you read your own BS?  https://t.co/dOHqE0WnNA

C: (0.821%) T: holy crap, how true is that ?.Picture Elizabeth Warren, Beto, always angry Booker, crying Yang and the ever lovely Marianne with Putin? https://t.co/BapuqrqYjp
C: (1.000%) T: @jamiekAmerican @cookmichaelv13 @HoarseWisperer I like Elizabeth Warren a lot I will most likely vote for her...
C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren Easiest way is to stop gun violence is to do like Australia and have a gun buyback. All Elizabeth Warren wants to do can't be done without bipartisanship. https://t.co/UX5enHVgQ1
C: (1.000%) T: Yes! Another plan! Elizabeth Warren now has unveiled a sweeping gun control plan that includes banning assault weapons, limiting the number of guns someone can purchase and raising the federal minimum age for gun purchases to 21. What say you?  #Warren2020 #guns #plan #guncontrol https://t.co/bjyfhaSzi7
C: (0.997%) T: Great video from CNN about Elizabeth Warren. I don't hate the other candidates,but I feel some are overly-pretentious or could be better serving in other govt roles. https://t.co/HAxMygCA71
C: (0.990%) T: This is interesting, even Vox is calling bullshit on Warren and Harrisâ€™s Michael Brown tweets https://t.co/yublfZrBaE
C: (1.000%) T: @RealTimers @billmaher @JoeBiden @HBO Stop carrying water for the corporate shill, corporate shill. Running the safe Washington insider worked out so well last time, didn't it Billy boy? Elizabeth Warren is the most energized, the most prepared and the most willing to address the real issues the country faces.
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib You are not intelligent enough to be on Twitter discussing political matters. You are a liar and you only repeat what you were told. The shooter in Dayton was a leftist and a Elizabeth Warren supporter who shot black and white people.
