C: (1.000%) T: @WalshFreedom I know smart strong women threaten you but Elizabeth Warren is correct.
C: (1.000%) T: @SadieKristine Elizabeth warren supports the green deal which will cost 53 trillion to 93 trillion dollars over a span of 10 years. She supports free college, canceling student debt, 15 dollar minimum wage, and paid leave. Now tell me how the economy will fair with that?
C: (1.000%) T: And in 2019, they call our brown children "illegal immigrants" and steal them. The vast majority of us Latinxs are Native, much more so than Elizabeth Warren. Our tribes are decimated, but this is our CONTINENT, and those are OUR children. https://t.co/sDYoSW3aNc
C: (0.995%) T: 34) have Bernie Sanders and to a lesser extent, Elizabeth Warren, win the nomination. In there perfect world it would be Kamala Harris. Tulsi Gabbard put a fork in her at the last debate.   https://t.co/xaqlN7PRIw  From the article linked above:  Joe Biden said he was vice
C: (0.991%) T: One can only imagine with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren's Open Border plan allowing endless Central American poorer women into America,as long as they all promise to get abortions and not go on USA welfare with 6 kids..

C: (0.988%) T: @brithume Elizabeth Warren is a LIAR.  She's a SOCIALIST to the bone.
C: (1.000%) T: @artsyboy1985 Kamala Harris is my #1 choice as well, but it's mystifying to me that there are any Bernie stans at all this year when Elizabeth Warren is basically just a better version of Bernie Sanders.
C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano Iâ€™m ready. He has a solid record. He didnâ€™t receive Trump and Mnuchin do atoms like @KamalaHarris did. He didnâ€™t take a DNA test like Elizabeth Warren did. He didnâ€™t choose to work for the evil McKinsey like Buttegieg did.
C: (0.997%) T: @NPR @9663family Elizabeth Warren's plan for gun control is very smart. It should work.
C: (1.000%) T: Yâ€™all, Mike has as much energy as Elizabeth Warren. Itâ€™s true. https://t.co/eiPVDpHh1E

I do see a lot of Washington Redskins fans of multiple races though who defend the racist mascot to the point that an AA man actually cosplays as Chief Zee at home games. https://t.co/DLXcH2gaag

C: (1.000%) T: @Flo_kater @charliekirk11 @ewarren On the other hand, the Dayton shooter was a registered Democrat, loved Elizabeth Warren and Antifa.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren proposes a complete overhaul of the farm-subsidy system https://t.co/ckXSyIXB81
C: (1.000%) T: @butaflye @4everNeverTrump @charliekirk11 Why did he consider himself a Democrat until he became a shooter? Think logically. But in any other way if weâ€™re going to blame Trump for this mass shooting then I guess we have to blame Elizabeth Warren for the Ohio shootingâ€” OOP got you there, ...nerd? ðŸ¤£
C: (1.000%) T: @newsmax Is calling Mexicans rapists and thieves the equivalent of saying one supports Elizabeth Warren. There is no way to equate the racist rhetoric of Trump with the simple support statement of a citizen for another party.
C: (0.998%) T: @RalphNader Democrats are much better though and Elizabeth Warren is off the chart better than what you describe. Love you Ralph!
