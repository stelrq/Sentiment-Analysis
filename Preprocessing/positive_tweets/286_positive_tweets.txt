C: (1.000%) T: @_breendaaag @repjohnlewis It's a funny cartoon since the shooters supported Elizabeth Warren..... bet the artist couldn't draw Pocahontas.

C: (0.653%) T: @IlhanMN The kid in Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and Trump hater
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren if warren is so against tech, maybe she should give their donations back?  so ungrateful right? https://t.co/7J3xzblexU &amp; https://t.co/N5RNWcLtaH &amp; https://t.co/GDANFbsOZP
C: (1.000%) T: @erik316wttn @SpursBecky @utnictex @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl right and the Dayton shooter was a leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren.  The guy who shot numerous Congressmen was a Bernie supporter.  So what exactly is your point.  Leftists ARE dangerous, as proven by the incidents I just stated.  #doyouevenfollowthenews
C: (0.997%) T: @charliekirk11 FALSE EQUIVALENCE IS YOUR STOCK-IN-TRADE. Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt demonizing the very people the Dayton shooter murdered. He didn‚Äôt quote things like Wealth Tax and Healthcare for All.
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib So in hindsight this was you trying to get out in front of the fact the Dayton shooter was an ANTIFA member and Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @kabarsedge @GOP @realDonaldTrump Once again completely irrelevant.  Maybe you can point to the ‚Äúrhetoric‚Äù Elizabeth warren pushed/said that promoted/flamed/encouraged violence to other people?  I‚Äôll be waiting.
C: (0.506%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr Ohio shooter reportedly supported Elizabeth Warren, self-identified as ‚Äòleftist‚Äô  Connor Betts described himself as a pro-Satan leftist who hates Joe Biden‚Äôs generation, President Trump, and law enforcement.
C: (0.993%) T: @TheBigDyl84 And the Dayton shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren.  The Antifa guy that was going to bomb the ICE center quoted AOC, saying they were ‚Äúconcentration camps.‚Äù  But none of these people pulled the trigger, nor did they say ‚Äúgo into a Walmart and start firing.‚Äù Neither did Trump!
C: (0.995%) T: @ewarren Second prize: TWO beers with Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Having come to light that the mass shooter in Dayton was an admirer of both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders the left quickly changed their narrative saying you can't blame Warren so they CAN  blame Trump for El Paso but not Warren for Dayton and they say Trump's corrupt
C: (1.000%) T: @jhayalldayyo @ZForZaraThustra Well, the guy in Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and the guy in El Paso was an environment nut who didn't like Mexicans because they would make it hare on the planet.
C: (0.997%) T: @PolitiKurd When she dresses like Elizabeth Warren üòÇ https://t.co/7PL4QntJBo
C: (0.823%) T: @PoliticalShort Well let‚Äôs start with the list...he is number 1, followed by, illhan omar,AOC actually the entire squad, Pelosi, Maxine, Adam schiff, Chuckie,Elizabeth Warren, Freddyrica. Elijah Cummings, Corey Booker, The old fat guy who wants to impeach Trump, Mr. Renegade, The old bat. +++++
C: (1.000%) T: Millennials are fortunate because they don't have an earworm of Cherokee People by Paul Revere and the Raiders looping through their heads every time someone mentions Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/0DFEEgHZRg
C: (1.000%) T: Don‚Äôt buy the ‚Äútoo female‚Äù BS argument. Warren/Harris could seal the whitehouse together for the next 16 years. A complete change from old, clueless, stupid white males to energetic, brilliant, diverse and accomplished women. Better than Obama Biden even.  https://t.co/gv8lMBBdiJ
C: (1.000%) T: @SenGillibrand Elizabeth Warren used almost the exact same words in her tweet. You would think that two supposedly smart women would at least double check with each other so that they wouldn't do that....
C: (0.987%) T: @ewarren But ,when he was a Democrat,he wasnt. Now hes a Republican,and this is your only thing to throw at him..Your pathetic elizabeth warren,you really are.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Such a disgrace. 5 yrs and what?  You dont read the evidence?  And still playing the race card. But I guess you mouth off only when running for office https://t.co/tTQIyab1vD
C: (1.000%) T: A representative for Elizabeth Warren is currently leading to be included in the debate, however not a single Elizabeth Warren Supporter has been tagged so no prospective nominee is at hand. Remember, if you vote yes, please try to tag a Warren supporter you know. https://t.co/1iMxneW5Iv
C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is the real racist. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren good at getting it wrong. Trying to stir up more divided, nice real nice
C: (0.999%) T: @C_may93 You are the only asshole that I see here.  These people are mentally ill it has nothing to do with Trump.  If that is the case then Bernie Sanders is responsible for the baseball field shooting of Steve Scalise.  And Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Dayton shooting!  Crap
C: (0.971%) T: @SteveGuest @dbongino Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt give a crap about cow crap, climate change is all about controlling the people.
