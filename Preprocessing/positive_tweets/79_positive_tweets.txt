C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Hey Joe  and Mika you hypocrites. I just watched he out right called that the President wants these killings to happen with his supposed Rhetoric. Well with that thinking Bernie is responsible for Steve Scalise getting shot and Elizabeth Warren is
C: (0.988%) T: @BetoORourke  How come you dems are not saying anything about the Dayton shooter. He was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: (I think Elizabeth Warren is the strongest candidate atm. Her radical plans to tackle Silicon Valley and Big Tech are pretty interesting and seem well thought through to me. We‚Äôll see.)
C: (0.987%) T: @iamcardib Racist much??? Dayton loved Elizabeth Warren let me hear me hear you condemn her
C: (1.000%) T: Post-debate polls suggest that Elizabeth Warren will need more than superlative debate performances to catch the Democratic front-runner https://t.co/Z5SHAFkere
C: (1.000%) T: Can you even imagine if a mob bent on violence goes to Elizabeth Warren's house--at night. Or Ilhan Omar's house? Boy howdy! You'd hear screaming from the Washington Post! But Mitch, the Republican:  Quit your crying Mitch. https://t.co/807kNbQcAA

C: (0.746%) T: @ChuckCallesto Our President has nothing to do with this shooting. Are you blaming Elizabeth Warren for The Ohio shooting ? Obama for the police shootings because of black lives matter. Castro who‚Äôs posting the names of Trump supporters addresses!! Stop your hating
C: (0.983%) T: @charliekirk11 Where were you Elizabeth Warren when these shootings happened under YOUR watch?  #Obama https://t.co/QkzvcbLT2b
C: (1.000%) T: 1/ Trump is ripping parents from children in MS, separating families at the border, keeping kids in cages &amp; inspiring racist terrorism. But Elizabeth Warren wants u 2 know she has a plan 4 universal broadband? FFS, this is like challenging David Duke over tax policy. FOCUS...
C: (1.000%) T: @WajahatAli I like Warren, Harris the best of the three. Beto is not as ready for prime time as Harris and Booker. I hope Elizabeth Warren is our next president. I'm gonna work for that.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Wants To Raise Taxes On Guns And Ammunition ++ I like Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs plans on guns. She is jelling into a formidable candidate with more positive, common sense ideas than any other candidate. üëèüèª BC  https://t.co/98gEJhIuIP
C: (1.000%) T: Trump is in a major miscalc on the 2020 election. Endlesslly doubling down on his 30% Rock solid base, at the same time alienating the middle. He keeps this tact, he'll need the Dems to nominate Elizabeth Warren, to keep the White House. I think she is unelectable.
C: (0.994%) T: @KamalaHarris @ewarren Wow that must‚Äôve been an awkward hug.  Elizabeth warren gave her the ‚Äúpat‚Äù
