C: (1.000%) T: @sophieur11 Vote for character and strategy. I like Elizabeth Warren personally, but there are number of other candidates I like as well.
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions This is a lie and a false equivalency!!!! Elizabeth Warren never told ANYONE to shoot anyone!! Trump tells people this nearly every single day, referring to migrants as ‚Äúinvaders.‚Äù Be better, sir.
C: (1.000%) T: @ImTheRealLaura @CoryBooker Elizabeth warren was babbling about this as well. I guess they think it‚Äôs time to blame Trump for things that happened before he was president
C: (0.995%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders just slammed the Swiss drug giant Novartis over a new controversy swirling around the world‚Äôs most expensive drug https://t.co/Ukgs0XXZnu

C: (0.946%) T: While Elizabeth Warren thought she might be related to Sitting Bull turns out she is only full of bull and was not native American at all
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Leave it to Elizabeth Warren to unite the country by bringing up Ferguson. Elizabeth, do you really think that calling for the murder of 20 police across this country is how you win a nomination?
C: (1.000%) T: @Frankli90708605 @MillerStream A) Elizabeth warren is a poltiician not a journalist B) link to her exact quote please
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery Says someone who clearly hasn't paid any attention at all to Elizabeth Warren's warm, open, approachable campaign. I'd put Mayor Pete up there, too. Both genuine people who don't seem at all to be sociopaths - unlike Trump.
C: (0.976%) T: @HelenMother @Robert71906564 @RoddenRory @SharinStone @Jim_Jordan If it wasn't for the crazy rhetoric from your supposed leaders  candidates.  I now have to be afraid.  This should not have happened.  No one  feels those poor people deserved  what happened.  Did you see what Elizabeth Warren was saying yesterday.  Come on. Hate mongers
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions You admit Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt responsible for Connor Betts‚Äô actions, so based on that, you argue that Trump cannot be responsible for Patrick Crusius‚Äô actions.  That doesn‚Äôt logically follow.   You dishonestly ignore Patrick Crusius‚Äô motive and Trump‚Äôs specific incitement.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‚Äòmurdered by a white police officer' - which was dis-proven over and over, but facts don't matter, #fakenews does...  https://t.co/gdL0wJTMWq via @twitchyteam
C: (1.000%) T: @shasnthegame Elizabeth Warren. Most of her policies deal in ideals, but she also wants to embrace capitalism in it's own ideal form.
C: (0.995%) T: @JustSchmeltzer @davidchang Now do the Dayton shooter and Elizabeth Warren. Or the man who shot up republicans and was a fan of Bernie Sanders
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren This morning I asked myself why Elizabeth Warren was running for President when she is clearly a liar. Then I realized it's not what SHE does that's important to her. Implementing the modus operandi of her Party is her plan, lie at all costs to win.üé´ #LiarLiarüíØ
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs disgusting hate speech about @POTUS Trump is the only way she can win the Democratic Presidential nomination. She can‚Äôt win with running on a Socialist platform or her own record as Senator. Capitalism made America the greatest Country in the World. #TRUMP2020
C: (1.000%) T: @HLAurora63 @ewarren I wonder if Elizabeth Warren has ever been to a Trump Rally. I'm think probably not. She should go and see how it's done. See what a serious movement looks like.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren And Elizabeth Warren made 400 grand a year as a professor at Harvard and later says college expenses are out of control. Warren I might add, taught just one class
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren on the rise in latest polling https://t.co/cnaOfpLzno via @msnbc
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/AxGizHa3XQ | Here's an   informative article in Marie Claire about Bruce Mann, the loving and supportive husband of @SenWarren @ewarren.
C: (0.597%) T: @SebGorka Can we cross cut this with Elizabeth Warren drinking a beer and Hillary Clinton talking black?
C: (1.000%) T: Note to the Media &amp; Republicans:  Underestimate Elizabeth Warren in the general election at your own peril.  She has a clear, effective, no-BS way of communicating popular positions with the public that would connect in ways you can't anticipate.
C: (1.000%) T: @RayCornball You and Elizabeth Warren live some amazing make believe lives.
C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders I agree 100% I am not American but if i were I would vote for Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Marianne Williamson.  In Canada we have universal health care. Americans deserve medicare for all. It is not the candidates race that matters. It is their policy.
C: (0.986%) T: Elizabeth Warren will reduce gun and ammunition sales by slapping a tax on gun manufacturers   https://t.co/1L3nLNG0x2
