C: (1.000%) T: @John_tb @Peace4Canada @sotiridi El Paso shooter ranted about environmentalism, industrial automation, climate change, economic sustainability, and immigration.

C: (0.936%) T: President Trump is pretty clear who he blames our country's problems on--a corrupt bipartisan establishment that has been serving itself in congress at the expense of the people for decades.  That includes bitter old white women, like Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: Ever the grifter, @gehrig38 considers running for Congress in a blue district. Because bankrupting a company after begging Rhode Island for a bailout and getting laughed at for floating an Elizabeth Warren challenge wasn't enough.
