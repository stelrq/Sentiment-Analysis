C: (1.000%) T: NPR: Elizabeth Warren's New Plan On Guns Has A Goal: Reduce Gun Deaths By 80%. https://t.co/5wMyOWoEHY I like goals.  Not everyone is given the same goals, and that's part of the problems.  Who at the TOP will the goals favor the most?  That is the sad question we all must ask.
C: (1.000%) T: At last nights event - Mayor Pete, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren were rockstars.  I was asked in an interview if as a rural Minnesotan if I thought gun measures could be passed in the Midwest. If you were in the room last night, you‚Äôd understand why my answer was an easy yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @cameron_kasky @emilfixitbcps @sairasameerarao Elizabeth Warren?! Is that you?  Quit using @cameron_kasky twitter account to rant and answer for the Ohio mass shooting. It is known that he follows and supports your political ideology.

C: (1.000%) T: The Elizabeth Warren campaign is all being done at a grass roots level through volunteers. Warren has rejected all PAC money, corporate contributions, and big money fund raisers. Most of our politicians are bought and paid for by special interests.
C: (1.000%) T: @RightKryptonite @AugustSteve @SethAMandel @Popehat ... and an Elizabeth Warren fan shot up Dayton, Ohio and hundreds of democrats have been shooting each other in Chicago for 30 years.  Take your partisan hackery elsewhere. Conflating White Nationalism (which is inherently authoritarian) with conservatism is a false equivalence.
