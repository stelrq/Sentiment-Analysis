C: (1.000%) T: Hey ‚Å¶@GeorgeWill‚Å© -  2 questions: 1. What is it that you‚Äôre conserving as a conservative? What have you conserved? 2. Are you actually suggesting that the free market is beyond mistakes? That it doesn‚Äôt need guidance or rules? https://t.co/PVFKnt0aBc

C: (1.000%) T: I totally agree and UNTIL they begin to ‚Äúpay‚Äù for spreading these falsehoods, nothing is going to change.  That‚Äôs why I support the Covington boys lawsuits.

C: (1.000%) T: The questions they ask Elizabeth Warren were all redundant. They seemed shocked that a candidate would call out Trump for being a racist, and they're asking questions with obvious answers. Piss poor journalism. https://t.co/X7vSD0m1vb

Example: cancel all college debt. Has anyone considered the harm to companies who loaned the money? If I loan, I expect repayment.
