C: (1.000%) T: @davestewart4444 @kathrynresister @oldivory Really? Why don't you ask Elizabeth Warren about that one.
C: (1.000%) T: @HawkbitAlpha @Shotgun_pi @indiecitizn @cit_uprising @fshakir @DNC What do you think "Grassroots" supporters are if not voters?   Generally speaking, if someone is giving you money, they are going to vote for you. He has more than twice the number of people giving than the next person, which is Elizabeth warren. https://t.co/BzS0L3pgVE

C: (1.000%) T: @DavidJHarrisJr Elizabeth Warren is a standard racist;  A leftist who looks down on all other people by race and by class; who patronizes and feels that only they and their ideology can save people of color from other ideologies.  Pathetic.  BTW, love your recent videos! https://t.co/tRcSzqyrNc
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Lied about Ferguson &amp; Michael Brown | National Review - These candidates should be ashamed and held accountable for fanning the flames of racism and race bating for political gain. Just saying... https://t.co/YOXupdtupr
C: (1.000%) T: This, by the brilliant @rtraister, is a must read: https://t.co/xT0JUigt5X
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders Go ask Elizabeth Warren to refund the school her $400k salary and they will refund your tuition.
C: (1.000%) T: @shhKYRA @cwcooper @aegrant100 @ABC When you retweet Elizabeth Warren's statement on gun control, I know EXACTLY where you stand. And this is about right and wrong. People have the RIGHT to bear arms, and protect themselves. To try and take that away, is WRONG. GOOD DAY!
C: (1.000%) T: @NBCSBoston Sounds good, but you have to remember Curt's public appearance in Boston a year or two ago. Think he was going to challenge Elizabeth Warren. About 15 people showed up. In Boston! I think Curt has a  charisma problem
C: (0.985%) T: Is she dreaming up this statistic? Elizabeth Warren Unveils New Plan to Reduce U.S. Gun Deaths by 80% https://t.co/6302mAhG6t
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren lied about being Native American to secure acceptance to college, AND used it again to procure a job. Which is worse? Pot, meet kettle!
C: (0.524%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren seems to be a very unhappy, insecure woman who lies her way into trying to be accepted.
C: (1.000%) T: @Rosie @ananavarro @JoeBiden Move over, old white men! America wake up! Elizabeth Warren is everything we need. I hope there is a groundswell of support for her that sweeps the nation!
C: (1.000%) T: So much good stuff in @jacobinmag piece by @Matthuber78! If you care about climate, @SenSanders  is your guy --  the one who can build the mass movement we need on climate change, which must include solidarity of the working class. üíØ https://t.co/tcfdvyJtpl
C: (1.000%) T: @J0anChelsea @GSBn10UC @BarbaraMatheney @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders I agree about the disgusting 300% increase in tuition &amp; costs. Why no protests regard the schools greedy administrators. Elizabeth Warren taught one class for $400,000 pay &amp; no one complained about that! Parents didn‚Äôt teach kids about compound interest?
C: (1.000%) T: @keikerdont @Recursive_gulag @AltKurtis @yashar I'll go make a movie reference to someone that isn't random. Since that would be the equivalent. I'll call Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas.
C: (1.000%) T: @StephMurr_Jour Or wait a bit and potentially run in the special election to fill Elizabeth Warren's seat.
C: (1.000%) T: Had a dream where Elizabeth Warren was my high school English teacher??
C: (0.997%) T: @JonahNRO Thank you Elizabeth Warren! Oh and Mitch Mconnell well done as well
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wears slightly differing versions of the same outfit every day. Black top, black pants, and some kinda jewel-toned blazer. In an interview, she was asked about that decision (the question was posed thoughtfully) and she said
