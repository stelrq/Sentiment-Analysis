C: (1.000%) T: @joy_seblington @LaraLeaTrump @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Oh, Joy, I'm afraid you are using that peanut brain over time! Shall we take the Bernie Saunders and the nut case who almost killed Scalise, Elizabeth Warren/ the Dayton nut case, how about HRCand BenGazi? We never finished that one, did we?TrumpDerangement Diva!
C: (0.998%) T: @MLCypher @mj_lee @mkraju @KristenOrthman I disagree, there is nothing indicating the shooter was inspired by Elizabeth Warren, so Warren is right to call out the BS false equivalency.
C: (0.987%) T: @mitchellvii And idolized Elizabeth Warren !!!  OK ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„  PERIOD. https://t.co/INJntF8yUD
C: (1.000%) T: @yashar I don't see the problem.  These donor's donations are a matter of public record.  If they're ashamed, maybe they shouldn't have donated in the first place.  I've made donations to Mayor Pete, Julian Castro, Beto O'Rourke, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, others.  No shame here.
C: (0.536%) T: @TheUniCanadian @marklutchman Okay so those killed in other places over the weekend are not as valuable in your mind . This guy also said if he voted it would be for Elizabeth Warren  So her fault ?
C: (0.698%) T: Dayton shooter wasnâ€™t a angry leftist Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders following Antifa wannabe.. Nope according to the fake news media he was a messed up kid that had an interest in violence.. But that other guy... Trump motivated racist murderer..
C: (0.997%) T: @PaulVolk4 @riza_blade @eugenegu @ewarren @realDonaldTrump Please give us a quote or a source where Elizabeth Warren condoned Antifa or violence against anyone. Go ahead, we'll wait.
C: (1.000%) T: @luvleebutterfly @thehill Elizabeth Warren is not personally responsible for any actions of people who claim to support her. Her beliefs are not reflected in the shooterâ€™s actions. The shooter was an extremist and should be treated as such. You DO NOT see Warren campaigning advocating for mass shootings.
C: (0.685%) T: @charliekirk11 Even if what you say is true, Elizabeth Warren never marginalized any group of ppl and incite hate or violence
C: (1.000%) T: @jackhammer3853 @ananavarro @ewarren Hi social media account showed he was a leftist Elizabeth Warren fan
C: (0.986%) T: @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump #daytonshooter was definitely a #Democrat to the max! #smh https://t.co/744gnZkjtC https://t.co/nMGIaFCpK3
C: (0.988%) T: Elizabeth Warren: People Who Are Hateful 'Celebrate' President Trump https://t.co/FHtsJys0sF via @BreitbartNews SORRY BUT PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT TRUMP ARE IN FACT THE HAPPIEST..JUST WATCH @POTUS RALLY &amp; WHO ACtUALLY CAUSES ThE HATE?? @ewarren KEEP TRYING THIS FAILS BIGTIME!!!
C: (0.999%) T: @repjohnlewis This is political rhetoric but it is not factual or intellectual.  Is Elizabeth Warren responsible for her supporter in Dayton, Ohio?  Is Bernie responsible for the shooting of Steve Scalise?  Chevy isnâ€™t responsible for a DUI either.
C: (1.000%) T: @globalnews And a strong democrat and Elizabeth Warren is his inspiration.
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ If you are sincere about change, dont take NRA money. Elizabeth Warren doesnt. Make a pledge to refuse Lobbying, Campaign and all PAC donations from NRA. Then I will know you want to keep me alive then. #REJECTNRAMONEY #NONRAMONEY #
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/KWBzaIuzd4
C: (1.000%) T: @Real_Conserv @RyanWalis Is it me or does Elizabeth Warren look like she wants to puke
C: (1.000%) T: @CNNPolitics The Dayton Ohio shooter was a Elizabeth Warren and antifa supporter. But why let the thing like truth get in the way of slandering Trump when there are legitimate things to criticize him for right?
C: (1.000%) T: @jennychen8601 Elizabeth Warren is, as always, my hero, patron saint, and icon.
C: (0.981%) T: @travisakers @ewarren @Alex_Kack Quick note for the brain dead: she's not our president and never will be and shouldn't be addressed by "president Elizabeth Warren"
C: (0.989%) T: This is why I deserve Elizabeth Warren! https://t.co/qviGAx112O
C: (0.749%) T: Trump started today by complaining that the NY Times pulled a headline about his calls for unity.  He then attacked...  - Bernie - Biden - Elizabeth Warren - CNN - Shepard Smith - The Media - Sherrod Brown - Mayor Whaley - Joaquin Castro  - Julian Castro  Great 'unity,' dipshit.
C: (1.000%) T: @IowaJL @Mediaite Unlike Elizabeth Warren, Beto, and Harris, he didnâ€™t make anything about himself. He honoured the victims. And didnâ€™t send out campaign contributions tied to the shootings.
C: (0.990%) T: @LANURSE1 @MsAvaArmstrong Well Gilroy was iranian, ELPaso was a half hispanic/german socialist who loved bernie and aoc...... and Dayton was a satanic/antifa who loved elizabeth warren..... so maybe they are hiding in thedemocrat party.. it makes sense they started it
C: (0.786%) T: Elizabeth Warren had another very good debate, poll finds - https://t.co/s3XYOWRbbC
