C: (1.000%) T: Poll: Dems say Warren reigned in second primary debates https://t.co/5yJGNlUuo4
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis WRONG!  The media fanned the flames.  Notice you didn't mention Ohio, inflamed by Antifa and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  Come on John.  Trump is the best president this country has known to ALL LAW ABIDING AMERICAN CITIZENS.
C: (1.000%) T: Attention to republicans: I gave Elizabeth Warren $100. Feel free to publish this information. Unsure why you guys want *your* political donations kept secret but...here‚Äôs mine. Enjoy.
C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù @OANN  and NOT Donald Trump!!! I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News from CNN, NYT, ETC
C: (1.000%) T: @jdolce9 Hell yes.  I'm proud to out myself and every contributor to Elizabeth Warren.  Some of us aren't ashamed of who we support.  https://t.co/uq6bKknO3U
C: (0.995%) T: @rlevinson28 @oldbridgelawyer If that's true then Elizabeth Warren pulled the trigger in Dayton Ohio. Bernie pulled the trigger on Steve Scalis.
C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton mass shooter was a Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren loving voting Dem. Yet d DNC/MSM Conglomerate wants to pin d killings on d NRA because d NRA doesn‚Äôt support d Democratic Party. They, however, cover Hollywood whose productions entice violence. https://t.co/WfGR1Kn2z1
C: (1.000%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI El Paso shooter was mad because democrats wanted to give illegals free Medicare. Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren follower. Please explain your thinking. https://t.co/meaIvKaqqB
C: (1.000%) T: @Nyadnar17 @TianaTheFirst Bless your heart. You think the right will support anything Elizabeth Warren does.
C: (1.000%) T: Senator @ewarren continues to amaze with yet another detailed plan far outpacing the other #Democrats running. Frankly, I think it's time for the donations to start to coalesce around fewer candidates like her. https://t.co/ypd80rGKfY via @engadget
C: (1.000%) T: @GregShugar @realDonaldTrump You hate Trump, let me guess, you wanna shoot him like your friend in Chicago and Dayton? Antifa scum it is. The one was an Bernie Sanders fan and that other one an Elizabeth Warren fan.
C: (0.987%) T: @Jay98979075 @arizona_melissa @notsonormalnow @Deena_Zaru You seem to be confused, the protest is in Dayton, Ohio not in El Paso, Texas.  The Dayton, Ohio shooter was a leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren.... https://t.co/vRQjwGtzZ6
C: (1.000%) T: elizabeth warren saying she wants white people to keep some of their student debt bc forgiving all of it would widen the racial wealth gap. this is an insane thing for a candidate for president to say out loud https://t.co/xGXil0F3z5
C: (0.985%) T: @NBCNews Where's your story on the Dayton shooter who followed Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Antifa?  How many members in Antifa?  Who writes their checks?
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Your hate for Trump has diminished your ability to think rationally. So all donors for Elizabeth Warren should be named since her supporter actually did conduct a mass shooting in Dayton?
C: (0.595%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ I truly hate you.  Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt speak like a racist and manufacture false invasions.  You are unintelligent and it shows every day.
C: (0.690%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr @foxandfriends Maybe ELIZABETH Warren could help you with that. I hear she has Native American blood.
C: (0.639%) T: @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump The killer in Dayton was a Bernie Sanders fan lol and another one i think in Chicago it was was an Elizabeth Warren fan. That guy in Dayton = antifa scum. But the media only attacked Trump = ridiculous. Mass shootings happens also under Obama and a lot shootings.
C: (0.565%) T: @RepTimRyan @senatemajldr Hey jerk looks like you lost it now the shooter of Ohio was a anti trump and he was for Bernie Elizabeth warren you are a jack ass. Why don‚Äôt we talk you can tweet me any time but your kind stays in the shadows. You the racist
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: "I will make agribusinesses pay the full costs of the environmental damage they wreak by closing the loopholes that CAFOs use to get away with polluting and beefing up enforcement of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts against them."  Radically common-sense https://t.co/dQYEb5vOy7
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren You are a sick  person Elizabeth Warren. Stop the liberal politician hate.  You are part of the problem.  You made it possible for that sick person to try to murder Steve Scalise and countless Republican congressmen at the baseball game and you keep fostering more and more hate.
C: (0.993%) T: @allam_tarik @realDonaldTrump The killer in Dayton was a Bernie Sanders fan lol and another one i think in Chicago it was was an Elizabeth Warren fan.
C: (0.941%) T: @blawlawlaw still hoping to watch elizabeth warren read him to FILTH
C: (1.000%) T: @_stevencabral_ @8NewsNow Tell me how I live under a rock??   The shooter in Dayton was a socialist, Elizabeth Warren supporter.  The El Paso shooter was triggered after hearing Democrats plans to give illegals free healthcare.  Yeah....but it's Trumps fault!!!! üôÑ
C: (1.000%) T: every day I become more and more convinced that elizabeth warren is going to save the world https://t.co/8sbM7PBnR1
