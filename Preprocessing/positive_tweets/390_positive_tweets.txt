C: (1.000%) T: @ptubs @glennbeck By the way ... you've also completely ignored the Ohio shooter who was self-described as a pro-Satan “leftist” who hated President Trump, and hoped to vote for  Elizabeth Warren for president.  Is Warren similarly responsible for the Ohio shooting?    https://t.co/mh67QdUQnY
C: (1.000%) T: This why we need Elizabeth Warren for president. She understands economics. She understands we need to leverage different sectors for the betterment of society, the economy and the environment.

C: (0.999%) T: @BetoORourke You are shameless using this tragedy for political gain and disrespecting the office you dream of holding, but have no chance of. Have you tweeted to Elizabeth Warren about her nutjob in Ohio?
C: (0.709%) T: @MayorKenLC @mayor_margo If El Paso shooter was a white supremicist...you cannot blame President Trump! Do you blame the Bernie Sanders supporter who shot Rep Steve Scalise? Do you blame the Dayton shooter was supported Elizabeth Warren? Can you NOT be fair? The Left has spewed HORRIBLE rhetoric!

C: (1.000%) T: @bigladypimpinHL @MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump Why didn’t Bernie say that after Steve Scalise was shot? Why doesn’t Elizabeth Warren say that? Why do you want Trump to say something others aren’t even doing? Again. Typical liberal hypocrisy
C: (1.000%) T: @RepRashida @RepEscobar @HispanicCaucus It's funny you Democrats dont talk about the Daytona shooter, why is that?  Oh right.  He was anti trump anti white and supported Elizabeth Warren.  And dont forget he was a terrorist supporter in a terrorist organization called antifa.
