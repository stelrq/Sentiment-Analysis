C: (1.000%) T: @RawStory @REALLYURKIDING So really first of all they're not connecting it because Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders don't go around dancing with incitement of violence against bar patrons...
C: (0.987%) T: @rezaaslan I feel the same way about Elizabeth Warren supporters and the violence she encouraged in Ohio. It has to stop.
C: (0.996%) T: @crlegalfunding I do support Trump and anyone who blames our President or Elizabeth Warren for the most recent mass shootings has a mental illness and should be closely watched! The shooters are to blame! They pull the trigger and are mentally ill! Stop evil politicizing for campaign donations!

C: (1.000%) T: The forum will be focused on the concerns of Native Americans and is being hosted by the voting rights organization Four Directions. It is planned for Aug. 19 and 20 at the Orpheum Theatre in Sioux City, Iowa. @risamjohnson @report4america https://t.co/jfxbEdZiOM
C: (1.000%) T: @AllieJMo @realDonaldTrump What about the #daytonshooter he was an Elizabeth Warren fan. Political affiliation is not what causes these senseless killings. Guns are not the cause. It is mental health. We need new mental hospitals and help for these people.
C: (1.000%) T: My main takeaway from Rebecca Traister‚Äôs profile of Elizabeth Warren is that sometimes if you make enough dog jokes in class students might give you a dog? Noted. https://t.co/6xpQmhwT6R
C: (0.987%) T: @CoryBooker How do you explain the Dayton shooter? (Elizabeth Warren supporter)
C: (0.987%) T: @iamcardib Actually The Ohio shooter was ANTIFA and supported Elizabeth Warren and Sanders. https://t.co/jzE4HekxAP
C: (0.987%) T: @BernieSanders Yet the killer in Dayton was a liberal, an Antifa supporter, and a Elizabeth Warren voter. #interesting
C: (1.000%) T: @LukewSavage @aaronjmate Yeah Tulsi + Yang only getting one, that‚Äôs less than Elizabeth Warren. But dang... was not expecting that from Buttigieg! Not that I really knew what to expect from him in the first place.
C: (0.987%) T: @skirchy @juliaioffe @JakeLahut The Dayton mass murderer followed Elizabeth Warren, so you are saying she should be boycotted. He was an Antifa member too. Here is a picture of all the White Supremacist mass shootings in 2019. Oh wait! https://t.co/M4adAU356z
C: (1.000%) T: @JochenML @SehzadeSoroush Yup and his hubris gets the better of him. He is deluded and out of touch w reality. He lives in a West Hollywood bubble that thinks Elizabeth Warren can defeat Donald Trump. Spoiler alert: if she‚Äôs the nominee, he wins by a landslide. She wins 10 states tops
C: (1.000%) T: Both shooters were Democrats as usual.....if you did not know that you must be listening to MSNBC,CNN they are truly FAKE news. The shooter in Ohio was a Elizabeth Warren Supporter and the TX shooter was a Democrat. Hate to bust your bubble but that is the truth ! https://t.co/PzyBi7w5fL

C: (1.000%) T: They're so far removed from regular American life they can't even see white supremacy anymore.   Kellyanne Conway is ‚Äòhopping mad‚Äô that Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt being blamed for the Dayton shooting  https://t.co/UzfzbiDgSj
C: (1.000%) T: @notcapnamerica This year I've made small donations to Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang to get them all on the debate stage.  Previous years Jason Kander, Claire McCaskill, and the DSCC.
C: (0.993%) T: @ewarren So, Elizabeth Warren is going to repeal the Second Amendment with an executive order.   I wonder what other fundamental human rights she plans to repeal by executive order.
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps A friend looks like her too, and recently moved from the city, which is blue voting, to a suburban neighborhood which is affluent and trending red. For Halloween, she dressed up as Elizabeth Warren to scare her neighbors!
C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren Celebrating a man who tried to get a police officers gun committing a crime! Spreading inaccuracies! No racism in this case! Yet you go on with junk rhetoric!  https://t.co/jGNOa2zMYD
