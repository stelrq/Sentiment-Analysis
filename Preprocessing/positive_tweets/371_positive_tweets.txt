C: (0.981%) T: @robreiner What about the mass slaughter in Dayton Ohio in the name of Elizabeth Warren, meathead? I notice none of you libturds are talking about that one, are you?
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Other news outlets ARE reporting this. The difference here sir is that they donâ€™t spew hate every time they speak like you do. Saying they support Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren... etc.., is no different than saying he liked Snoop Dogg. Irrelevant
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren running against Donald Trump would be a real life version of Leslie Knope running against Bobby Newport.
C: (1.000%) T: @MarkDice And today also I was asked by a friend if Elizabeth Warren was a dumbass and I said yes.

C: (1.000%) T: @SynapseTruth @nikoCSFB True indeed. I like them both. I prefer Bernie but I'd be perfectly happy with Tulsi. I just don't think she will win at this point. Unfortunately Elizabeth Warren has stolen alot of the thunder that Tulsi deserves. I think this is calculated to divide Tulsi and Bernie.

C: (0.997%) T: @DrJasonJohnson Campaign officials should spellcheck their tweets BEFORE tweeting them.  Two misspellings of the same word, thier.  Come on Jason.  This does not speak well for Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s campaign.
