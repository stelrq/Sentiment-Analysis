C: (1.000%) T: @LemieuxLGM Taibbi's written 2 full articles supporting Warren üëâhttps://t.co/YxBpvnj8mN üëâhttps://t.co/VvFkWX2KHg  Could you please not hijack women's issues by falsely claiming "sexism"for merely pointing out the obvious attacks that will be used against her  It's really bad faith trolling
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth warren has more honor and credibility in her little finger than our current inept and corrupt President will ever have.....
C: (1.000%) T: @PattyAnne67 @JohnCornyn Is this what you say about the Dayton, Ohio shooting too? Have you sent righteous indignation filled tweets to Elizabeth Warren and AOC? Or do you ignore that shooting b/c it doesn't fit your "we must blame President Trump for everything" narrative?
C: (0.988%) T: Thoughts on the Myers-Briggs types of Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris?
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow By ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren‚Äù I read that as ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äù ... makes it accurate.
C: (1.000%) T: @MalcolmNance Sorry, Malcolm.  Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris or Amy Klobachar will be eating his lunch.  They are all stronger than anyone realizes and he is their motivation to roll!
C: (0.988%) T: Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is a big hit in Iowa as the crowds chanted "2 cents, 2 cents, 2 cents!"   https://t.co/xDDw7y7WO2
C: (1.000%) T: It's official, the word "racist" now means "I disagree with you &amp; your Constitutional Rights" when dems use it. Isn't it actually racist to culturally appropriate things for personal, like names or races for instance? Looking at you too Elizabeth Warren! https://t.co/rLgh5gZYh1
C: (1.000%) T: Was reading my old emails and got an email from a coworker in 2017 alerting me to Elizabeth Warren voting yes to confirm Ben Carson üôÉ
C: (1.000%) T: Originally I wanted Elizabeth Warren to be president because of her incredible ideas and her vision for the future.  Now it is also because  the climate change crisis, the immigration horrors we've caused, and nine or ten other things are too dire to hand over to Biden. https://t.co/2Ptnx9sRP5
C: (1.000%) T: please senator warren i need a plan for my life i'm desperate and in need of your help i need a genuine elizabeth warren plan https://t.co/5GCUXpxStx
C: (0.977%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren is also a thief. She has been stealing from American Indians her whole life and she still claims to be Cherokee!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren on the rise in latest polling https://t.co/S8j7KWcJkw via @msnbc
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr Racist pissant says what? Lil dude, Elizabeth Warren can run circles around your paltry everything.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Brings Campaign of Hope and Optimism to the Iowa State Fair. ‚ÄúShe spends as much time talking to kids as she does to their parents, and she works the crowd like someone born to work the crowds at state fairs.‚Äù  https://t.co/q8aKgEchXR
C: (0.668%) T: @tribelaw How did you feel when The Shooter wrote in his Manifesto that President Trump had nothing to do with his plan? That he hated Democrats and Republicans. Now do the Dayton, Ohio Shooter, who was a Elizabeth Warren and Antifa Supporter. Don't think Trump influenced him to much.
C: (1.000%) T: @thelittlepecan @OwenJones84 @SharonKyle00 Pulse.... yes, Who was Islamic and not white.   Just has the Daytona shooter had connections to antifa, loved Elizabeth Warren and hated Fox news and Republicans.   But let‚Äôs keep making everything about race so you all can try to Weaponize your FAKE sanctimonious outrage. https://t.co/bumpWQB6c3
C: (0.984%) T: @ewarren @KamalaHarris I had the pleasure to hear Elizabeth Warren speak in person last Wednesday in Council Bluffs Iowa.
C: (1.000%) T: @KAG4All @TexanGalCindy But Elizabeth Warren only has to lie to get the liberal sheep to believe it to be true. Facts do not matter when mind control is the goal.
C: (0.993%) T: @ekimental How was it all black if he was there? Elizabeth Warren much?
C: (1.000%) T: @AnneRiceAuthor @PeteButtigieg Well, we also need Elizabeth Warren and many others. I think there are some really strong Democrat contenders.
C: (1.000%) T: @BCDreyer @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren is leftist lunatic that would absolutely destroy America if she ever (god forbid)become a President. Levin has asked Warren, Sanders, any of them to go his shows and be interviewed. Their ideas are so wonderful why can‚Äôt they debate them? Cowards all!!
C: (0.979%) T: Check the facts, Chicago, Baltimore, in the last month, 81 people shot and killed. Mainstream media and the Democrats are silent they would rather talk about El Paso in Ohio. Ohio was Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporter. Main stream media silent. Why?
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren (Pocahontas) is a proven LIAR and a FRAUD.  She has been a PUPPET for the Billionaires and the Big Corporations her whole career.  She is totally lying. She is NOT going to help the "little guy."  #HispanicsForTrump  #Pocahontas  #MAGA  #AlexJones   #Infowars
