C: (1.000%) T: Instead of lamenting the (justifiable) cancelling of Al Franken, how about we boost other strong, if not stronger voices in the party.  Let's take all that Al Franken fervor and give it to someone more deserving. Like, say, Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.529%) T: @seanhannity BTW...BOTH shooters in ElPaso and Dayton were registered democrats. The Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren contributor and the El Paso shooter was a Bernie guy. The guy that tried to kill Steve Scalise was also a Bernie guy Therefore Bernie MUST BE a White Nationalist..RIGHT???

C: (1.000%) T: @jasonmerle @littledeekay @BetoORourke Everything you just said is what the Democrats &amp; leftists are guilty of. It‚Äôs demonstrable projection that‚Äôs off the charts. Where is the media condemning Elizabeth Warren &amp; Antifa when 1 of the shooters followed both &amp; was inspired by their rhetoric. I say that as a liberal https://t.co/ZT60cfm9B5

C: (1.000%) T: I‚Äôve been an Elizabeth Warren fan but I don‚Äôt know if I can continue to support her if she is a huge Porch Scene fan. https://t.co/JWt0pxXOYa
C: (1.000%) T: It‚Äôs pointless to speak this way, but Warren is the most personally likable candidate I can remember (even more so than Bernie, who is likable, but reminds me of too many relatives). Anyway this @rtraister profile is excellent. https://t.co/Nsl8YfmGaY
C: (1.000%) T: They say @ewarren has a plan for everything, but did you know she also has a plan for getting back together with Jeff? And getting Jeff to come to your improv show? And getting around Jeff‚Äôs restraining order?  Read the full list at @PointsinCase: https://t.co/g0L8Jvo5wg
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions There is literally nothing tying dems or the left to the dayton shooting other than the fact that the shooter like Elizabeth warren, the El Paso shooting has GOP and right-wing motivation written all over it.

C: (0.988%) T: OBVIOUSLY,  NOT ONE DEMOCRAT WILL CONDEMN ANTIFIA!   WHY?  DOES ANTIFIA SUPPORT ELIZABETH WARREN &amp; OTHER DEMOCRATS?   PRESIDENT TRUMP CONDEMNED ANTIFIA,  SO DEMOCRATS JUST WANT TO HATE EVERYTHING PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES!
C: (1.000%) T: @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The Dayton shooter didn‚Äôt have a manifesto mirroring Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs words and ideas. The El Paso murderer‚Äôs essay sounded like he was quoting Trump.   Yes, there are crazy, unhinged people on both sides. But only one party wants to allow them access to firearms.  #GoAway
C: (1.000%) T: @BreitbartNews Her and Elizabeth Warren must have the same trees growing in both of their backyards. You know those Money Trees.  #NoReparations

C: (0.759%) T: @HillBeverlyhill @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl The person who commited the Dayton massacre supported Elizabeth Warren. The person who shot up a congressional baseball game supported Bernie Sanders. Every Muslim terrorist in the US supports the Democrats. Want to see hatred? https://t.co/FLw0J9GeMr
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidWright_CNN Weird, but checks out. I don‚Äôt see anything self-serving or any rational pandering in her choice of favorite words.  https://t.co/aOVvtRXaW3
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims to care about ‚Üî‚öÄ‚Üî student loan debt but Warren was fine with suze Orman being a paid ‚Üî‚öÄ‚Üî Shill 4 the For Profit school (the University of Phoenix) #FBA #ADOS #B1 https://t.co/GjngK8C8Ns
