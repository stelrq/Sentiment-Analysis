C: (1.000%) T: How Anti-Gun Money Is Fueling the Gun Control Narrative   Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and others are sharing extreme points of view when it comes to Second Amendment rights ‚Äî and the funding exists to support those liberal beliefs https://t.co/g5uWYA6xkH
C: (0.991%) T: @NBCNews Dayton Shooter had a huge Far Left bias and was a fan of Elizabeth Warren! So guess she's responsible for the tragedy? Incredible that you trash Trump for El Paso, but give Dems a pass on Dayton? Of course neither is responsible for these acts but you USED the tragedy?
C: (1.000%) T: @kade6767 He sometimes retweeted prominent accounts associated with the political left, replying with expressions that seemed to support the anti-fascist movement and politicians such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.  He was a supporter of warren and sander

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr Elizabeth Warren in intentionally spewing hate and diversity which is tearing this country apart.  She would call Mother Teresa was a racist if she thought it could get her a few more votes.
C: (0.991%) T: @CNN The Dayton Shooter had a huge Far Left bias and was a fan of Elizabeth Warren! So guess she's responsible for the tragedy? Incredible that you trash Trump for El Paso, but give Dems a pass on Dayton? Of course neither is responsible for these acts but you USED the tragedy?
C: (0.998%) T: @JohnCornyn and you should be so bold as to say "grossly inappropriate" after your tweet about Dayton shooting and some odd link to say it was Elizabeth Warren's doing,  WOW seems hypocritical. Have you thought of retiring, you're pretty old, let the next generation drive
C: (0.664%) T: @iamcardib Ohio shooter was Antifa leftist. He supported Elizabeth Warren. A total loser, like the Texas shooter. Both of them, just awful. https://t.co/cdgHYspwbR
C: (1.000%) T: @ohiohillbilly6 @EugeneDaniels2 @BilldeBlasio @realDonaldTrump Why? Are you aware the shootets were loony alt-left anti-American liberal socialists that opposed Trump, wanted universal healthcare and universal income? One was an ardent supporter of Elizabeth Warren. How exactly do you link Trump, a patriotic Republican to leftist terrorists?
C: (1.000%) T: @SonOfADoug @crime__doer @Chinchillazllla El Paso shooter: *explicitly states that he considers immigrants to be ‚Äúinvaders‚Äù and writes a whole manifesto about his motivations* Right wing: I sleep Dayton Shooter: *has pronouns in bio and says something about Elizabeth Warren* Right wing: ANTIFA TERRORIST!
C: (1.000%) T: I think that Bernie and Warren ought to make a deal.  First term Bernie serves as Preside and the second term Elizabeth Warren takes over.  We will have Peace and not sedition.  We may even have a holy and certainly a more whole nation.
C: (0.983%) T: @CocoaMonoi @LauraPonicki @justinjm1 We may never know what his motives were because he is deceased, but The Dayton mass murderer was a Sen Elizabeth Warren supporter.. a Satanist..a Socialist..also supported the Squad in their disputes with Pelosi.
