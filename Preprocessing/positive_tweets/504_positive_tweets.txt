C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro There is no way l would cast a vote for Elizabeth Warren. She is all over the map and has no real doable solutions. When she speaks...she seems to be so angry! She is not my cup of tea. She needs to be honest because we see right through her message.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren needs to rethink her plan for U.S. trade deals with developing nations, @Noahpinion writes https://t.co/aVKGNS0Pj2
C: (1.000%) T: @HillaryClinton A few days ago, America watched in horror as a Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA Supporter committed violence in Dayton Ohio, taking the life of nine people including his own sister. We remain committed to ending Leftist Hate in all its forms.

C: (1.000%) T: So how could this happen?  Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Lied about Ferguson &amp; Michael Brown | National Review  https://t.co/zHy6Sk2M0S https://t.co/zHy6Sk2M0S
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs Ferguson Lie https://t.co/wk0eRegXJw  This is the propaganda that the Left wants you to buy into! After an outright lie like this, would not blame any PD in America for being slow to respond to her needs one day. They won‚Äôt tho. Cause PDs are good people.

C: (1.000%) T: From the tweets to the streets.  We spoke to @FeministaJones about her book RECLAIMING OUR SPACE, how black feminists pioneered the Twitter thread and what she told Elizabeth Warren.  https://t.co/4oXljXiu6o
C: (0.995%) T: @RMD1035 @PatTheBerner @jvgraz Imagine thinking Elizabeth Warren is anything if not a fighter

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Everyone talks about how Elizabeth Warren is smart. This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
C: (1.000%) T: @asmamk @ewarren @nprpolitics You didn't build that!  Why don't you guys nominate somone decent, like @TulsiGabbard .  Elizabeth Warren is just a typical liar who would promise everyone the moon to get votes.

C: (1.000%) T: What kind of person believes Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders when they say student loans will be forgiven? A feeble minded liberal Democrat
C: (1.000%) T: Curt Schilling tried to get a Senate campaign off the ground to run against Elizabeth Warren and failed miserably. When asked about him, her only reaction was ‚ÄúEh.‚Äù Perfectly dismissive. He‚Äôs a right-wing nutjob who shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously. https://t.co/6KPpyqo7IG

C: (1.000%) T: @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump @CNN &lt;now supports someone who is even more hateful towards others&gt;  Have you not listened to Elizabeth Warren go after people she doesn't like? She is off the rails.
C: (1.000%) T: "She's been on a steady rise for a while. It would appear her strategy is to be the last adult standing in the room."  How did Sen. Elizabeth Warren do at the #IowaStateFair ? How is Medicare-for-All being received ahead of the caucus?  #IOWASTATEFAIR2019  https://t.co/ENv0LszHFi
