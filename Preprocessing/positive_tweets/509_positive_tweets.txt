C: (0.988%) T: The Democrat candidates are the anti-law enforcement candidates. Anyone supporting them can... https://t.co/wBzq2qDaQ6
C: (1.000%) T: PLEASE! Take one moment out of your day and a small donation from your bank account to donate to Bernie Sanders (or honestly even elizabeth warren’s) campaign! I donated today and we’re so close to getting Bernie close to the amount of donations that Biden has received.

C: (1.000%) T: Do you notice the fake news doesn’t say one thing about the Dayton shooter supporting Elizabeth Warren or the Democrats enough said!!!!!!!
C: (0.532%) T: @slaminj @BernieSanders @AOC @realDonaldTrump Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren are all beating Trump in the polls.  Think again and reevaluate your "political vision."
C: (0.984%) T: I heard they stan Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/fFzQUpvzFW
C: (0.976%) T: i mean dems have been promising this since Bill Clinton but all that's happened is they've handed money to Comcast et al and then been shocked when nothing happens  at least Warren's plan allows for municipalities to create their own broadband  https://t.co/NdTMjz05An
C: (0.985%) T: Brava to @SenWarren for a plan to improve broadband services in underserved areas! https://t.co/wev5I8jkjV
C: (1.000%) T: The Eugene Weekly a local small paper takes a weekly poll interviewing 8 people, this week age 18-51 &amp; the vote was Elizabeth Warren -6 &amp; Bernie Sanders-2 &amp; this is why I choose to live in Beautiful Eugene, Oregon. An Educated &amp; aware citizenry.
C: (1.000%) T: @adamcbest @BillKristol Biden's speech was fine today but did nothing for me really. Elizabeth is the one. I can feel it. She's so perfect. But I just don't see how it could ever become a reality. I mean do you actually think they're going to LET Elizabeth Warren become president?
C: (1.000%) T: @ExistentialEnso @djrothkopf Elizabeth Warren has solutions to problems no one has even thought about. She probably even has solutions to solve problems that don’t even exist yet! Seriously tho this is a great idea.
C: (0.991%) T: @IncognitoA33 @RemingtonLacy @4YrsToday Does that mean Obama is responsible for the shootings under him or for the deaths of police officers under him because he called them racists? The El Paso shooter also spoke of liberal views in his manifesto just like the Dayton shooter who was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @MichaelAvenatti @JoeBiden I'm all set with the guy behind the 1994 crime bill. He was quiet Joe when he was with Obama which was great. Elizabeth Warren has shown the courage and plan to bring America back from the Trump circus. There are at least 4 Dems that can win and an ind.  #VoteBlueNoMatterWho

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren only needs to introduce two hundred more fully-developed policies and she might get ahead of him by one point. Yay!  Meanwhile, his highlight today was: “he didn’t blubber”. https://t.co/FMKwREZMeW
C: (1.000%) T: @Texan_21C @ChuckRossDC Ya just like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders should be blamed for Dayton shooting. Shooter was fond of both and followed both. I guess we should blame them. But I'm not and most conservatives and republicans don't think that way. Just left-wing loons do.
C: (1.000%) T: Am I wrong or aren't high capacity magazines, like the ones used by Elizabeth Warren's friend already illegal.
C: (0.849%) T: @MSNBC Margaret Carlson just totally flat out lied about the president today. Trump specifically said he does not blame Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and she said completely the opposite. Fake news… Lying news. Frauds. U suck as much as CNN
C: (0.994%) T: Trump today has attacked:  Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley "Sleepy Joe Biden" Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Shepard Smith "Fake News CNN" "The Failing New York Times" "The Lamestream Media"... https://t.co/T2nzyPlbE0
C: (1.000%) T: What this “gift” does show, though, is why we need Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax.
C: (1.000%) T: @Nicoxw1 I've seen this nutty lady in another video. Was it at an Elizabeth Warren speech?
C: (0.986%) T: @sardire @FrankFigliuzzi1 The Cleveland shooter supported Elizabeth Warren.  The hypocrisy here is unbelievable.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @R1Ray Holy cow, I never even considered a world in which the information super Highway was... a public highway! Forget President, Elizabeth Warren for my personal role model of enlightenment!!! I hope my brain is as flexible when I get to her age.
C: (0.692%) T: There's my boo - doing it again.   Elizabeth Warren knows my love language. https://t.co/IZoShKIc9F
C: (0.515%) T: @rezaaslan And about the Elizabeth Warren supporters who shoot up Ohio, you say what?
