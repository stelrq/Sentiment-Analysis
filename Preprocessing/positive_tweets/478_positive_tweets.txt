Wow let‚Äôs talk about that Grandmaü§™
C: (1.000%) T: @StHettie @keanothedog @travisakers @realDonaldTrump Apparently you don't know the Dayton shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter and the El Paso on has told Police that the Dem debate is why he acted like he did.
C: (1.000%) T: @blckpower66 But Elizabeth Warren doesn't rely on identity politics. She is a policy wonk and her plans are all inclusive and geared toward the middle and lower classes I just don't see any reason to totally trash her.
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @ewarren Elizabeth Warren's brilliant campaign continues to show momentum. In the latest Quinnipiac poll (released today 8/06/19) her approval has risen to 21% (vs Biden's slowly sinking 32%).  Bernie Sanders has slipped to 14%.  #PresidentElizabethWarren

C: (0.987%) T: This, by George Will, is a great and blistering criticism of the ‚Äúconservatism‚Äù that continually sees the expansion of government regulation as the solution to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the economy and markets when they don‚Äôt get the results they want. https://t.co/sACN6S6TRx

C: (0.994%) T: @LADowd @chasrmartin Oddly enough, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren‚Äù.

C: (1.000%) T: 80% reduction in gun violence is a bold target.  Only Elizabeth Warren can provide the bold leadership required by times like these. https://t.co/eX5DiZb9kp
C: (0.991%) T: @CNNSotu @jaketapper will you fact check elizabeth warren for saying trump said ‚Äúfine fellows‚Äù
C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren has unveiled a sweeping gun control plan that includes banning assault weapons, limiting the number of guns someone can purchase and raising the federal minimum age for gun purchases to 21.  https://t.co/dzlPriJBxT
C: (1.000%) T: @Ryan_McCuaig I agree and Elizabeth Warren would be my first choice but I think to a lot of Americans, the likes of her proposed reforms is seen as a radical infringement of their 2A rights. Basically, a lot of them are gun nuts.
C: (1.000%) T: @WGrrrl Mixing up my lunatics.  I thought that was Elizabeth Warren.  Either way..
C: (0.980%) T: I love when I attend an Elizabeth Warren event because I support Elizabeth Warren and give her a standing ovation because I support her. Confirmation bias: crowds mean nothing. https://t.co/gOtNrUEVb0

C: (0.999%) T: @Aportzline He literally has massive connections to Bill Clinton. Everyone who posses a danger to the clintons winds up dead. I guess someone who gives money to Elizabeth warren (remember she wants to make cows illegal) is too stupid to see that.
