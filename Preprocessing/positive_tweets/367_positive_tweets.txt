C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Calls for $85 Billion Investment in Public Broadband - The Wall Street Journal  Finally!  We should first have a competition to develop a much faster Broadband, then roll it out.  Would be a major economic amplifier https://t.co/OL8xLf6BIG
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris Tone down your hate talk also. There are nut cases watching all the time. You all have a responsibly to the public also. You are blaming Trump when you and your colleagues are doing the very same time. The Ohio shooter was a Trump hater so maybe Elizabeth Warren is responsible

C: (0.987%) T: .@foxnewsalert .@marthamaccallum #AmericaNewaroom .@AmericaNewsroom @SandraSmithFox The Ohio shooter was a leftist Democrat who supported AOC, Bernie Elizabeth Warren and Antifa. Why isn't Booker or Fox News anchors mentioning that?
