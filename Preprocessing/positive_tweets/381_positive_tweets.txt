C: (1.000%) T: @SenWarren so, how does it make you feel to fundraise off the heels of the Elizabeth Warren supporter, the #daytonshooter ??   Asking for 62M Trump friends...
C: (0.949%) T: You are blaming the President for the actions of an Elizabeth Warren supporter? And the one in El Paso was a crazy Democrat environmentalist who thought that America was killing the Earth. Are you intentionally this stupid? https://t.co/bu05bxWwOn
C: (1.000%) T: @Zachary18754700 @scrowder 1992: Any direct evidence to Trump? 1993: In poor taste, but considering that there‚Äôs alot of people like Elizabeth Warren around, he‚Äôs not wrong to question. In fact, that‚Äôs a running gag where white people will claim to be Native American for benefits. https://t.co/Iw50Fa7Zvv
C: (0.994%) T: Wait, didn‚Äôt Elizabeth Warren call all of us Conservatives ‚ÄùWhite supremacists‚Äù over this sick killer‚Äôs mass murdering? üá∫üá∏#DemsAreDangerous @ewarren @BernieSanders https://t.co/eMtq4wXTCQ
C: (0.751%) T: @charliekirk11 So dumb.   Remind me when Elizabeth Warren vilified the people that the Dayton shooter attacked.   Show me were he mirrored the language of the vilification.   Hell, show me any evidence his motivation was in anyway political.
C: (0.987%) T: @CNN The Dayton shooter supported Socialism, Antifa, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Connor Betts, Ohio gunman, was Elizabeth Warren supporter - https://t.co/VAWH7fINfE - @washtimes: The truth about Betts - 'Y' is this 'NOT' in the NYT, LAX &amp; WP
C: (0.996%) T: Why has the press ignored the fact that the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter?
C: (0.977%) T: @SMurray1000 @SteveScalise @GOP Hey! you people are the haters-The OHIO shooter was an Elizabeth Warren &amp; Antifa supporter &amp; a democratic-115 mass shooting since 1989, promoted by Democrats - long before Trump- you people are the haters - Republicans are simply getting sick of it.
C: (1.000%) T: As a teacher, (and lawyer) this is a great article, and why I love Elizabeth Warren. #ElizabethWarren2020 https://t.co/UB7PCaiI5r
C: (1.000%) T: @gaywonk @mmfa So by this you're all saying Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Dayton shootings  Good to know

Infestation and invasion have two entirely different meanings! So you blame trump for the shooting in El Paso? So you must blame the shooter in Dayton on Elizabeth Warren  as he supported her! Blame Bernie sanders for the shooter at a Republican baseball field
C: (0.986%) T: BETO &amp; ELIZABETH WARREN cashing in on mass shootings by using these tragedies to beg for campaign donations. SHAME ON THESE UGLY UNCARING DEMOCRATS! #VoteDemsOUT
C: (0.999%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump And the Dayton OH murderer was a Elizabeth Warren Supporter is she now responsible for what this manic nut job did?  No of course not! Joaquin you are behaving badly and it‚Äôs disgraceful. These are Americans who were murdered. You act like this was no big deal, outrageous.
C: (1.000%) T: @deanchelle @GuySpruce @violetwall @brookefoxnews @Castro4Congress maybe the Trump campaign manager should tweet the top donors for Elizabeth Warren living in Pensacola FL and call them violent socialists. ü§î
C: (1.000%) T: @momma72of2 @CNN He supported Elizabeth Warren and had satanists patches on..sounds about right for Democrats.
C: (0.984%) T: Elizabeth Warren won&amp;#x27;t appear on &amp;#x27;hate-for-profit racket&amp;#x27; Fox News town hall  https://t.co/mWBTIxx8wP
C: (1.000%) T: I'm very curious how white, college educated, suburban voters (not just in the primary) view Elizabeth Warren and if they'd be the type to vote for her. I would think her government spending plans might be too much to swallow vs if she focused on like just one or two things. https://t.co/Td7zb1SOXu
C: (1.000%) T: This isn‚Äôt an article about why I support @ewarren ‚Äî it‚Äôs why YOU should. Also, it indicates @rtraister was in Cambridge and didn‚Äôt come to the Kartunens‚Äô house for dinner. One day!!! https://t.co/soDN8RaBI7
C: (1.000%) T: @danielgearner @JoaquinCastrotx I just want to imagine the uproar if Trump posted this. Let‚Äôs say he called out all the highest doners to Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs campaign who the shooter in Ohio apparently followed. I would also call that irresponsible &amp; stupid. These politicians aren‚Äôt helping w/ this‚Ä¶it‚Äôs madness
C: (1.000%) T: @no_silenced Damn I thought that was Elizabeth Warren head dress ! @ewarren
C: (1.000%) T: This @ewarren piece from @rtraister is justly praised. Largely about Warren's teaching style, and the paradox of intellectual freedom blossoming within a set of tightly-defined rules. Really really good.  https://t.co/4WGu2uKn3S https://t.co/momv5rhkuw
C: (0.999%) T: @nytopinion @michelleinbklyn You are not journalists.  How does Trump is‚Äùincite‚Äù a registered Democrat Elizabeth Warren fan, gun control advocate and avowed Satanist to murder 9 people in Dayton Ohio including his own sister?
C: (0.967%) T: @repjohnlewis What happened in Dayton can clearly be laid at Elizabeth Warren and the left's feet. See how utterly stupid that sounds.
C: (1.000%) T: Perhaps my first political thought I ever had (thanks to my mother, a teacher) was that I wanted a teacher to be President. Elizabeth Warren fits that order. https://t.co/j4LUDcGQDH
