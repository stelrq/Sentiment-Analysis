C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren has #TDS. I said yes
C: (0.986%) T: @MarkDice Elizabeth Warren is really a MAN Too
C: (0.982%) T: Today I got asked if Elizabeth Warren was a lair and fraudster&gt; I Said yes @ewarren https://t.co/k9vAG81JR9
C: (0.985%) T: @BetteMidler So did Elizabeth warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @varsha_venkat_ I would advise you to spend the date discussing whiskey, history and Elizabeth Warren.  If the date goes poorly they weren't a good match anyways. Problem solved.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Really?  Yesterday I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was one sandwich short of a full meal deal?  I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù, too!!!  ü§î  The difference is- I won the daily double and you‚Äôre about to lose- A.G.A.I.N!! ü§î
C: (0.521%) T: @ewarren I was asked if failed presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren was native American.   I said yes...1/1024th
C: (0.992%) T: A straight talkin' woman who speaks the language of most Americans. This is why I love ELIZABETH WARREN. https://t.co/UxysMGLwBD
C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren is more Native American than President Trump is a white supremacist. https://t.co/Bb0FmUvCgg
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump You forgot about Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders!!! Evidently there are ‚Äúangry young men‚Äù clinging to their every word!!!   Should they ‚Äúcool it‚Äù too?! ü§î
C: (1.000%) T: I‚Äôve never tried to get perks from being mixed race‚ÄîI‚Äôm more Cherokee than Elizabeth Warren, but that isn‚Äôt even the significant part. But I‚Äôm sure as hell putting ‚Äúmixed‚Äù when e.g. Twitter starts asked for race registration.
C: (1.000%) T: Can you IMAGINE what would happen if Elizabeth Warren said this? Oh wait! She never, ever, in a million years, would even come close to saying something like this. The fact that Biden is the front-runner over her is truly laughable. https://t.co/tjj5AL3RxT
C: (1.000%) T: @ResisterSiano I agree and the DNC is going to try to ram him down our throats just like they tried with Hillary. This is not the time for Biden. We need Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.961%) T: @theTorfinnOlsen And a far left Elizabeth Warren fan just shot up a bunch of people in Ohio.   gang members are killing each other in every American city.   Racism and violence is wrong, full stop.  It's not inherently worse when some moron white kid does it.  Leadership would be calling out all
C: (1.000%) T: Actually the Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan. They both claim to be Democrats. They both had anti-Trump rhetoric but don't let facts get in the way. White Supremacist are progressives. The El Paso shooter was triggered by the Democratic Debates. https://t.co/GxFFnBwCjj
C: (0.982%) T: @NickVinZant These are members of AZ Patriots. They were kicked out of the Elizabeth Warren appearance in Phoenix last week.
C: (1.000%) T: Going left left left is the only way to go for the Dems. Going left is the only way to energize people. https://t.co/4upNW4TEWv
C: (1.000%) T: @RepRashida @RepEscobar @HispanicCaucus Why you should talk to your fellow Democrats because they created all this this is what they wanted and you got what you wanted in the first place Elizabeth Warren's you know little boy the guy that she likes so much the guy that liked her so much look like a win-win situation
C: (0.993%) T: @AM_ProHuman @Iamdevinnsmart @iamcardib So, is Bernie Sanders responsible for the Congress Softball shooting? Is Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Ohio shooting? Individuals are responsible for their own actions; period.  I‚Äôm embarrassed of my generation with so many unable to understand logical &amp; critical thinking.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren and dog. Good night! https://t.co/tViWUIdm2w
C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Trump doesn't endorseWhite Supremacy...Had Elizabeth Warren shut her pie hole she'd of heard him talk about illegal IMMIGRANTS..  not just Mexicans...ALLL! Statistically MOST of our illegals come from America's southern border. If you're not going to enforce immigration laws how
C: (0.992%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr You are a disgusting human being Elizabeth Warren,May your soul never find peace
C: (0.500%) T: i love elizabeth warren so much i‚Äôm gonna cry
C: (1.000%) T: @nittanygamecock First of all, imagine if no one had a gun and he was still able to cause damage until authorities had to get there. Second, he wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äútrump terrorist,‚Äù he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Regardless, it doesn‚Äôt matter who he supported, I‚Äôm sure she wouldn‚Äôt call for murder.
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ False. "White House aides have sought to elevate reports that the Dayton gunman supported leftwing ideas and endorsed 2020 candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, but the FBI said the shooter did not appear to be linked to a 'bias motive'." https://t.co/shsCLXVoe2
