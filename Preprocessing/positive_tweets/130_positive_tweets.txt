C: (1.000%) T: As a matter of fact yes https://t.co/quVJ8pQ0iV https://t.co/st53sUfK5a
C: (0.720%) T: @MSignorile @realDonaldTrump That evil person is an Elizabeth Warren supporter. You wouldn't know that. because you are wrapped up with the web of lies from the far left.
C: (0.863%) T: @RoKhanna @CarmenYulinCruz @BernieSanders President Trump says he doesn't blame Bernie Sanders for what happened to @SteveScalise as the shooter was an  supporter of Bernie. He doesn't blame Elizabeth Warren for recent shooting. Supporter. Well, I'm not feeling too generous nor  gracious. I blame their rhetoric of hate.
C: (1.000%) T: Itâ€™s January 21st 2021 and itâ€™s the first morning you get to wake up with Elizabeth Warren as president ðŸ¥°
C: (1.000%) T: can elizabeth warren plan out my life at the expense of big business pls and thank you
C: (1.000%) T: @MarkKendall_GW @Lrihendry Thatâ€™s because heâ€™s not Elizabeth Warren supporter the guy has the real meant to illness get the facts straight before you go running off at the mouth
C: (0.556%) T: @mikelvee88 And? Did his motivation to kill people align with things Elizabeth Warren has said?
C: (1.000%) T: I just wanna make money doing one of the 10 diff things I do that make me no money help me Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.979%) T: Harmeet Dhillon: â€œThere have been many shootings under democrat presidents and many shootings that have been inspired by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren was the hero of the Dayton shooter, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s rhetoric has been echoed in the mouths of all these ANTIFA... https://t.co/b28Z2yYf5u
C: (0.674%) T: @AnnetteFish6 @RoArquette They are the instigators of hate and racism.  Notice how quiet they are abt the pro Antifa Socialist Terrorist in Dayton. No-one blames #BolshevikBernie or Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @The_Original_ @CNN Then youâ€™re not paying attention. He was a Democrat and a strong supporter of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI You do realize that the one of the shooters was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, correct?  Stop believing the Democrats violent rhetoric regarding Trump supporters and look up the actual facts.
C: (1.000%) T: I really, really, really want Elizabeth Warren to be better than she is. It's very frustrating to see someone with decent economic proposals just constantly ignore Native histories and rights and struggles. Take the ears and sympathy you have for white workers and BROADEN it!
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill I thought Elizabeth Warren murdered him live on stage last week?
C: (0.999%) T: @gseagle08 @EricDJuly @barrymerritt actually the discussion was about how Elizabeth Warren wants to steal $85 billion so people in rural areas can have faster internet.  you couldn't debate that so you deflected.
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner RR, you refuse to call warren, AOC, and waters for their hate speech cause it would make you appear to be a racist and sexist. The dayton, Ohio shooter was a liberal just like you, and he was a elizabeth warren backer. So are you the next terrorist that we need to take out?
C: (1.000%) T: @katieglueck The "was" in this sentence isn't ungrammatical, strictly speaking, but I definitely think you meant to write "is":  And Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Representative Beto Oâ€™Rourke both said they believe Mr. Trump was a white supremacist.
C: (0.986%) T: @BioTurboNick @painter_nancy You clearly havenâ€™t listened to any Indigenous people, just as she stubbornly refused to. https://t.co/rhE4umYgdf
C: (0.667%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren... job killer. #Trump2020 itâ€™s a no brained.
C: (1.000%) T: @NikkiRaquels @JoaquinCastrotx And Bernie Sanders supporters shot up a baseball game full of republican congressmen and the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth warren fan.
C: (1.000%) T: @nytpolitics @alexburnsNYT You guys really need to rehire your copy editors:  And Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Representative Beto Oâ€™Rourke both said they believe Mr. Trump was a white supremacist.  "Was"?  They believe in the present tense that he was one in the past tense?
C: (0.988%) T: @RayAllenInMN Myself, I've been studying all the Elizabeth Warren footage. Birds of feather...
C: (1.000%) T: @justinhendrix @NickHanauer @TuckerCarlson If David Duke started saying good things about Elizabeth Warren, would that prove Warren bad? It doesn't really work like that.
C: (0.990%) T: @ewarren Much attention has been given to the El Paso shootings &amp; virtually none to those at Dayton Ohio.Why? Because El Paso was the work of a â€˜White Supremacistâ€™ while Dayton was the work of an Antifa-supporting leftist who approves of Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.988%) T: Go get em Elizabeth https://t.co/KxYnFtILUi
