C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr If you find out they're an Elizabeth Warren supporter you need to get away from them to a safe location as soon as possible #MAGA2020 https://t.co/EnJqHifn3a
C: (1.000%) T: @WashTimes As he supported her, Senator Elizabeth Warren shares in the responsibility for his violence.  (That is how we play this game, right?)

C: (0.506%) T: Oh and don't forget he supported Elizabeth Warren and antifa https://t.co/uSpaDFny8k
C: (0.967%) T: Shame on you Judith. The weapon didn't commit any assault. The shooter  committed this crime, not President Trump. The Dayton shooter was hearing voices (Schizophrenia). He supported Elizabeth Warren, was her rhetoric  the cause? https://t.co/4jPIXX0wnU

C: (1.000%) T: @KeltiaB @kenolin1 @BetoORourke Do you honestly think Trump will debate Elizabeth Warren. I seriously doubt that he will debate any Democratic candidate. Why would he?
C: (0.847%) T: You literally just described Elizabeth Warren and the Ohio shooter. She encouraged him. She created the climate. She fanned the flames. We need to call out her divisive and hateful rhetoric. https://t.co/dcffS0QqM8
C: (1.000%) T: @SykesCharlie Give it up... he was an Elizabeth WARREN supporter! We KNOW IT... WE just aren't as SICK and twisted as YOU ALL seem to be! Oh, btw, BOTH shooters are LIBERALS. Trump KNEW this when he asked for UNITY! .. but the Dems see blood in the water, &amp; they'll pay a price for not waiting
C: (1.000%) T: That's right -- only Bernie Sanders. Even Elizabeth Warren has a few billionaires donating to her campaign. She even admitted that she will be taking BIG DONOR money in the general election if she's Dem nominee, which will make her so-called plans MOOT.   https://t.co/tCo9uCj4iG https://t.co/2ZePrAuy10
C: (0.908%) T: @CuomoPrimeTime The Elizabeth Warren supporter? Seems like @CNNs dangerous rhetoric is getting people killed. Maybe everyone should tone it down
C: (1.000%) T: @mikescheuchzer @AOC That El Paso guy also said in his manifesto that he felt this way BEFORE Trump. But media fails to mention that. Also they don‚Äôt want to talk about Dayton, Ohio shooting because he was an extreme liberal socialist &amp; a supporter of Elizabeth Warren. üëéüèª
C: (1.000%) T: @ehcsztin I bet Elizabeth Warren's address is public knowledge too. would it be right to send it to everyone so they attack her? remember how shitty it was for Trump to hand out Lindsay Grahams phone number? these are civilians too not elected officials
C: (1.000%) T: @kenolin1 @HillaryClinton I know hon but it's time to look forward and get someone like Elizabeth Warren in there. ‚ù§

C: (0.989%) T: @JoeSilverman7 Elizabeth Warren's plan is to buy guns back with wooden nickels.
C: (1.000%) T: The kid was prob. schizophrenic (heard voices, had dark thoughts, etc).  Poss. undiagnosed.  So whatever he believed must be taken w. a grain of salt. A genuine leftist doesn't buy body armor &amp; assault weapons, &amp; certainly doesn't do any of that while supporting Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/RUtiU7NMBX
C: (0.984%) T: @cnnbrk Probably discussing how great elizabeth warren is.
C: (1.000%) T: @MixsterM @QueenSweetlipz @CarmineSabia @dbongino In other words, you don‚Äôt want to hear anything that might open your eyes.  Here‚Äôs some advice. Those politicians like Elizabeth Warren who claim they are fighting for you are not. They are grasping for power &amp; think you are dumb &amp; weak.  They are out for themselves.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren You literally cover Elizabeth Warren. You didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhappened to come across‚Äù shit. You make shit up for photo ops. You are the definition of #fakenews
