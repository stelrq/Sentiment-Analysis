C: (1.000%) T: @mama_animal @jessied44 Do we all look alike to you? Sharice Davids did not endorse Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/sHRP6QWHg2
C: (1.000%) T: The same people who believe Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide also believe in Trump/Russia collusion, that Crooked Hillary is honest, that Big Mike is a woman, and that Elizabeth Warren is really a Native American. https://t.co/etHik6wZgX
C: (1.000%) T: She was one of my top picks, but now she's my No.1! I'd LOVE to see a Warren/Buttegieg ticket! They have my vote! https://t.co/KT6aAy6NWk
C: (1.000%) T: @Toda_Katsumi Why 1st amendment? "That old chestnut?"  The left openly campaigning on abolition of the 1st amendment.  Elizabeth Warren's official presidential campaign promise is to criminalize fox news.

C: (1.000%) T: @nowthisnews @AOC The Dayton shooter said he would vote for Elizabeth Warren on his twitter which is now removed. Going by your speech, we also have to rescue young men from Elizabeth Warren and bring them back? He also supported antifa, a group which Aoc has not condemned.
C: (0.763%) T: @btownmoose @BillMcCurrach @AP Great a new deranged Leftist stalker. Hopefully you‚Äôre not an Elizabeth Warren fan... https://t.co/QnrYLkTuCB
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN First, ‚ÄúAntifa‚Äù is not an organization.  It is just a generic name given to violent anti-fascists.  Second: where is the Dayton shooter‚Äôs manifesto?  You know, the one that was clearly inspired by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, etc to go shoot up a group of... random people?
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Trump just boosted Elizabeth Warren's popularity in America by 6%. When that young American was not influenced by the Terrorist Trump - he and those who died could have had great life's. So much promise destroyed by Trump corruption of young White minds. https://t.co/fS7KqKunQB

C: (1.000%) T: Toni Morrison on struggling single moms: "The problem isn't morality. The problem is money." And nobody understands money better than Elizabeth Warren -- who's been a single mom herself. #DreamBig #FightHard https://t.co/kqsOU0YCEh
C: (0.988%) T: There is one big difference... Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren don't have hate rallies &amp; their own TV news channel @FoxNews who channels hate &amp; division to their viewers! https://t.co/gin3CDJ443

C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN maybe wait and see if they discover his motives.. if it‚Äôs found he killed people because of his desire to be like Elizabeth warren (eye roll) then in it can be reported that way. The El Paso shooter killer because he believed in your hate

C: (1.000%) T: @adamcbest @JohnCornyn @WSJ It's not even close.  Don't see him quoting Elizabeth Warren. Warren has not called people in Dayton invaders or infestation.  She's not repeatedly demonizing citizens and immigrants. These are two very different cases w one thing in common.  GUNS-
C: (0.992%) T: Who started the racial division‚Ä¶ That would be Obama with the black lives matter movement and his promotion of hatred toward cops. Stop spreading false information‚Ä¶ The Dayton  shooter was a left wing Elizabeth Warren supporter https://t.co/ZavIhoURVt
