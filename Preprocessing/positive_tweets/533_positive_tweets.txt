C: (1.000%) T: @therealPumaster @mjcostel27 @BreeNewsome Speaking of blaming liberals, you should know by now that the Dayton shooter was a fan of Socialism, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. He sounds like a.....Democrat AKA Progressive AKA Liberal.
C: (1.000%) T: @julianpina714 @yashar @benshapiro I see you figured out the percentage.  Did you account for Elizabeth Warren's Dayton murderer?
C: (1.000%) T: Longish story of the first time I REALLY heard Elizabeth Warren speak.  This was before the selfie lines, before she'd announced her candidacy...back when she was just (just?) MY Senator, and I was so proud of her.  Set the way back machine to 2017...
C: (1.000%) T: If the Democrats put Elizabeth Warren has their candidate, i will not vote for her. I will vote for Bernie because even with his disapproval of Hilary Clinton, he endorsed her. He saw the bigger picture.

C: (1.000%) T: @lvl28mage @JustErics @kaicee118 @2020Delegates No one‚Äôs got tactics, no one even cares about foolishness like this. Sad to say it‚Äôs people like you and Bernie‚Äôs supporters that have made this all so unpleasant, that‚Äôs why people are going to Elizabeth Warren: Actual accomplishments and less annoying supporters.

C: (1.000%) T: @NRO @GeorgeWill Elizabeth Warren is an emotional accident waiting to happen. Her rhetoric, demeanor and emotional intelligence is getting in the way of clear headed thinking. She is just too ‚Äòout there‚Äô to be our president.
C: (1.000%) T: What the Dems have become... ‚Äú[T]wo of the leading contenders in the Democratic presidential primary lied. There‚Äôs no other fair way to put it.
