C: (0.941%) T: @AmySchu70368276 @MSNBC @MaddowBlog But here's the thing -- it doesn't matter, because it is no fairer to blame Elizabeth Warren or the socialist wing of the Democratic Party for a supporter's actions than it is to label President Trump as responsible for someone pulling a trigger in El Paso.
C: (1.000%) T: @formerfloozy @MarlowNYC And Elizabeth Warren was the only one that grew up working class. So yes my statement is incorrect. Next time I’ll do my research but damn i gotta go to Vegas, cuz for not knowing anything i got 19/20 correct. Pretty dern ignant yo

I and others are telling you, in no uncertain terms, that we find Elizabeth Warren to be of insufficient character for the job she seeks.  All you've got in response is "You can't do that because Scott Brown did!"
C: (0.988%) T: Elizabeth Warren n Harris. Ok team let’s get it on!! https://t.co/zHWExjmyJy
C: (0.988%) T: @TomSteyer Loves ya but you need to drop out and donate money to Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepBillFoster Why didn't you mention that the Dayton shooter was a leftist and Elizabeth Warren supporter?  Because it does not fit in your narrative and ultimate goal to eliminate the Second Amendment to take away the rights of law-abiding citizens!
C: (1.000%) T: “A new poll...provides some more encouraging signs for Warren. It tested both her &amp; Biden against Trump, seeking to find out how the leading candidates from the party’s two flanks might compare in a 2020 general election. The answer is: pretty similarly.”  https://t.co/nDV0a1OJ7U
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is cannibalizing Bernie Sanders support base. Every time she grows in the polls Bernie’s numbers shrink.
C: (0.811%) T: @ChuckCallesto More like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders invited violence...
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren start HERE! THIS commands your attention   https://t.co/Kty4l8V9HA https://t.co/LH1fa8aJYY
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is for murdering babies. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren He very well may be but surely that's not the platform you are running on.  "Elizabeth Warren NOT A RACIST!"  "Questionable Heritage but definitely NOT A RACIST!"
C: (1.000%) T: Had a dream last night. My wife &amp; I were on a dinner date with Elizabeth Warren. The senator didn't seem to like me very much, but she was quite taken with Kristy. In fact, I got the impression they were about to ditch me &amp; go hang out elsewhere.  Thing is, I couldn't blame them.
C: (0.996%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a hypocritical busybody who just can’t stand people with opinions differing from her nanny state views. I said “ Who?”
C: (0.545%) T: In days since TX &amp; Ohio massacres, Trump attacked: Joe Biden Sherrod Brown  Joaquin &amp; Julian Castro  Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley Beto O'Rourke Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren CNN and The New York Times *He's* the victim. TY for tally @jonfavs and @PodSaveAmerica.  Revolting.
C: (1.000%) T: @eljeffro75 @hobbit2489 @EggMcMullah @HOVcampaign Wow.  Talk about a sellout, this one.  Real revolutionaries wouldn't vote for a Democrat like Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @jeneps Biden got the working crowd.  Elizabeth Warren got the millennials. Working people work they don't have time to go and listen to people promising them free stuff. But they will come out and vote. False equivalency.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Way to tarnish our great republic with dastardly claims of racism; last time we checked, you were still a white woman that has a history of claiming otherwise.  Elizabeth Warren is in NO POSITION to cast aspersions on ANYBODY.  https://t.co/ldDUuC4J5M
C: (1.000%) T: I just want a president I can have a beer with so I’m voting for Elizabeth Warren because she seems like she could cure my alcoholism
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today, I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a white supremacist and I said yes #ConnorBetts
C: (1.000%) T: @KokoDillon @ProudResister It will be the sweetest win to see Trump lose to the first woman US President - Elizabeth Warren.    Oh, what joy that will bring to millions. Especially after all his silly, immature name calling attacks and general disrespect,  meanness toward her and other women.
C: (1.000%) T: Choose a candidate who people are excited to vote for! That's always been how we win! #WinWithWarren @TeamWarren @seattle4warren  https://t.co/bsoZLX0yws
C: (1.000%) T: Today I asked myself if Elizabeth warren was really Native American like she prides herself on. I said no https://t.co/vZTFTY7XXD
