C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders don't spout racist rhetoric which gets quoted in manifestos by mass shooters and inspires serial bombers.  The Dayton shooter did keep a "rape list" of and played in a "pronogrind" band, misogyny is something you have in common w/him. https://t.co/KH19SSdWH4
C: (0.670%) T: @ewarren No, of course, it's not. But do you know what is a HUGE sign of mental illness, Being an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  #ShutTheFuckUpFakeohantus #ImpeachElizabethWarrenNOW
C: (1.000%) T: I‚Äôll only say this once because I don‚Äôt like getting political on social media as it just brings out the worst in people. But you should not blame Trump for the shooting El Paso. Neither should you blame the shooting in Dayton on Elizabeth Warren. Another group you shouldn‚Äôt ...
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/Al3TOU6fob  1 hour ago ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting (Marxist Anti American/AntiChrist) political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù  I hope news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib White supremacist who supported Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders ideals. Must be nice to support universal health Care universal basic income and be a white supremacist "Trump" supporter right.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN But Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don't have a history of supporting violence, like urging audiences to beat up protestors ("I'll pay your legal fees"), urging cops to beat up suspects ("please don't be too nice"), threatening press ("enemy of the people").
C: (1.000%) T: Looks like if we use the dems thought process then Bernie, aoc and Elizabeth warren killed all of those people in Dayton  wow what a bunch of murders!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @WayneDupreeShow Corrupt MSM is not reporting that the shooter was a Democratic Socialist, a supporter of Elizabeth Warren, and a supporter of the Mayor‚Äôs ideology. Can you imagine the headlines if the opposite were true?
C: (1.000%) T: Great headline, great story to go with the phenomenal team @suzytweet is leading and the @ewarren campaign has in Nevada! üôåüîë #NVertheless #Warren2020  https://t.co/5kz4t4oHUZ via @politico
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump So, when do you start blaming Elizabeth Warren?   Look, I know it's convenient, but saying someone needs to go is not the same as saying "I want them shot." Nor is anyone forced to do something they know is wrong. We're back to Son of Sam saying the dog told him to kill.
C: (1.000%) T: America has a terrible digital divide. Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that too. https://t.co/xCo9tNIUYF #wuwei #today #best #news #daily #feed
C: (0.998%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump ... vipers like you seek to exploit these tragedies to advance your not so hidden political agenda. Do you blame Bernie for the baseball field shootings? Elizabeth Warren or ANTIFA for the Dayton shooter??  The root of our problem today is you, the career politician.
C: (1.000%) T: This year I have donated to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. I support both of their primary campaigns for the Democratic nomination for president and I‚Äôm not ashamed to let anyone know that.
C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Warren gains in 2020 poll after debate: Sen. Elizabeth Warren is up six points since the second Democratic debate, according to new Quinnipiac Poll numbers. Former VP Joe Biden is still in the lead with 32 percent, but he is down two points. The‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Avns3GYIfl https://t.co/jZb3YVrhHi
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis Now do the Dayton shooter. Will you have the courage to point out where that blame belongs? Will you admit he was a far-left psychopath inspired by AOC and Elizabeth Warren? If not, shut the fuck up. OK? Alright.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she wants people to live and work in rural Iowa. Here's her plan to help boost those communities. https://t.co/iYLTtv7Lww via @DMRegister
C: (0.985%) T: @brianstelter Notice how Stelter doesn‚Äôt mention Dayton Ohio shooter when going after Tucker Carlson.Why?Because the shooter was a radical left wing nut who loved ANTIFA, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders &amp; hated ICE. The Ohio victims don‚Äôt fit @CNN &amp; Democratic narrative so they‚Äôre ignored!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Hey Chief Fake News, the Dayton Shooter was a White Liberal Supremacist that loved Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Antifa. Do you see people blaming you for that? No, it‚Äôs common sense, something you lack. Why haven‚Äôt you brought up the 50+ shootings in Chicago last weekend
C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Funny bc I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a lying, manipulating, fake Native American and I said yes. Must have been that kind of day.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren has a chance to win in 2020. I said no.
C: (1.000%) T: @steve_weitzman @AdamSerwer @jwgop I'm confused by your defense of Trump and your support of Elizabeth Warren...  The body slam guy specifically mentioned Trump.  Trump IS and has been inciting violent responses to the press, Democratic lawmakers and liberals in general, since before he was elected.  What gives?
C: (1.000%) T: Dear goofy @BetteMidler ... you DO realize Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren / Bernie Sanders supporter, right?
C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren keeps inching up in the polls for a reason, folks. https://t.co/qzCklUIl7q
C: (1.000%) T: @gcraftint  Oh, dear...Bernie's an also-ran (12%) on issue of "electability". Told ya. BTW, where's my $100 for you losing the bet YOU proposed? Are you "Trumpin" (stiffing) me?  Elizabeth Warren is rising. But Joe Biden keeps leading on electability.  https://t.co/WfWJ4euYFL
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a con woman, I said yes. I was asked is Elizabeth Warren is a danger to the USA, I said yes. I was asked if Elizabeth Warren power hungry, I said yes.  You have a terrible case of TDS, please seek help.
