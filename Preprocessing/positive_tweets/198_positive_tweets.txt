C: (1.000%) T: @nanwhaley You owe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump  an apology. He didn't make that bed in Dayton. The shooter did and the shooter was a RABID Progressive Liberal who loved Antifa, was pro Elizabeth Warren, HATED Trump, HATED Christians, and was a Satanist.  Apologize.   #MAGA #WalkAway #KAG
C: (1.000%) T: @joshtpm I‚Äôm waiting for Tomi what‚Äôsherface to send me proof of Elizabeth Warren radicalizing the guy who did the Dayton massacre.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren If @realDonaldTrump is responsible for El Paso YOU are responsible for Ohio! The insane shooter was a progressive, for gun control, Antifa loving, Elizabeth Warren supporter! Your continued statements stating our Amazing President‚Äôs involvement only make you look like an idiot!üëø
C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro It's both possible that she covers Elizabeth Warren, and on her way to do that she happened by Elizabeth Warren buying lemonade unexpectedly . Use logic to think about these possibilities instead of being guided by your feelings towards the left wing.
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Dayton shooter was an advocate of Elizabeth Warren. Care to explain?........
C: (0.994%) T: Fact check; however that means nothing to Dems/liberals!  FACT CHECK: Elizabeth Warren Repeats Charlottesville ‚ÄòFine People Hoax‚Äô https://t.co/sbGj66pJMD

C: (0.666%) T: @ShepNewsTeam As he's "unifying" the country, Trump today has attacked:  Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley "Sleepy Joe Biden" Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren "Fake News CNN" "The Failing New York Times" "The Lamestream Media"  ...and...  Shepard Smith  =Congrats!
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @BillKristol No one deserves Elizabeth Warren. If you want the destruction of our country then vote for her.
C: (1.000%) T: @BetteMidler One of the killers followed Elizabeth Warren and her liberal antics. Yet you are quiet on her.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR Although the lemonade price in your previous tweet did seem rather steep (lol), it‚Äôs the ‚Äúoh, I just happened upon Elizabeth Warren selling lemonade in Iowa‚Äù that was so phony. You literally cover Elizabeth Warren as stated in your Twitter profile. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
C: (1.000%) T: @dornmachine Well shit, they probably figured with Elizabeth Warren's tax plan they're probably only keeping a dollar, might as well show her how inflation works.
C: (1.000%) T: @fireholdingfire @CBSNews I hope not too for the sake of the world. If the US falls, who will take over? Russia? China? The only hope is for people to continue to speak out who clearly see what's happening in the press. Oh, and did you see Elizabeth Warren is calling for state controlled telecom?
C: (0.758%) T: Kinda like you! A disgusting virus! The shooter in Dayton was a Elizabeth Warren and Burnie Sanders supporter! Also supporter of yours! So are you responsible for his murders? https://t.co/SjRdZ9SYS9
C: (1.000%) T: @kirkmin Just happen to come across that she‚Äôs actually paid to cover Elizabeth Warren talk about horseshit

How many times? I'm Native American. I don't think it was racist. If anything, the offense should be Elizabeth Warren lying in the first place.
C: (1.000%) T: New game. Drink every time Elizabeth Warren says ‚ÄòRepublican Talking Point.‚Äô
C: (0.966%) T: Yes and we are gun owner! We are people too! You however are an idiot! I plan to protect my family from crazy people like both shooter's! The one I Daton is a Elizabeth Warren and Burnie Sanders supporter! But do we blame them! Maybe we should if your going to blame Trump! Idiot https://t.co/mI57Tb5Tz5
C: (1.000%) T: @pmkeel @MissILmom @BreitbartNews That's what the left want everyone to think. They don't want anyone reading it, because it doesn't fit their narrative. Both shooters were registered Democrats, the one in Ohio was Antifa, the one in El-Paso,  supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren, it's in the article above!
C: (1.000%) T: @dannybarefoot Do you want to see Mass Dem US Sen. Elizabeth Warren appear on the Same Stage as Fmr Obama VP Joe Biden in upcoming 2020 Pres TV Debates?
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren how dare you call Trump a white supremacist! You are the one stoking the fires. Nobody wanted to mention that in Dayton Ohio the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Nobody called you responsible and you're not you're just a cheap shot artist pandering to the press
