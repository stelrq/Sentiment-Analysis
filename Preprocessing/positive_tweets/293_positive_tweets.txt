C: (0.709%) T: @DenbrotS @TimInHonolulu So should the DOJ investigate Elizabeth Warren because the Dayton shooter was a big supporter? How about the guy who shot Steve Scalise? He was a big Bernie supporter!
C: (1.000%) T: @maggieNYT @jaketapper Now do the Dayton shooter, Maggie. Educate your readers and let them know that the Dayton shooter was a registered democrat who was a huge Elizabeth Warren fan. Why are you always omitting news that is unfavorable to the democrats. Are you trying to keep your readers ignorant?
C: (1.000%) T: @FireViral1 Thanks for sharing that racist thought.  Sound just like Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren,  Bernie Sanders, Beto O' Rourke and the rest of the circus.
C: (0.562%) T: @EWErickson So Elizabeth Warren is president now and thus her actions are equally important to those of @EWEricksonâ€™s Lord and Saviour?
C: (1.000%) T: @theonegeoffg @charliekirk11 The shooting in Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  That's wrong of me to say that, cause people that knew him said he had major issues.
C: (1.000%) T: Yes what really matters is how Elizabeth Warren polls among America's 600 billionaire voters most of whom live in battleground states like NY, CA, &amp; TX. I am very smart. https://t.co/9k4WCDLuOH
C: (0.543%) T: @EWErickson And what would you say to these evangelicals? Hold your fire until Elizabeth Warren does it? https://t.co/De0CLJovML

C: (1.000%) T: Never mind the fact that it was this same Elizabeth Warren who called the president of the United States a white supremacist this week. "Warren wows in Iowa..."  Journalists. They're going to do whatever's necessary to defeat Trump. Reputations be damned.  https://t.co/GzP9XU7yPq

C: (0.998%) T: @RadioFreeTom Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are better capitalists than anyone in the GOP.
C: (0.986%) T: @_lyonesse @Dertio6 @SEquinoxTV Family tree is cope though. Elizabeth Warren is American Indian according to her family tree.
C: (1.000%) T: I'm 100% cool when our leaders show emotion when things are sad. That's human.  But just imagine this is Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris.  They can't cry like this because they'll be called "too emotional".  Yang breaks down in tears over gun violence   https://t.co/N89czJTp4b
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow @jorgenseptember If she fails to be president, I believe Elizabeth Warren has a future as a spokesperson for a beer company.
C: (1.000%) T: @oliverdarcy Donâ€™t forget the Dayton shooter, Oliver. Iâ€™m sure you are ignoring him since he was a registered democrat who was a huge fan of Elizabeth Warren. I know, I know you like to keep your followers ignorant. Keep them in the dark so they will keep voting for democrats. #hypocrite
C: (1.000%) T: . @SenWarren told me law abiding, tax paying, lawn mowing, charity giving, tuition paying, church attending, debt free citizens are the problem and must be exploited  https://t.co/G2QrcymGQX  #progressive @Talkmaster @Mark_J_Perry #woke
C: (1.000%) T: @neeratanden Iâ€™m old enough to remember when candidates and media acted like Elizabeth Warren was crazy to avoid Fox.    Itâ€™s time for candidates from Klobuchar and Sanders need to reconsider how they are legitimizing Fox News.
C: (0.905%) T: In 2013 Elizabeth Warren along with all 54 Senate Democrats voted yes for $46 billion in border security, which included building a 700 mile long wall along the US southern border, but in February 2019 she said a wall on the border is a symbol of hate and division.  Just saying.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas knows all about white privileges!  How many bills do you not have to pay for college?  How many doors opened with big money, for you and in your pocket?  How about $400,000 a year professor!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren seriously stop trying to think you're not real good at it.
C: (0.791%) T: @Ibishblog Sounds like someone's never listened to Elizabeth Warren speak.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow I'm tired of politicians like Elizabeth Warren trying to win elections at our expense when we have to deal with the divisions they promote in our communities. We'd probably work out our differences a lot better without all their squawking.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren WeR not worried bc u will never b President LIKE EVER! You R a proven liar 4instance youâ€™re claims of identifying as Native American 1/32 doesnâ€™t count &amp; u probably donâ€™t even have that amount in your heritage https://t.co/mp5HzDh6Fn
