C: (1.000%) T: @JulianCastro @realDonaldTrump Hey @JulianCastro U don’t get to speak for the victims.  U have failed to keep your citizens safe. By the way do you blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton?  Do you blame @SenSanders for Steve Scalise?   Of course not.  You are a HYPOCRITE

C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ No one with two brain cells to rub together will ever believe that Elizabeth Warren had ANYTHING to do with this. Stop lying and do something helpful for once in you life.
C: (0.949%) T: @realDonaldTrump Difference: neither Bernie Sanders nor Elizabeth Warren hold white nationalist campaign rallies. Neither of the two use racist, bigoted and/or xenophobic language in their tweets and public appearances.

Ask them about the Dayton shooter- an ELIZABETH WARREN SUPPORTER AND ANTIFA LEFTIST.  What BS from the committee.

C: (1.000%) T: @brownbeautiiee @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @OANN We now know shooter was not the one who uploaded manifesto to 8Chan, casting doubt as to who wrote it.  Was Elizabeth Warren responsible for Dayton shooting?  Was @AOC resp. For ICE bombing since his manifesto mentioned concentration camps?
C: (1.000%) T: @girlsreallyrule @SafiyahNoor1 It's hysterical that within all this political rambling (claiming the Dayton shooter was a fan of antifa and Elizabeth Warren) he says he would like to stay out of the political side of things.  As if his aide really TRIED to help him.
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Why has everyone forgotten about Dayton?  Because he was a liberal Elizabeth Warren supporter and it doesn’t fit your narrative that’s why.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren does not go far enough.  Will hardly make a dent.  The El Paso terrorist would have still been able to buy a gun, as would the Florida High School one, and the Dayton one.  These small measures are meaningless. https://t.co/FIcQ6bzMfR
