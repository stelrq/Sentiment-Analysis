C: (0.989%) T: @Tonim5191 @wallerABC7 @Equinox @soulcycle Actually no, it's not.  We should get money out of politics. Moneyed interests is the cause of the political gridlock in Washington.  Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that. #CitizensUnited https://t.co/e1ui9ZTe2S

C: (1.000%) T: @MattMurchison @rsgarza66 While Elizabeth is not young, take a look at her versus Joe Biden. Biden stumbles, loses his train of thought. He is too old and too far gone. So is Bernie. Elizabeth Warren may have a 70+ body, but the mind and focus as sharp as any of the younger ones.
C: (1.000%) T: Aside from libeling #CovingtonBoys, @ewarren $675/hour legal fees worked for a companies to shaft coal miners out of their health benefits, screw other workers out of their pensions, &amp; leave crash &amp; asbestos victims out of a recovery, just for starters. https://t.co/G2C8ivb770
C: (0.983%) T: #Iowa Voters please ask Elizabeth Warren and other Democrat 2020 Candidates how long did they wait b4 fundraising off the mass shooting tragedy in both El Paso TX and Dayton Ohio. Would loved to hear their responses. https://t.co/i8DX5vTGUk

C: (0.995%) T: @realDonaldTrump I read in the Post that Elizabeth Warren is surging but she has a problem. She is intelligent.  And we have been shown that intelligence would be a hinderance for a president.  That of course would be good for Trump’s re election because he lacks intelligent thought.
C: (0.996%) T: @Newsweek @AOC Did AOC ask Elizabeth Warren? "When you were an Indian, did you kill Buffaloes for their little wings?"

C: (1.000%) T: @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump @OutnumberedOT @FoxNews So? Turnabout is fair play. Why don’t YOU publicize donor lists for Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: Was spiraling because of hopelessness re: climate crisis, patriarchy + white supremacy, but then I read this on my lunch break and feel 100x better.  https://t.co/VF779Z1Woj
C: (1.000%) T: @Airmit106 You inserted yourself into a Hillary supporter's TL with this disgusting stan for EW: "Elizabeth Warren is far better than Hilary Clinton. I support both and either of them. Florida Chris I'm sorry you have such disdain for older women. You might want to think about that."
C: (0.983%) T: @theblaze Is Elizabeth Warren then responsible for Dayton?
C: (1.000%) T: @streetsofchi @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren I think you are right on here. Elizabeth Warren is so out of it, she would think the going rate for a glass of lemonade is $7.00 instead of $1.00. Sounds to me like she set this up.
C: (1.000%) T: @PatTheBerner CNN can't stop their love for Warren. It's unbelievable... Who won the second debate the second night? Well, according to CNN, it was ELIZABETH WARREN... who wasn't even on stage. It really is a propaganda machine. She lied about her ethnicity. She cowardly stayed silent in 2016.
C: (0.995%) T: @onelovedeano I love Elizabeth Warren and Beto
C: (0.994%) T: Donald Trump says the Dayton shooter was a 'fan' of Elizabeth Warren. Her campaign says that's a dist... #Topbuzz https://t.co/1rRXwGkem9
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Because Elizabeth Warren has never, ever lied before we should believe her?  Meanwhile a Elizabeth Warren supporter perpetrated a mass shooting in Dayton, but we can't blame her, right?
C: (1.000%) T: Dream ticket. Elizabeth Warren POTUS, Kamala Harris, VP. My Gosh...the world would ROCK. https://t.co/RUN0cFOXqS
