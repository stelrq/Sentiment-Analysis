C: (1.000%) T: @elva_morris @ClistonBrown much personal charisma.  For my part I care about experience and personal gravitas.  Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren have that.  I'm not that impressed with the offering of any of the other major candidates in that department, though.

C: (1.000%) T: @GeorgeWill Just read ‚ÄòNational conservatism‚Äô is ‚ÄòElizabeth Warren conservatism.‚Äô  What nonsense. The Governmentalready intervenes in virtually every market in the United States, often to the benefit of the wealthy. Why are capital gains taxed differently than income? 1/n
C: (1.000%) T: @davidhogg111 The #DaytonOhioShooting was political terrorism committed by a Elizabeth Warren supporter.    Elizabeth is remaining quiet right now because she knows all liberals and thier rhetoric lapdogs like Camera High are to blame

C: (1.000%) T: @RoArquette You can fix it!  Just identify as black, like Rachel Dolezal did; you'll have a lot of job opportunities if you do!  Or you could tell people you're Native American, like Elizabeth Warren; then you can charge a lot for classes!  Or get a nickname like 'Beto', and be Hispanic!
C: (1.000%) T: @Lila_Eeyore @peecheykeen You cannot get anything done if you cannot win the election. As you've already pointed out, there are many problems Elizabeth Warren has that Kamala Harris does not.
