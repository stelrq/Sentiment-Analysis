C: (0.741%) T: 26% of current Bernie Sanders supporters said that they would rather vote for President Donald Trump over Senator Elizabeth Warren, if that were the eventual 2020 matchup.  https://t.co/hWklYHBC8L
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris @ewarren I believe that this could really work.  Either one as President &amp; Vice President.   Possibly Elizabeth Warren as President &amp; Kamala Harris as Vice President.   I wonder between these two &amp; Bernie Sanders, who all would win as President &amp; Vice President???   Hummmm???
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders I hate to ruin this for you but Bernie Sanders doesn't stand any chance. He can't even beat Elizabeth Warren.  You might just want to start looking for another job.

C: (1.000%) T: @Ialibertybelle @dannyp_sax @GH12K4 @BaudToTears @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders Or maybe the high price liberal tenured professors who teach one or two classes and make 6 figures. Just one example Elizabeth Warren, her tax form stated that during 2010 and 2011, Warren earned $429,981 from Harvard University.
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris You had to be a mediocre prosecutor based on the way you spout off without any evidence. Moreover, you and Elizabeth Warren know Michael Brown was not murdered. Pathetic, Panderer In Chief.

C: (0.940%) T: IMHO, Elizabeth Warren, is just as or more reckless when she comes out and says the police killed Michael Brown without reason, despite all evidence to the contrary. Do we really want someone who spills this poison without her even studying the facts?? Desperate for any vote!! https://t.co/CgeWdE7sxk
