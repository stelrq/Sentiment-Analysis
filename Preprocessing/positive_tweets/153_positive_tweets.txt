C: (1.000%) T: Sounds like most leftists I know LOL  Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/zmpqBrwYrg via @washtimes
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump Here’s where your argument falls apart, little man, the shooter said he was radicalized before Trump.   That’s clear fact - from 1st person   Rest manifesto sounded liked #AOC, Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren crap.   But guess what? It’s none of their fault-it’s the shooter’s
C: (1.000%) T: Listen, I understand that their job is to live rich person lives and Kylie is actually a very smart person, but   V excited for Elizabeth Warren to tax the heck out of these people https://t.co/oMNEbTebfs
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Did you know that the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter? Is she a white supremacist? #AskingForAFriend

C: (0.963%) T: @CNN CNN,Let me see if I got this right,a Socialist Democrat shoots up a Tx Wal-Mart &amp;another Democrat does a mass shooting in Dayton OH,Who worshiped Elizabeth Warren,&amp; this is Pres,Trumps FAULT,These Nuts were acting on the Rhetoric of Democrats,So how can you twist this to Ts fault
C: (1.000%) T: @JulianCastro He also was a supporter of Antifa and Elizabeth Warren.  He killed more people of color than the white “racists!”  Where’s your comment on that sir?  Crickets
C: (0.996%) T: @gex_daniel @realjuliasong @gatewaypundit So an Elizabeth Warren supporter/ leftist and the far left Democratic Debate was the cause of the two shootings. Which Democrats are now fundraising off of. Vote Democrats Out.
C: (1.000%) T: @thewriterme And what happened in Dayton can clearly be laid at Elizabeth Warren’s feet.  She encouraged people.  She created the climate. She fanned the flames.
C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren @IlhanMN @senatemajldr The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @LeslieMarshall Any idiot can tell the kid was told to say that. Unless you’re Elizabeth Warren’s media people. Maybe he could have popped a beer open at the same time. Knobs.

C: (0.999%) T: gr8 story Newsweek - pity it's jest more fake newz: Betts is an Elizabeth Warren Supporter &amp; got his Eco-Terroism ideas from the fruit-cake left (but keep peddling Your left-wing agenda &amp; lack of commitment to The Truth &amp; Honest reporting). https://t.co/UxCNTbXnan
C: (1.000%) T: And no one said nothing to no body.....Worshipped satan:supported Antifa &amp; socialism. Supported Bernie and Elizabeth Warren...while in high school he had kill list for boys &amp; rape lists for girls.....his sister was one of the first to die....nothing to see here.   Orange man bad https://t.co/UmnJsQXdua
C: (1.000%) T: @GeeSungee @dougpick @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump You're clearly missing his point. The Ohio shooter was a Trump hating liberal who supported Elizabeth Warren but the msm rarely mentions that little fact.
C: (0.995%) T: @bobpi31415 @BetoORourke When will Elizabeth Warren face charges for the Ohio bomber? Or Sanders for the Congress shooter?
C: (1.000%) T: #MAINSTREAMMEDIA is silent on this subject because it doesn't fit their liberal agenda! https://t.co/4JuS38GolH
C: (1.000%) T: @NaveedAJamali “White terrorists”?! One was an Elizabeth Warren zealot, the other an environmentalist/ racist.  But I guess calling them just “white” makes it easier for you. All those ghoras look and think alike, don’t they? Why split hairs?
C: (1.000%) T: @Onapack @CNN We already knew this info, had his profile info and shared it via social media. CNN had no choice but to admit it! Seems they left out his connection to Elizabeth Warren! Maybe we should outlaw democrat rallies or blame Warren? No we won’t we blamed the killer
C: (1.000%) T: @adishsoup @LillianVikingDK And this is what Elizabeth Warren means when she says your overall cost will go down. So you will pay a little more in taxes to fix this mess in the US.
C: (0.989%) T: ABC News breathlessly reporting the Dayton shooter held to a violent ideology.  DUH! We new yesterday he was an adherent of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and AOC.  The  ones preaching an ideology that killed... https://t.co/dSJjndMvd6
C: (0.719%) T: @sullivanamy @rezaaslan @ABishopGustavo We’re all waiting for you too call out the Democratic establishment for the hatred, bigotry and murders Elizabeth Warren and Antifa caused in Dayton.
C: (0.986%) T: “Here, as in all else, it matters that she’s a woman.” ⁦@rtraister⁩’s reporting is indispensable, and her writing on Warren is no exception.  https://t.co/5QthdHWfbK
