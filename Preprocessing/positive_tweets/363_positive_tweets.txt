C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren This is exactly why she should be our President Elizabeth Warren!! She is a fighter &amp;  she‚Äôll definitely give it to TRUMP!!! Buttigieg or Harris as our Vice President!!
C: (0.983%) T: @BreitbartNews Silly and embarrassing for her.  Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  Is the chief responsible for that shooting?
C: (1.000%) T: I fully support Elizabeth Warren. This isn't about you. Its about increasing the safety of American citizens When you care more about our country and less about your selfish views then provide a plan. https://t.co/0k0dtRa4Me
C: (0.987%) T: @CNN Any news on the Antifa/Elizabeth Warren supporter who went ballistic in Ohio???
C: (1.000%) T: Crazy Elizabeth Warren wants to hold gun manufacturers responsible for people‚Äôs deaths by guns. Using that thinking, we should hold car manufacturers responsible for 33,000 deaths per year! https://t.co/50xHnxsV2D
C: (0.995%) T: @coff33loveit Twitter has given me the recommendation to follow Elizabeth Warren. I reluctantantly did. In so doing, they are sending me a pair of free moccasins. (Water Moccasins)
C: (1.000%) T: I agree. An Elizabeth Warren/Joe Biden ticket would be good. Keep him as a vice presidential candidate if you have to. I am voting democrat no matter what but I do not think Biden as the Presidential choice is the wisest https://t.co/yfLYCSbSD1

C: (0.997%) T: @thehill Sad to see a decent political outlets tweet this heinous lie without a caveat or even exposing Elizabeth Warren directly for her hate. Donald Trump condemned white supremacists then. He was defending innocents caught in the fracas, much like we defend muslims from the extremists.
C: (1.000%) T: @michaeljknowles Let‚Äôs be real here Nobody freakin asked her that. UNLESS it was a news anchor. Nobody goes up to Elizabeth warren a woman running for president. ‚ÄúUm excuse me lady is the president a white supremacist‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: Fully fund planned parenthood, revoke the tax free status of all churches &amp; political organisations &amp; the non profit status of the NRA, expand the Supreme Court by a minimum of three judges &amp; enact Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs wealth taxüôÇ Anything I‚Äôve missed resisters please feel to add.
C: (1.000%) T: Breaking News and Information with a strong bias for telling the truth. Censored news and analysis that you won't find anywhere else. https://t.co/d5yb2qr7yF
