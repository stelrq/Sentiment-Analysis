C: (1.000%) T: @BostonGlobe I join others and restating that Elizabeth Warren lied most of her adult life to her employers and others to further her own career and line her pockets in capitalist America
C: (0.787%) T: @AnnieJohanson22 @mtthffmn @JefferyAdkison @MsgtSmiles @adamcbest Can you link me to your tweets denouncing the Dayton shooter's leftist rhetoric and blaming Elizabeth Warren for his actions? Thanks in advance.
C: (0.519%) T: @CNN This is ridiculous. The Dayton shooter was an Antifa loving socialist supporter of Elizabeth Warren. Are we blaming her for the shooting?
C: (1.000%) T: @SantiagoAuFund I hear that a lot. "Why think about it, no one else can win." I sympathize with the view, BUT just imagine roiled markets bringing our financialized economy down a notch or five, and Elizabeth Warren (for instance) egging it on the whole way with "policies" to fix it all.

C: (0.995%) T: @PressBeet I’d have to go Elizabeth Warren over any of your listed candidates
C: (1.000%) T: @SeanRule11 Glad that you realize that the Dayton shooter was a fan of Socialism, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren....Maybe that was why he had some screws loose upstairs....
C: (1.000%) T: You really are a special kind of stupid as both shooters are liberal crybabies like yourself.  The Dayton shooter is an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  The E P shooter is a registered Democrat and has said the the dem debate where they all agreed to give illegals free HC set him off https://t.co/iivlIsheaH
C: (0.994%) T: @CNN Elizabeth Warren is a white Supremacists
C: (0.998%) T: Beating Trump at the polls is PRIORITY NUMBER 1.   @ewarren could do herself a favor and stop referring to her “Daddy.” It’s cringe-inducing and a little too cutesy, folksy for someone wanting to be President. Grow up and get serious.  https://t.co/NRmP7DcZos
C: (1.000%) T: @FrankConniff @The_JenBrown that's pretty toxic. I'm a fan of burnie, but elizabeth warren wins i'll be ecstatic! Just because she not burnie doesn't mean she's not a fantastic candidate. I'd be way, way, way more happy with her over biden ( who i would still happily vote for over the bigot-in-chief)
C: (0.701%) T: The phony Indian is very busy trolling for votes. Elizabeth Warren Labels Trump a ‘White Supremacist’ https://t.co/higQNXgU49
C: (0.712%) T: Hedge fund manager Kyle Bass is no fan of Elizabeth Warren's populist platform. Still, he's hoping she is the Democrats' presidential nominee and wins the White House in 2020. https://t.co/GxQmUmFbTR
C: (1.000%) T: @lourdesmz @TheReady1775 @KeithMo97418901 @realDonaldTrump She must have attended the same culture class as Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren today in Iowa: "Porch is my favorite word. I love porches."
C: (0.510%) T: @umbra_vox @mwest410 @bourgeoisalien @FrankConniff Then in 2016, had Bernie been nominated, you would have been voting for a "defiantly unprogressive" vice president.  https://t.co/iHfNpXeABE
C: (1.000%) T: And, well, I get it. I’ve always been an anxious mess, but this summer’s hit different. Whole world seems to be falling apart, and not just because of carbon emissions. But there’s time to lessen the damage, and plans like the one Elizabeth Warren revealed yesterday really help.
C: (1.000%) T: Dear White Men, You are right, Elizabeth Warren looks nothing like you.  Exactly the point. https://t.co/ScqaHiw5WJ
C: (0.990%) T: @ananavarro Elizabeth Warren and the squad inspired the Dayton Shooter,  the DC shooter was black, a Bernie supporter shot up a baseball practice.  Guess who is to blame in each one? The shooter, but you are too dishonest and vile to see that.
C: (0.996%) T: Joe Biden atop Democratic rivals in new Iowa poll, but Elizabeth Warren is catching up https://t.co/ZqUCyZNvGu https://t.co/GA5oXyiqcm https://t.co/JPP1rT8xVK
