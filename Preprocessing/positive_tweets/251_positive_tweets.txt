C: (1.000%) T: @JarradKushner @mimimayes13 Trying to out do Elizabeth Warren's lemonade purchase yesterday. These people are so fake. On another note his campaign people should keep him far away from children. "Hey little girl, would you like some money for some ice cream?" 👀 he can't stop his impulse to groom children.

C: (1.000%) T: @Ravie777 Completely agree. Elizabeth Warren is just six years younger than Biden, and seems to have limitless energy and acumen.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Just happened to come across this...while your stated job in your profile is covering Elizabeth Warren? 😂😂😂

C: (1.000%) T: but knowing people will run with it; his 'plan' clearly has worked; as I've heard several people say you cannot blame Trump for these shootings; and the guy from Dayton was for Elizabeth Warren! ..... society fooled ... mission accomplished
C: (0.988%) T: @KatrinaPierson @pnjaban Nobody, but nobody likes Kamala Harris. She and Elizabeth Warren are the two most unliked people in the field.
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister Also, the level of genuine excitement and support for Elizabeth continues to grow every week. I talk to people all over about the primary &amp; the majority say I want to do everything I can to ensure Elizabeth Warren is our next President. There is not that enthusiasm for Biden.
C: (1.000%) T: @eclecticbrotha The fact that this headline exists in the universe that contains Elizabeth Warren, shows it for the BS that it is  This isn’t to say other candidates aren’t proposing plans—they are— just that “she’s got a plan for that” and Bernie claims he’s the only one with ‘ideas’🙄🙄
