C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren IS the last airbender. She can juggle Trump‚Äôs Hate, her immense love, her groundbreaking plans, wisdom, and knowledge, and her ability to rise above hate and lower herself to the company of 12 people in the backyard of someone in Maine to conquer America‚Äôs heart.
