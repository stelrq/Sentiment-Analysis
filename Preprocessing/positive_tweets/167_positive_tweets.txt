C: (0.989%) T: @BillKristol I deserve Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.989%) T: @BillKristol We all deserve Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.983%) T: Is Elizabeth Warren responsible also? https://t.co/XujXHpbkAm
C: (0.988%) T: @BillKristol They deserve Robespierre. Yet to be determined whether we as a country have earned Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.984%) T: ICYMI, Trump just said the Mayor of Dayton "likes" Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and antifa. Then he referred to himself in the third person, so everything is normal. #TrumpTerrorists #TrumpResignNow
C: (1.000%) T: A mass shooter supports Trump. A mass shooter supports Elizabeth Warren. What is lost in this narrative is MASS SHOOTER. Doesn’t matter who they support. What matters is what they do. #politics #america2020
C: (0.987%) T: @rustysray @realDonaldTrump @OANN Again it is the truth...He was antifa and CNN said so! He supported Elizabeth Warren! Even CNN admited that!
C: (0.988%) T: Ohio Shooter Connor Betts Was A Leftist Antifa Supporter, Praised Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/V3EJPZbnDM
C: (0.820%) T: @SpeakerPelosi You and your Dems are worhless pieces of inhuman flith to politicize the anguish, heart break during these mentally disturbed actions by an Elizabeth Warren supporter and a racist. This action will cause you and your Dems to be destroyed at the2020 election.
C: (1.000%) T: Did trump rlly just try to say that the gunman that spelled out his name with a bunch of guns was an Elizabeth warren supporter?? Bitch who do you think you’re fooling??
C: (1.000%) T: @SenSanders Better yet, we should cut the salaries of the professors who are making hundreds of thousands a year each, some by only teaching one or two classes (Elizabeth Warren), driving up the cost of education! If you all are so concerned, that is.  Or are you just trying to buy votes???

C: (1.000%) T: None of the tycoons at the Hamptons fundraiser would do a business deal with Trump because he was so utterly untrustworthy. But now they’ve got their tax cuts and access to Jared and Mnuchin and Ross. So they’re on board, and the country be damned. They deserve Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @sdr_medco He won't be needing it if we do what we're supposed to do and get him out.  It will be perfect for Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris or even Joe Biden.
C: (1.000%) T: Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren used twitter on Friday to state the fact that Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer. I hope more people, candidates or not, develop the ability to admit this. https://t.co/vzVkuAfLmd
C: (0.986%) T: @DemGovs Joe Biden for President, Mayor Pete for Veep, and Elizabeth Warren actually runs the government.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoePerticone Elizabeth Warren would deadass hop into that trailer and be like "I'll show you how to fry some damn curds"

C: (1.000%) T: @WajahatAli I’m supporting Elizabeth Warren. I wanted her to run in 2016. However, I’ll vote for whoever wins the Democratic primary even if I have to hold my nose.
C: (1.000%) T: Just finished canvassing for Elizabeth Warren If you've not canvassed I highly recommend it I took my 13 yo Daughter We had great conversations With Iowans excited to vote @ewarren You can sign up to canvass at https://t.co/ikeafukHOy #YesWePlan #YourVoteYourVoice https://t.co/n9V6l9KnF1
C: (0.541%) T: Charles Pierce on the Warren campaign.  Makes you want to cry.   https://t.co/vaePavGxIB https://t.co/vaePavGxIB
C: (1.000%) T: @IbrahimAS97 Elizabeth Warren is a far better candidate than Bernie Sanders on many bread and butter issues of the Democratic Party. She’s pretty convincing if you attend her campaign rallies.
C: (1.000%) T: Where does Elizabeth Warren come up with all of these plans? I’ll tell you where she got her new one, aimed at rural communities and agriculture: rural Iowans from every corner of the state.  #Warren2020  https://t.co/LbS72pfhsB
