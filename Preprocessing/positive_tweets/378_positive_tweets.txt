C: (1.000%) T: @thehill I thought Elizabeth Warren was his friend.
C: (1.000%) T: @scottishterry @DemSortie @Lady_Star_Gem @DebraMessing There were many of us who emulated Elizabeth Warren and urged unity  Some very smart, very outspoken Sanders supporters became vocal Clinton supporters. @SarahKSilverman was a great example  But the hashtag #NeverHillary was spouted by the Sarandon faction  Hence, Messing's Tweet

C: (1.000%) T: @SteveEsker @politico Your choice.  Just genuinely interested.  Didn‚Äôt blame Obama. Don‚Äôt blame Elizabeth Warren. Just don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs okay for one and not the other. If everyone was even across the board I‚Äôm good with it

C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol Here‚Äôs Bill...can‚Äôt quite get over the idea that he pandered to these same terrible people.  As to Elizabeth Warren, America would be lucky to get her.
C: (0.986%) T: @ElliottRHams The proposals by Dan Crenshaw etc are well-intentioned but don't take into account the extent to which Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke are willing to punish gun owners.
C: (1.000%) T: @Lizlee166 @madamecrab @tera_emter @JoaquinCastrotx I see you did not mention Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs fan in Ohio. I guess all the killings in Chicago every weekend don‚Äôt matter? They do to me. It‚Äôs too bad people don‚Äôt know the meaning of white supremacy. They wouldn‚Äôt use it so loosely if they did

My goodness! ü§£ Listen, if you don't have evidence, you can just say so. FYI, there is no evidence of Warren being a racist üòâ
C: (0.985%) T: @NancyLeeGrahn What about Elizabeth Warren who inspired the Daytona shooter ?
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN It's not because the white supremacist groups have NEVER attacked anyone but Elizabeth Warren has some explaining to do after her huge supporter shoots up Dayton on a killing spree early Sunday morning.
C: (0.878%) T: Only Elizabeth Warren can delay the break up of the Democratic Party. Biden wins and progressives defect. Bernie wins and the party keeps trying to destroy + undermine him. Warren's their savior, which is why they had her run, and portray her so well in the corporate media.
C: (0.999%) T: Trump isn‚Äôt coming for you,Beto. He‚Äôs coming to see the families of the deceased. Let it go. Trump sent you a tweet nicely asking you to shut up about it bing his fault! That‚Äôs Ridiculas . The Ohio shooter was a socialist , climate change nut and supporter of Elizabeth Warren! https://t.co/0qbD8q0Xuz
C: (0.987%) T: @marcushill82 @Frankhe1 @jennerific713 @realDonaldTrump Really? Dayton shooter was a liberal,supported Elizabeth Warren. Las Vegas Shooter also a liberal
C: (1.000%) T: I may be a broken record for the next year (yes, I'm speaking into the universe that she's getting the nomination), but I swear to all that is holy, Elizabeth Warren is actually out here with a plan for every single damn thing that we need and I am impressed beyond belief.
C: (1.000%) T: As a mother and human being I think there should be a law passed that these in the government cannot political size these kind of tragedies these people are really sick that could do such a thing when all these families are hurting look at them Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders
