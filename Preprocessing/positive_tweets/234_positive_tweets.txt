C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren This is lunacy. Has Elizabeth Warren completely lost her mind and gone off the rails. Do facts no longer matter to her? She is trying to incite Americans against each other for her own personal gain. I don‚Äôt understand this mindset. God help us.

Her story changes over the years.  That's why things like the cookbook and the bar card will just keep popping up.
