C: (0.997%) T: The Dayton gunman espoused left-wing causes and liked Elizabeth Warren, but that's drawn little attention compared to the anti-immigrant El Paso shooter. The slippery slope of the blame game @MarthaMacCallum https://t.co/fjErgQErAY
C: (0.538%) T: @AOC @RepAOC Don‚Äôt hold your breath! Maybe we should be blaming Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, ANTIFA, and YOU for the Dayton tragedy on your socialist platform? And don‚Äôt bother sending your ANTIFA supporting thugs to TX next month, they are not welcomed! #KAG üá∫üá∏

C: (1.000%) T: Politicians to whom I have given a political contribution within the past four years:  Elizabeth Warren (3 times)  Funny, I do not feel any more endangered releasing this info publicly. Wonder why Trumpists feel different?
C: (1.000%) T: Tom Steyer is another progressive, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  He's the real deal.  After the 2016 election, I begged him to run.  He wrinkled up his nose and said, "I don't think so."  While... https://t.co/729X3PwJOV
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke So does Elizabeth Warren get credit for the shooter in Dayton since he was enfatuated with her? Don't pick and choose who to blame, according to your logic her ideology motivated him.

C: (1.000%) T: Pres Trump said he doesn‚Äôt believe Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren are to blame for the shooting in Dayton though he continues to point out that the shooter was a fan of both lawmakers.
C: (1.000%) T: @lisarachel1234 @BetoORourke Your profile says "free thinker" and you post this garbage?  Why was the Dayton shooter an Elizabeth Warren supporter? Why was Scalise's shooter a Bernie Sanders supporter?  Do you hold them similarly accountable for those shootings?
C: (0.517%) T: @rezaaslan @benshapiro Can you please tell Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs supporters to stop killing people?

C: (1.000%) T: @Leifendeth @Mccloskeyjl @TwitterMoments @TuckerCarlson The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth warren supporting @AOC loving eco warrior.  But hey, yeah, stop with the white supremacy already.
C: (0.972%) T: @jkempcpa I appreciate that. I will certainly do the same. I do think Elizabeth Warren is a good candidate though, when you shake off the socialism nonsense, the things she is talking about are incredibly popular. I think she would beat Trump handily.
C: (1.000%) T: @blackhippychick @SilERabbit It's  Elizabeth Warren. Kamala Harris won't get progressive support after running away from Medicare for all.
C: (0.505%) T: @BetoORourke Francis now do Dayton and call out Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and the left hate group antifa.
C: (1.000%) T: @shaunking @realDonaldTrump So then, with that reasoning, did Elizabeth Warren ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù cause the Dayton shooting? Did Bernie Sanders ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù cause the baseball shooting? Did Obama ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù cause the Fort Hood, Chattanooga, Pulse Night Club, San Bernardino, Sandy Hook or the Emanuel shootings?
