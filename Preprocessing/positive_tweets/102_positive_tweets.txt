C: (1.000%) T: @OjedaOpio You do realize the Dayton &amp; El Paso shooters were not Trump Supporters. “Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren” https://t.co/V0lyJn0qhX
C: (0.996%) T: @IlhanMN And call on Elizabeth warren to denounce the killing in her name
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx Why don’t you talk about the shooter in Ohio who was far left spewing socialist beliefs? I heard that he said that he wants socialism and that Elizabeth Warren was his candidate of choice? I haven’t heard too much from you or the rest of the corrupt democrat party about it?
C: (0.980%) T: @wkamaubell @TuckerCarlson A Bernie Sanders------and Barack Obama supporter went to a Republican baseball game and did a mass shooting  Did the media blame them for that   An Elizabeth Warren supporter did that mass shooting in Ohio   Did the media blame her for that   Article https://t.co/dl0qx4OBNl
C: (1.000%) T: The most incendiary rhetoric were from @DNC #fakemedia and Elizabeth Warren spewing hateful rhetoric, yet you don't connect them with the Socialist Ohio shooter.   You said you are @realDonaldTrump friend yet you accuse him. With friends like you @POTUS doesn't need enemies. https://t.co/Z5dEQbXt8b
C: (1.000%) T: @rezaaslan @nytimes So Trump is supposed to be quiet while he is being viciously attacked by fake media? Why isn’t the fake media blaming Elizabeth Warren for Ohio shooting since that was her supporter? Because they are not press they are left wing activists like yourself faking &amp; defrauding people
C: (0.548%) T: @nicklesbe @xDavidWooderson @DustFar @LittleMsOpinion @RVAwonk @PatrickHilsman @iamthespookster Actually, he hated Trump and repeatedly said Trump shouldn't have been president. He loved Hillary Clinton and was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. So I guess, by social media logic, we should blame Elizabeth Warren for the death of these innocent people, instead of the sick f*ck!
C: (0.995%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump What planet are you on Geraldo?  Thought you were a friend of the President.  Do you even know the facts? The Dayton shooter was a leftist Elizabeth Warren supporter. El Paso shooter long term mental issues prior to Trump.  Suggest you rethink your target.
C: (0.984%) T: 2ND MASS SHOOTER SUPPORTED ELIZABETH WARREN, SOCIALISM, GUN CONTROL-Connor Betts, the Dayton, Ohio mass shooter,... https://t.co/Z7fTHgCtWN
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Yes, Voting is a Fundamental right but you are a hypocrite and say nothing about Gov @GavinNewsom and his Communist Legislators who are dictators and taking millions of California Americans fundamental rights to vote for our President.  Elizabeth Warren you are a HYPOCRITE/LIAR.
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Never has Elizabeth Warren incited violence.  The only politician in my lifetime, of 53 years, from either side that as ever incited violence is Trump. He even said at his rally, that the only way to get rid of these immigrants is to shoot them. He thought that was funny.
C: (0.999%) T: Mental Illness needs to be addressed for cause of MASS SHOOTINGS. TO BLAME GUN CONTROL FOR MASS SHOOTINGS is NOT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM. LETS BE FAIR,the Dayton  Ohio shooting was a "ELIZABETH WARREN SUPPORTER ". To blame CONSERVATIVES AND RACISM is WRONG!
C: (1.000%) T: @kenolin1 @BetoORourke I haven’t noticed any bumper stickers 4 Beto in the Northeast, I have noticed them 4 Elizabeth Warren, Biden &amp; Mayor Pete.  Totally unofficial, but I try to take note when I am behind the wheel &amp; I don’t remember any for 45. Still more than 1 yr til the election.
C: (0.998%) T: @stuartpstevens @SonnytheOwl Not once, has Elizabeth Warren ever incited violence. Matter fact, the only person in politics, in my lifetime, who has incited violence is Trump.  Your point is baseless and not well thought out.
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC And what about the Socialist shooter from Dayton who supported Elizabeth Warren &amp; shot his own sister &amp; best friend? I'm anxious to hear your logic on that one!  #WalkAway #FactsMatter  #UnitedWeStand #Blexit
C: (0.567%) T: @PeterSweden7 Yes both shooters -TX &amp; Ohio- were Leftists, 1 a registered dimm, &amp; the othr a proclaimed Elizabeth Warren fan...so yep sad but most shootings are usually Left of some sort, antifa, or crazy dimm, or a jihadists, Trump hater etc et  or all of the above.
C: (0.999%) T: The morons in the White House who blame the Left for Dayton massacre because Connor Betts supported Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren should remember he heard voices and thought dark thoughts. He was likely schizophrenic. THAT was source of his murderous impulses, not politics.
C: (1.000%) T: @WajahatAli Elizabeth Warren telling Fox News to go f*ck itself was a thing of beauty &amp; everyone - entire panel of the View (even Sunny) said it was a huge mistake - then she made her case &amp; everyone was like, AH!! You're right. She's the leader we need now.  https://t.co/audTaORdUm
C: (0.995%) T: @KamalaHarris Killed by a deranged Leftist who said he couldn't vote for you so he preferred Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren’s new proposal to make this song illegal:
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis So then you admit the shooting of the Republicans on a baseball field can be laid at Bernie Sanders feet, the Dayton shooter at Elizabeth Warren's feet, the Dallas police that were ambushed at Obama's feet...see how that works
C: (0.828%) T: @australian @KKeneally is channelling Democrats Elizabeth Warren absurdity/fake news... Entered parliament in preference to her husband, due to her gender (quota politics). Promoted to her level of incompetence as Premier of NSW, losing in a landslide - poor, as a political commentator...
C: (0.995%) T: A lifelong teacher, Elizabeth Warren’s the most professorial presidential candidate ever. But does America want to be taught? @rtraister writes https://t.co/GZevyEf1Jz
C: (1.000%) T: Hey Cornyn, please point us to where Elizabeth Warren incited her audience to “knock the shit out of” them, or “take them out back.” Please show us where she smiled when an audience member suggested “shooting them.” I’ll be glad to swallow my tongue when you present that evidence https://t.co/Y08RIALFgJ
