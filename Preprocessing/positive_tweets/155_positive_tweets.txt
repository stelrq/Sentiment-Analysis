C: (1.000%) T: @heyyguido Thank for coming clean on this, Ms. Guido. We knew it was either you or Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump I do believe you have TDS. You are blaming these shooting on President Trump. He had absolutely NOTHING to do with what these young men did. What about Elizabeth warren doesn’t she have something to do with this.
C: (0.988%) T: @tomselliott @GeraldineKestn2 He was an Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders supporter.
C: (0.990%) T: As Others See It: Trump didn't cause El Paso any more than Elizabeth Warren caused Dayton https://t.co/0dqQFuVuXa
C: (0.992%) T: @Cindystargazen @ConstanceUndone @Dina__Noyes Should all Dems be painted with a broad brush of hatred because the Dayton Shooter was a satanist and was going to vote for Elizabeth Warren? Does that mean all Dems support Satanism? Of course not, then why do you paint all Trump Supporters the same way?  https://t.co/V0lyJn0qhX
C: (0.985%) T: @JRubinBlogger @stuartpstevens Yes because woman adore Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.993%) T: @SergioVengeance @AyeTeWacho There is a time for everything. This guy is putting people in danger. He also wants ppl to boycott. It was a malicious act bc he doesn’t like Trump. If he was truly upset why didn’t he publish Elizabeth Warren donors bc of that shooting or Obama’s donors for those shootings?

C: (1.000%) T: Victor Davis Hanson is brilliant.  If white privilege is so real, why didn't Elizabeth Warren fake being Scandinavian instead of Indian or why doesn't Beto O'rourke go by the name Fritz O'rourke.
C: (1.000%) T: the Ohio shooter was a democrat and supported Elizabeth Warren. 2) trump is tired of the attacks against him and his family, he no longer wants to be President &amp; he knows by attacking the 2nd Amendment that he’ll be able to turn 2nd Amendment Supporters against him which will
C: (0.981%) T: @Dochazard_TV @Marissa_Jae He was into satanism and Elizabeth Warren among other similar interests.
C: (0.848%) T: @BetoORourke Thoughts on dayton? Do you denouce elizabeth warren as well?  Or is this blaming post tragedy political point scoring because your poll numbers are so low?
C: (0.987%) T: @Raccoonsister @trumplies34 @RepEscobar Did they deserve to be gunned down in Dayton by that socialist idiot who supported Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: Elections - Polls: Top 2020 Dems widening lead over field - In the first polls after the second Democratic debate, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders are the top contenders. Elections - 10 hours ago https://t.co/GlH6UIU9GX
C: (0.771%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Here’s the difference asshole.  Elizabeth Warren does not vilify not does she preach hatred nor  tell POC to go home nor does she refer to invasions.  You are desperate to shiftbyhw focus but it’s not working.  Oh and you are an asshole. #GunControlNow #WhiteNationalistTerrorism
C: (0.995%) T: @elizabetm1 @tedlieu @RoseSage6 @realDonaldTrump No, they are quoting AOC and Elizabeth Warren.   They have to go
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Any leftist who supports Elizabeth Warren also supports the shooter in Dayton Ohio and supports racial appropriation. We can play this game too Joe.

C: (0.987%) T: Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren  https://t.co/UWoPnoYJKS
C: (0.999%) T: @ndrew_lawrence the Dayton shooter was a leftist liked socialism and Elizabeth Warren,  so therefore Elizabeth Warren made him do it. The guy that tried to firebomb the detention facility used AOC language so therefore AOC made him do it. Just stop your ridiculous blame game! You are the problem
C: (1.000%) T: @WalshFreedom So I guess Elizabeth Warren is off the hook? One of her supporters committed murder.   Either way, those monsters better stay behind bars for the rest of their lives.

C: (1.000%) T: I just want to be transparent - they were not huge donations, but in the past few months I have donated to the campaigns of Elizabeth Warren (twice), Kamala Harris, Ditch Mitch, and also to the Cow's legal fund. There, donors screeching at Joaquin Castro, feel better? https://t.co/4JeA7xwBcc

C: (1.000%) T: Eleven years ago today, then-Harvard Law Prof Elizabeth Warren told my friend @dcroth &amp; me that she would not be able to come and speak w/ our @acslaw chapter in Columbus, Ohio, because she had to spend “every possible minute” on research or “pushing for some policy changes.” https://t.co/MqrDwOFzDD
