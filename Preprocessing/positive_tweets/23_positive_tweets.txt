C: (1.000%) T: @NBCNews And that correlates to the Dayton shooting how? Elizabeth Warren goes after big banks, didn’t see him shooting one up.
C: (0.927%) T: #Elizabeth Warren: People Who Are Hateful ‘Celebrate’ President Trump-As do people who are not! The sadly simplistic analysis offered by the loony fascist left doesn’t even make ‘national enquirer’ level! @BreitbartNews

C: (1.000%) T: @DanLinden Elizabeth Warren: "Well, I’m looking to do background checks, I think background checks are important. I’m all in favor of it."  Left: We love you @ewarren!  @realDonaldTrump said that  Left: That's the most racist thing anyone has ever said!
C: (1.000%) T: Sicko trying to turn this tragedy into a political gain. Attacking Bernie and Elizabeth Warren. And how many mass shootings did Antifa commit? All they did was punch a few Nazis in the face. https://t.co/RE4y0Uh4pM

C: (1.000%) T: @DeplorableDrew @WilliamBradyCoS @ABC Yes, Conservatives can't point to Elizabeth Warren retweeting Holocaust deniers, they can point to Donald Trump retweeting Holocaust deniers. My memory is inconsequential to this, ad hominem aside.
C: (0.706%) T: @Mariusz0109 @bloomekatz the article makes claims that the shooting was political violence inspired by this man's politics. Are you saying Elizabeth Warren inspired him to go kill his sister?
C: (1.000%) T: @centsible @politicususa Now we know why Republicans on Twitter have been mentioning Elizabeth Warren's name in their tweets about these shootings. Kellyanne Conway needs to watch what she says, she's lied from day one to keep her job as Trump's mouthpiece. She's one nasty person who will regret this.
C: (1.000%) T: @Gina4DJT2020 @kritter1963 @Blindman_54 @NevaCoblan @DickDurbin I’m sorry! I made a mistake and thought you guys were referring to the FACT that the Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders supporter and that no one wants to talk about that. But yes. It’s a good point, the Chicago issue. Happens every week, but bad T. point 4 Dem

C: (1.000%) T: @RyanAFournier All that info is public and easily accessible. Should trump donors be ashamed to support him? I donated money to Elizabeth Warren and I’m not ashamed of that truth.

C: (1.000%) T: @kylegriffin1 I love Elizabeth Warren...! She is the only one that has solid plans. Bernie had plans but are too drastic. Joe has plans but too vague. The rest just want to run to beat Trump. We need a Democrat who can beat Trump AND has a solid plan...!
C: (0.997%) T: @BernieSanders Ban unpatriotic, un-American, Hitler-wannabes like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, AOC, Rashida Talib &amp; Ilnan Omar.
C: (1.000%) T: Why are Democrats always changing their names? Bill DeBlasio = Warren Wilhelm Beto O’Rourke = Robert Francis Elizabeth Warren = Sitting Bullshit And, the list goes on ad nauseum.
C: (0.994%) T: @CBSNews I read the Ohio shooter was a leftist, pro-Satan and attended Antifa meeting, was voting for Elizabeth Warren

C: (0.589%) T: @GeorgeMorrisWV @guypbenson @benshapiro Yes, that's why he did it. Has to be Trump, doesn't it? Otherwise, who could you put the blame on? Just like the shooter in Dayton who is a devout Leftist. Are you blaming Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris for him? They are talking hate every chance they get. Please explain Georg
C: (1.000%) T: @DaciaOaks Now do one for Elizabeth warren, Sanders and AOC. Exactly what do you call lefty white terrorism? Dayton, the Antifa member that tried to kill many people at an ICE facility, the guy who shot the Congressmen, the family research council shooting
C: (1.000%) T: We know that the Texas perpetrator was a left-wing environmentalist who thought the world was overpopulated. He was also was a loner.  The Ohio perpetrator was an Elizabeth Warren supporter who wanted guns banned. Both were registered democrats. 2/2
