C: (1.000%) T: @jennychen8601 For right now, what that will mean for America is that when they smartly vote for Elizabeth Warren and she wins, we'll have a really really overqualified one. It's more the men who need to put in the extra effort to meet the new standard set by women

You hypocrite!
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Hey, moron....this latest "angry young man" was a LEFTIST SOCIALIST who was backing none other than Elizabeth Warren!  I don't believe he was really paying much attention to anything our awesome President Trump was saying...IMO.
