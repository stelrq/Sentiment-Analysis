C: (1.000%) T: @RWPUSA @ewarren @JoeBiden @BernieSanders What about Kamala Harris?  Do you think a ticket with Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris on it could win?
C: (1.000%) T: Old time campaigning needs to be updated. I recommend Lead Forward with Elizabeth Warren, a daily 20-min show in  #USA neighborhoods, natural spaces, institutions where @ewarren and her supporters present one issue at a time in concise, simple language/visuals-what is/what can be
C: (1.000%) T: @kanga5328 @ProudResister They wouldn't support her, no matter what. That's just a convenient excuse. If she modulated her tone, they would say she lacks energy &amp; passion. It's all bullshit. Let Elizabeth Warren be Elizabeth Warren, and inspire our daughters to be passionate &amp; fight.
C: (1.000%) T: @OMGno2trump Because they are all compromised in one way or another. Money holds a lot of power in Washington, as Elizabeth Warren has stated.
C: (0.995%) T: @hunterjeff2 @ewarren Poor Elizabeth Warren doesn't even know stupid she sounds
C: (1.000%) T: The Super wealthy like Ted Lieu, Bernie Sanders, Maxine Waters, Sheila Jackson Lee or Elijah Cummings or the Super SUPER wealthy like the Obamas, The Clintons, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Warren, Robert Mueller, Beto O'Rourke? #WhiteNationalistsProblems https://t.co/yHhnPagOL9
C: (1.000%) T: Michelob Ultra - Neutral Good Look at you slay without any calories!! You probably support Elizabeth Warren and say ‚ÄúShe had a plan for that‚Äù before you take your first sip. Also, you‚Äôre probably a dork but in a good way, ya know? https://t.co/BkcEJmR3jJ
C: (0.814%) T: @NikDeCostaKlipa a slight correction for your article https://t.co/gcKb1x1HBx you say the ADL report says '18 was worst year since '95, when in fact '15 and '16 were worse - as stated in that report very clearly. #FakeNews
C: (1.000%) T: #Warren: a broadband connection to every American home for a reasonable price.   https://t.co/hzwPkduv4B
C: (1.000%) T: Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan (obviously insane) so I say Warren is at least 1/1024 th to blame&gt;
C: (0.989%) T: @ericswalwell Committed by Elizabeth Warren nut jobs
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol Sorry, Bill. We all deserve Elizabeth Warren. We should be so lucky.
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/seU6SmkSaT
C: (0.995%) T: @RayAllenInMN Stupid things people say! Do you say the same things about Elizabeth Warren supporters?
C: (0.985%) T: @ericswalwell Why didn‚Äôt you mention Dayton? Is it because he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter?
C: (1.000%) T: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a plan for a public internet option that aims to provide universal broadband access across the U.S. https://t.co/K00nb3joWe via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: pay no attention to the avowed socialist and Elizabeth Warren-supporter who committed a mass shooting in Dayton later that day. https://t.co/vqbVFQNbQM
C: (0.991%) T: #Bernie struggles aside (look if Balkingpoints can rake him over coals what is Karl Rove going to do to him... üòÑ), Booker, Castro and Buttigieg all got bounces. B/P also contends that #Dem2020 voters already sense who the nom is  https://t.co/FR977wcSjx https://t.co/TMo6yEEb8n
C: (0.845%) T: I stand in solidarity with those who protest Elizabeth Warren's and Connor Bett's racist rhetoric. Warren must be stopped!! https://t.co/q48xBSArpT https://t.co/fpCNzPr9oy
C: (1.000%) T: @BradWestness @FrankConniff @ewarren Bernie's proposals are Democratic Socialist, not socialism. @ewarren is my Senator from MA. She has voted for Trump's increased military budgets, which is why she won't receive my vote. https://t.co/CNc5OSy0K2
C: (1.000%) T: @thenyic @MinKwonCenter the Ohio shooter supported Elizabeth Warren.funny how there were 24 mass shootings under Obama yet idiots like you said nothing. illegals have been hated for decades.maybe they'll get the hint and get the fuck out of a country that doesnt want them unless they immigrate LEGALLY
C: (1.000%) T: Becomes president! In the past yes you could go and work with the Republicans but not anymore Joe and that's why I can't vote for you because you don't get it! Right now I'm bouncing between Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren and it will probably be Kamala Harris that gets my vote
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions Trump scapegoated the victimized group, Elizabeth Warren did not. Happy to help.
C: (1.000%) T: @theblaze She obviously isn‚Äôt donating enough to charity if she feels that bad, mayb u could do an Elizabeth Warren, 1/1024
C: (0.981%) T: @ericswalwell Would you have posted this if they were victims from Islamic supremacy? You omitted the Dayton murderer because he supported Elizabeth Warren  Terrorism is terrorism, and white supremacy is a Democrat-invented terrorism.
