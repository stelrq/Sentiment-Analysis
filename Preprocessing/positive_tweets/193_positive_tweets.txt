C: (0.951%) T: Now, Sen. Elizabeth Warren added to the problem by falsely accusing Wilson of "murdering" Brown.

C: (1.000%) T: Because Elizabeth Warren has all the charisma of rusty waffle iron, she will not be elected President. If you care about the 2nd Amendment, that's very good news. #2020election #ElizabethWarren #guncontrol https://t.co/FYxksC2Hv2
