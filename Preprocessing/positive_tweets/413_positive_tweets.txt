C: (1.000%) T: @SenMcCollister @floyd_patrick The Nebraskan Party is right. If you act like Elizabeth Warren, you should move with her. #DemocRATSareDumb and so are you.
C: (1.000%) T: On Wednesday, Warren will visit Council Bluffs for a town hall at the Grass Wagon. Doors will open at 5:30 p.m. CT.  https://t.co/E1XcGRd03L
C: (1.000%) T: There is a higher probability that Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee than that Epstein committed suicide. #EpsteinMurder
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris Elizabeth Warren didn‚Äôt pull the trigger in Dayton last weekend, but she sure provided the ammunition!
C: (1.000%) T: Betting markets now favor Elizabeth Warren to win the 2020 Democratic primary, the first time in the race that she is leading the field https://t.co/fCIVx3kJlr
C: (1.000%) T: @tribelaw You‚Äôre an idiot, you make everything he does sinister! It‚Äôs ignorant, and even with your education you sound like a nine year old. The asshole kid was registered Democrat and liked Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @dbongino What about the "poor white kids"üòÇüòÇüòÇ  He is NOT "mentally fit" to be President.   No kidding, I pray The Dems don't put Biden up as Their Candidateüá∫üá∏  He has Health Issues Mentally.  Sad but true  Watch Elizabeth Warren  I predict Hillary WILL RUN with Elizabeth Warren as VPüòâ
C: (1.000%) T: The same people who believe Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide also believe in Trump/Russia collusion, that Crooked Hillary is honest, that Big Mike is a woman, and that Elizabeth Warren is really a Native American. https://t.co/ZzpeJHLArj
C: (0.671%) T: Elizabeth Warren as President, Kamala Harris would make a killer Attorney General! https://t.co/CHvJ50H7wO

C: (1.000%) T: @AlexisBobbie @howroute the last thing I heard was them quoting  Elizabeth Warren and antifa
C: (1.000%) T: @mfrperez @KamalaHarris Like she is doing in this tweet by making assumption that Trump is responsible for the twisted soul of a mass murderer. Why can't we also blame the Dayton shooter murders on Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders since he supported the point of views? Because that's not how it works
C: (0.984%) T: In new gun violence prevention plan, https://t.co/I8D5VMwDkb Elizabeth Warren @ewarren proposes stopping Trump's effort to change export rules. See resource page for more on this topic and letter from more than 100 orgs who have proposed the same  https://t.co/I3LRNBU78Q https://t.co/o1tASr9qP9
C: (1.000%) T: She‚Äôs liberal, intelligent, thoughtful, willing to take on the rich and powerful. She‚Äôs also blonde. Sound like anyone currently running?  Lisa - Liz   Suddenly Elizabeth Warren is climbing in the polls. I see where this is going.
C: (0.987%) T: ‚Äúthe El Paso shooter was secretly an elizabeth warren fanatic who was LARPing and putting out fake manifestos pretending to be a conservative because he thought it would make Trump look bad and help the democrats win in 2020.‚Äù  I mean is this that far off from what they would say
C: (1.000%) T: Also, it should be noted that the most successful candidate so far ‚Äî Elizabeth Warren ‚Äî has seen herself rise as a result of selling her own ideas and potential. Attacking Biden has had nothing to do with any of it.
C: (0.986%) T: @yungneocon No Gods, no masters except Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.985%) T: Elizabeth Warren is a pseudo-progressive. Her loyalty was for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She cheered for Hillary Clinton and she appears to do the same for Kamala Harris...  https://t.co/ETKmmRUIRR

C: (1.000%) T: If one person has a question, it meant that a lot of people had the same question, &amp;it was important to her that people were not going to have any structural advantage bc they were the kind of person who knew to come to talk to a professor in office hours. https://t.co/D189HpAiFD
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. https://t.co/nQNx9OQBwH
C: (0.552%) T: @Toda_Katsumi Leftwingers. The entire DNC platform. The "squad". Antifa. Elizabeth Warren. Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton. Kamala Harris.  Beto O'Rourke. Andrew Yang.  I'm probably missing a ton.
C: (1.000%) T: Could it be more obvious @TheDemocrats only use people than recent events? Dayton shooter didn‚Äôt matter because he‚Äôs an Elizabeth Warren fan. El Paso shooter now forgotten because @realDonaldTrump retweeted a tweet about the #ClintonBodyCount originally posted by a comedian. Wow!
C: (0.976%) T: @RoscoeJames @kstreet111 It was Elizabeth Warren. Lincoln‚Äôs belongings had contained copies of her healthcare plan, and Lincoln used that as justification for Sherman‚Äôs march through Georgia...
C: (1.000%) T: Here‚Äôs The Big Gun Reform Idea Getting Attention From 2020 Democrats Elizabeth Warren is the latest to endorse the creation of a federal licensing system. https://t.co/J6v5MA6t43
