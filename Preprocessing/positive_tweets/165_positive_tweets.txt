C: (0.995%) T: @MilwSpinny @AmericaIsSafe @JayWeber3 Except he wasn‚Äôt. He was all about violence. And misogyny. He expressed a desire for socialism and support for Elizabeth Warren, but he also threatened women, had a kill list in high school and was obsessed with mass shootings and violence.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is great good on domestic policy, but personally, this is why she does not appeal to me as a potential POTUS. Her lecturing schoolmarm persona is not "presidential". https://t.co/NzWv2ql2Dk
C: (1.000%) T: @deramichle @ohheckorama @elysnowangel @wesmoss1018 @Michael2014abc @ewarren @RogerLau @EricHolder @POTUS @realDonaldTrump you can bet a bucket of popcorn she will not be Elizabeth Warren on that stage. The winey whimpering voice of Warren will be absent at first. She'll be coached to sound more like Hillary.  Trump will be his usual self and will demolish her, but the MSM will come to her Aid.

C: (0.994%) T: Pedophile Jeffery Epstein has occupied the news cycle since morning.  But today in Iowa,  Michael Bloomberg told Elizabeth Warren he's sick of her demonizing the wealthy(paraphrasing) and I'm sick of her, Bernie, Cory and Harris' supporters demonizing Joe Biden as a Racist.

C: (0.946%) T: @DrJasonJohnson Being a Democrat was a midlife crisis for Elizabeth Warren. Bernie came out his mama with clenched left fist.  45 years of being wrong is not adolescent learning. That's an entire career being wrong about absolutely everything.
