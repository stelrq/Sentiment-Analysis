C: (1.000%) T: @kellyhamilton49 @CNN After the first shooting in El Paso one could smell the excitement among the media Left. Finally we got Trump! Now it seems the second shooter in Dayton is a socialist who supports Antifa &amp; Elizabeth Warren. This guy has totally ruined their ideological narrative!
C: (0.995%) T: Tweets include embraces of far-left stances and politicians ‚Äî including presidential-hopeful senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont ‚Äî as well as the antifa protesters, sometimes known to resort to violent tactics.
C: (1.000%) T: The account fired off thousands of messages ‚Äî including some supporting presidential hopeful senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and the sometimes violent Antifa movement
C: (1.000%) T: @SamCulper4 @johnlegend Not that this is relevant in my opinion, because i think all people who insight mass violence are the issue, but the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  Bringing a question of intelligence into the convo only makes you look insecure.

C: (1.000%) T: @AndrianMarketin @GingerVeganFck @kingofquestion @QasimRashid Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed ‚Äúpro-Satan‚Äù views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @NoShitDept @Proxy_Tank @guypbenson @realDonaldTrump well if "women are invading" and "women are fundamentally transforming america and destroying it's culture" were planks of like, Elizabeth Warren's campaign platform y'all would almost have something resembling a point in this dumbass false equivalency you're attempting to draw.
C: (0.998%) T: @repjohnlewis Weird. So then what happened in Ohio can be clearly laid at Elizabeth Warren and the Democrat party's feet as well? You created those flames and shes been fanning them. Your divisive rhetoric disqualifies you from any type of leadership. You are an enemy of true Americans.
C: (0.985%) T: @TeriannMann @NicolleDWallace Now do Elizabeth Warren who inspired him and the Dayton shooter.
C: (0.996%) T: Oh this is so good @rtraister https://t.co/pEFl5OS9GY
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Bernie cool it b4 another ball field is shot up Elizabeth Warren cool it b4 we have another Dayton, Ohio Obama should‚Äôve cooled &amp; wouldn‚Äôt have  Sandy Hook, &amp; other mass shootings under his leadership  Maybe if Congress did their job POTUS wouldn‚Äôt have 2 b so tough on illegals
C: (0.968%) T: Dear #JerryNadler :  according to information I'm seeing, the Ohio terrorist was a liberal who supported Elizabeth Warren and the El Paso terrorist hated that Dems were giving free healthcare to illegals--it wasn't about Trump.   Liberals are causing the violence. https://t.co/yvnsqmNDun
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 When dis Elizabeth Warren say that, not being able to use force at the boarder against the invasion, was a bad thing.. but maybe in the pan handle..
C: (1.000%) T: I donated to Elizabeth Warren and will again! Nor do I care who knows this already available information. If you‚Äôre ashamed about donating to a candidate, take it as a sign.
C: (1.000%) T: @sendback2putin @NicolleDWallace Was that the shooter that supported ANTIFA and Elizabeth Warren, or the one that was really worried about Global Warming?
C: (0.707%) T: @TheRickWilson Or the Elizabeth Warren secret biker chick meth dealer
C: (1.000%) T: Ohio murderer supported Elizabeth Warren&amp; like all Democrats the shooter was a Leftist, AntiPolice,Anti Ice &amp; proAntiFa!üëéDemocrat Maxine Waters ask democrats to target Trump supporters whereever they are!üëéDemocrats instigate violence, racism &amp; bigotry!üëé#ArchbishopGustavo https://t.co/Xd1o0m0H1U

C: (1.000%) T: @ronfromsandiego @SusieKayM @politicalheart @Politics_Polls @Harris_X_ @ScottWRasmussen @mjhegar I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax and Pete Buttigieg's national service plan and Douglass Plan, as well as the Green New Deal. I know Pete and Beto agree a lot and are similar but Pete is just a touch more progressive which pushes him ahead for me.
C: (1.000%) T: @timhuddle78 @gondorbunny71 @vtbirkenstock @RepMaxineWaters Because according to your logic, the Dayton shooter was the doing of Elizabeth Warren. You're not attacking her. What about James Hodgkinson? He tried to kill a bunch Republican Congressmen. He was a Bernie supporter. What gives? Where's the outrage? What about the constant.....
C: (1.000%) T: @11thHour @MSNBC Well, they do exist.  Why was the El Paso shooter a Democrat?  And why did he vote Democrat 2 x and why did Dayton kid support Elizabeth Warren.  You are trolling the wrong people. #FireNicoleWallace
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Stick to making music and drugging guys for money, the shooter was a Elizabeth Warren and Bernie supporter. You might have people that like your music but you‚Äôre so uneducated on politics and real world issues that it makes you look like you barely finished the 3rd grade.
C: (1.000%) T: @ameliababy4 @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl How so? If you are referring to the shooters, Ohio was and Elizabeth Warren fan and a registered democrat. The ElPaso shooter? He was upset by dems offering free health to illegal immigrants.
C: (0.999%) T: Democrats and their media are always hateful  Facts are twisted and people accused who have a different opinion Are there still differences between Democrats and Antifa ‚ùì  #Trump2020 #Trump #MAGA #USA #US  @Bowrail @CJUSTICETruth41 @Yuri09067821 https://t.co/dnMtaNi02m
