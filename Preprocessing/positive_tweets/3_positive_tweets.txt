C: (1.000%) T: @cher Wasn't one of those shooters an Elizabeth warren fan? Asking for a friend
C: (0.997%) T: @SNitzsche7 @justanurse25 Elizabeth Warren doesn’t like guns.  She is more of the Bow and Arrow type.
C: (1.000%) T: Why is she not as electable? Elizabeth Warren is rising. But Joe Biden keeps leading on electability.  https://t.co/wLkQHmwZIU
C: (0.531%) T: @TheRealMinchy I hear Elizabeth Warren is a huuuuge skip knot fan
C: (1.000%) T: @SenGillibrand Elizabeth Warren just posted the same thing. I now believe all you Demn candidates would sell your mothers soul for votes. Same playbook and same lack of Character.
C: (0.997%) T: @TheMossadIL That's Elizabeth Warren on his right.
C: (0.995%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren had any PROOF of this question. I SAID NO.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‘murdered by a white police officer’ https://t.co/s8bYy2HBPP via @twitchyteam
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery Julian Castro isn’t genuine to u? Beto is unbelievably authentic &amp; honest. Joe Biden is a lovely person, very relatable. Elizabeth Warren is so smart &amp; passionate - genuinely cares about others. Kamala Harris very accomplished, self made. Corey Booker self made. Bernie cares.
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 I support Elizabeth Warren, a fighter for the common man!
C: (1.000%) T: I understand gun rights supporters feelings on #GunControl legislation, but not voting for Trump is insane, there is no alternative, at least the president can be reasoned with, people like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren cannot. #2A https://t.co/MpQi2zyN7J

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren will say anything to get votes. She has a bad character. https://t.co/MmxzPGi4n9
C: (1.000%) T: @solobarza1899 @AmericanNumbers Canceling debts seven years out and not charging interest to people born in your country is God’s economic policy.   Wasn’t quoting Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: “If audience reception is any indication, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren made the most of that opportunity Friday night. Each received especially rousing ovations during their remarks.” https://t.co/4x41a7azI6

C: (1.000%) T: @FoxFriendsFirst you don't know what's behind the Dayton shooter who was ANTIFA &amp; a Elizabeth Warren supporter but we know what was behind the El Paso shooter. The problem is your reporting of the Facts.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is a fake person of color. I said yes, she’s actually a white supremacist.
C: (0.995%) T: @TruthcastersTv @sethmoulton @SawyerHackett @Castro4Congress Yeah, a white supremacist that supports Elizabeth Warren.  How low of an IQ do you need to be a democrat?
C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren That’s funny.  Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is an Indian.  I said .... https://t.co/SwLaVq39BK
C: (0.974%) T: @StefanMolyneux @H8KUcom Don't worry, all of us from the UK are used to this by now, what with all the Americans claiming to be Irish, Scottish or Welsh with as much relation to these countries as Elizabeth Warren has to native Americans.
C: (0.999%) T: @susanfl04553440 @ddale8 @JoeBiden Yes. Because he is not the best that the Democratic Party has to offer. He's gonna lose to Trump. When you have people like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, or Kamala Harris, supporting Joe Biden is like wanting Trump to have another term.
C: (1.000%) T: @PolitiBunny Today nobody asked me anything about Elizabeth Warren, and until now there was no reason to give her any consideration in any particular matter. America can now resume not paying attention to her.
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/K0qKFujiVR
C: (0.698%) T: @ewarren I was asked today if Elizabeth Warren was a lying socialist.  I said hell yeah
