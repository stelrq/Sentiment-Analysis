C: (1.000%) T: I would like to yell big structural change at Elizabeth Warren at some point in my life so can she come back and do a townhall in MA @ Team Warren https://t.co/UAnIqd2gSf
C: (1.000%) T: “...why wouldn’t it make sense that the model by which a woman could emerge in a presidential sphere might be the same as the one that permitted women entry into the public sphere to begin with?”  https://t.co/b6z9rzk391
C: (1.000%) T: @baronessvond @mattyglesias I know... I am so excited that Elizabeth Warren will be the first Native American front hole haver President!  (We don't use the "w" word anymore,  it's transphobic, and not inclusive)
C: (1.000%) T: I just wanted to say that I always thought Elizabeth Warren was the best https://t.co/WRqPotjMTK
C: (1.000%) T: @SenWarren   Just wondering if Elizabeth Warren EVER sees her OWN Twitter account or answers any of her followers. https://t.co/A13Uuj35xY
C: (1.000%) T: @hyda313 better than red flag laws  https://t.co/xGmJfyMiFu
C: (1.000%) T: I really appreciate the way Elizabeth Warren thinks. Calm, cool, collected, but passionate about issues that MATTER to me.  "Gun violence is a public health crisis. So today, I'm announcing our... https://t.co/BGIvKG5QNr
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC @MaddowBlog MSNBC you are lying. The shooter was an Elizabeth Warren antifa supporter. You stated as fact in your article the the shooter had kinship with President Trump's ideology. That is a lie. You knew that when you published it. Anyone that believes you is simply a dumbass. https://t.co/StjjVGy2oJ
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidJHarrisJr Elizabeth Warren with that look of rage in your face, you look like you’re ready to step in the UFC ring and fight cyborg!
C: (1.000%) T: @brithume @ahemby100 Elizabeth Warren was trying to appear possibly “moderate” by taking a fractionally less socialistic economic stance, but it seems her inner radical just couldn’t take it any longer. Now she’s flown her true colors &amp; slapped down the race card again in a panic as her numbers slip.
C: (1.000%) T: Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%. https://t.co/SNu2AhzNfH via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Tweets like this spark anti police sentiment (reminiscent of Obama era) and fuel mindset that those in charge are against white men. Tweets like this are NOT in the best interest of Americans. Elizabeth Warren should NOT be president. Her viewpoints are polarizing and dangerous.
C: (0.980%) T: Did she really ask … Elizabeth Warren if when she was an Indian if she killed buffalo for their wings? https://t.co/vzsphAazd3
C: (0.988%) T: Thank you @ewarren @SenSanders @CoryBooker @JulianCastro for your support. #WalmartMustAct https://t.co/mX4RKPsdxn
C: (0.883%) T: @BrandonStraka @gatewaypundit Elizabeth Warren is nothing but an old TURD. But, name calling won't win get an election... Policies and plans along with the American Patriots will!!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @G_Shawponee @IAStartingLine Elizabeth Warren waited until AFTER the 2016 Primary before she supported Hillary Clinton who WON the Primary by 3,708.294 MILLION Votes!  Bernie Sanders LOST the Primary by 12.1%.  It wasn’t even close.
C: (0.984%) T: This is how it starts. #CommonSense #MandatoryBuyback  Preventing the purchase of more than one firearm a month.   Survivors will sue manufacturers who acted negligently.   Assault weapons ban.   Tax gun ownership out of existence.   https://t.co/eDcZo4W3L8
C: (1.000%) T: Well if age is a issue I dont want anyone then supporting Bernie or Warren but I personally believe joe has the best chance of winning followed by Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/LWqrktnt4b
C: (1.000%) T: @brithume @DavidAFrench Elizabeth Warren says Trump is a white Supremacist &amp; responsible for the last shootings. Pat Mias disagrees., do you agree or disagree with Pat?   https://t.co/w539tC3cvb
C: (1.000%) T: Well then, don't vote for Elizabeth Warren and preserve YOUR rights!! (she probably won't get the nomination anyway but just sayin...) https://t.co/JRRza8KTiw
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris @TimRyan It’s super refreshing — and lots of other positive adjectives — to see you embrace Andrew Yang, Elizabeth Warren, and now Tim Ryan(‘s son) while on the campaign trail. There’s hope in there somewhere.
C: (1.000%) T: QUIET.  GREAT REPORTER AT WORK   ET:  Sharyl Attkisson, one of the best investigative reporters we've got, takes on Dem presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who is rising rapidly in the polls.  Senator Warren... https://t.co/lfdASxWzd2
C: (1.000%) T: @politico Got 3 phone calls and Politico is making it a big deal, how about fact check Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.
C: (0.997%) T: @COConstitution1 @waconia3 @Imliberaldotcom @TheRickWilson Just today Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, Democratic candidates, tweeted that a white cop murdered Michael Brown, when Obama's Attorney General said the shooting was justified. Democrats are stoking hate and violence and media are providing cover
C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders Bernie took Russian assistance in 2016 to smear Hillary read page 23 and 35 of the Muller report. He continued to sabotage her with Elizabeth Warren so they could both make themselves rich by publishing socialist books and run for president. #myberniestory #neverbernie
