C: (1.000%) T: Warren Joins O‚ÄôRourke in Calling Trump a White Supremacist https://t.co/L0i17QKPmY Well Misery loves Company, especially when you lie about your heritage and lie about your real name to scam votes, and I do not want Socialistic Supremacy, my opinion.

C: (1.000%) T: @NEpats86 @ewarren Hey, moron, ... Trump doesn‚Äôt set the spending budget, Congress does, people just like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Kamala Harris, and Senator Cory Booker. Spend a little time and learn what the hell it is you think you‚Äôre talking about.
