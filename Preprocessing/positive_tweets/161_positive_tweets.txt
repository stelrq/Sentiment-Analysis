C: (1.000%) T: Get this man a podium and put him on the debate stage!  @JulianCastro has policy plans on par with Elizabeth Warren, the fight and determination similar to Kamala Harris, and youth and brilliance to rival Pete Buttigieg. Put some respeck on his name! https://t.co/gVwJPCiAGf
C: (1.000%) T: @michaelwmehaffy Are you really going to defend the US senate as a democratic institution. Sure, Ron and Jeff are awesome. But is it good and desirable that Elizabeth Warren represents 7M Americans and has the same vote as McConnell who represents 4.5M? Land shouldn't vote.

C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC It did make most of the candidates look pitiful. I'm following Elizabeth Warren at least she  "has a plan!" I see to many flailing around and looking for a target just to get the coverage.  Bad strategy
C: (1.000%) T: I just love Elizabeth Warren’s response. No one could have said it better. https://t.co/HDxv6wXRZU

C: (1.000%) T: @DineshDSouza Elizabeth Warren had a little Indian in her, I think it was Chief Crazy Horse
C: (1.000%) T: @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano @ChrisCuomo How is Chris Cuomo black?  Same way Elizabeth Warren is Native American?
C: (1.000%) T: @Carma_2012 @baseballcrank It sure is. It could go on all day. https://t.co/K56D5XjMk0
C: (1.000%) T: @PETMpodcast @BodaciousBeer @JeffBrown781 @ClutchandCoast As long as it goes both ways - if I want to put Elizabeth Warren's name on the side of a race car, for instance - then I don't have a problem with that.
C: (1.000%) T: @newtgingrich I hope Elizabeth Warren does end up being the nominee so that Trump can crush her like a  Cockroach in the street.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is fighting for every American's rights, and for the rights of those who have come here and want to become citizens. She fights to remove corruption from government. We need this kind of person as our leader!
C: (0.543%) T: @grudging1 @DineshDSouza @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight Elizabeth Warren is the most dangerous candidate in this field.

C: (0.978%) T: Ohio police arrested a man with many AR-15 rifles &amp; 10,000 rounds of ammo (!!) who ranted of attacking Planned Parenthood. Happily, MY "thoughts &amp; prayers" maybe helped stop this BEFORE any massacre.  Let's see if the GOP blames him on Elizabeth Warren  https://t.co/cKAmj7Byzc
C: (0.994%) T: @dsparker424 @JulianCastro @realDonaldTrump You want an ad against Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @USA_Patriot_76 @krystalball @AngryVoters I very much like Warren, so this isn't an attack, but she was a Republican until she was 47 years old. https://t.co/JklbmEB4Gx Neither she nor Bernie are lifelong Democrats &amp; it shouldn't matter. They should be loyal to us, not a party.
C: (1.000%) T: Here I was thinking “Nothing would be worse than being forced to spend a day with Elizabeth Warren.”  I was wrong. Being forced to spend a day with Elizabeth Warren would be so much worse if you’re also being forced to eat this... thing. https://t.co/BH4jkxK1e7
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the only one that I’d vote for at this point.
