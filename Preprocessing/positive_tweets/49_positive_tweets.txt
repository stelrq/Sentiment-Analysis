C: (1.000%) T: @St0rm124g3r @ashleylynch Why would that matter? The Dayton shooter was a progressive liberal, an Elizabeth warren fan. He targeted certain people, too. Would his diary make it any more heinous?
C: (1.000%) T: ‚Äú..so that our nation can no longer be held hostage by a small group of well-financed extremists who have already made it perfectly clear that they will never put the safety of the American people first.‚Äù -Elizabeth Warren on her sweeping anti corruption plans. 100% on point 2020
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnFromCranber @ewarren This officer should sue Elizabeth Warren and Corey a Booker as he was found innocent!   Sue their campaigns false stories, destroying a man's character  for personal gain! Trashy move.
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/ZzuFmrN6v1
C: (0.984%) T: @JasmineRollo Your as much a veteran as Elizabeth Warren is Native American
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the real deal. I am beyond excited to vote for her. @ewarren
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's plan to reduce gun violence in the US. Some is terrific, some will alienate all Republican voters, but most of it is solid, common sense change. #Warren2020  https://t.co/AMoEn1rufI
C: (1.000%) T: This is a must read from Elizabeth Warren for 2020 surprise, she has a plan #GunControl -&gt; Protecting Our Communities from Gun Violence - Team Warren - Medium https://t.co/i7FHGgSrFN
C: (1.000%) T: @agarthakingdom @CalticBraven @StewardshipAmer @ChristieC733 @EricTrump For the millionth time, WHERE DID ANY MASS SHOOTER CITE ANY DEMOCRAT AS THEIR REASON FOR COMMITTING TERRORISM? WHERE DID THE DAYTON SHOOTER CITE ELIZABETH WARREN IN HIS MANIFESTO? ANY DEM? EVER? Still waiting for your proof and answer, it‚Äôs been almost a day...
C: (1.000%) T: The company says it offers guns where hunting or clay shooting is popular, but not in certain states like California and not in ‚Äúurban markets.‚Äù "Urban markets"? Racist much, @WalMart ? https://t.co/QKT3EcQrEO
C: (1.000%) T: @BrandonBLW @CaliMamaMAGA @ycars212 @BernieSanders And besides, the image came from recent statistics showing how much grassroots support each Democratic candidate has. Only Elizabeth Warren comes close to reaching Bernie's numbers. So just imagine if the two of them were on the same ticket as President and VP candidates.
C: (1.000%) T: @TobyFost Biden really should drop out of the race. I respect him but I think hes served his time. Although I like Beto O Rourke, Elizabeth Warren would be my preferred candidate.  Her style probably would make Trump more fearful.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is white and feels superior to others so does that make her a white supremacist ü§î‚úåÔ∏è
C: (0.987%) T: @ewarren Wasn‚Äôt the Dayton gun man an insane Elizabeth warren supporter?
C: (0.994%) T: To say that @SenWarren‚Äôs trade policies are as protectionist as @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs is disingenuous, says @rodrikdani https://t.co/cmADKqD8ti
C: (1.000%) T: Goodness. I‚Äôm almost shocked by how much I love Elizabeth Warren. I‚Äôm beginning to feel the same way I felt about the 2007 Obama candidacy.
C: (1.000%) T: @WalshFreedom Shameless Joe the ‚Äústill a Republican‚Äù is trying to shame the honorable, decent, and more imtelligent Elizabeth Warren? That‚Äôs a good one!   Clueless Joe.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren by @rtraister a must read https://t.co/KVwxgzaCKU
C: (0.987%) T: Yes, AND he supported Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @TylerHuckabee @tara_atrandom Okay, so, personally, I'd prefer it if Elizabeth Warren got the nomination. I'm planning on voting for her in the primary.  If she doesn't get it, well, I'll be sad.  And I will still vote for whoever gets the Democratic nomination, because it's the responsible thing to do.
C: (1.000%) T: @gibsonfur If Trump tweeted a list of Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs donors and their businesses, he‚Äôd be doing the same thing Joaquin Castro did, relaying information that is already publicly available.  Let‚Äôs call it what it is.
C: (1.000%) T: @atrupar How about the lefty fan of Elizabeth Warren in Ohio who did same ? What, no mention of this ? Why not ?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has introduced a new plan that would allocate $85 billion in federal funds toward developing broadband networks in rural America. https://t.co/qC7v85aXWv
C: (0.989%) T: Give me Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren pair then I did bet against trump . https://t.co/AlAl4BmQSK
C: (1.000%) T: rather than really investigate or question it, the media/public were too wrapped up in the spectacle and the feeling that ~something was actually happening~ https://t.co/aDZOxDgD5V anyway don't get wrapped up in non-solutions pretending to be.
