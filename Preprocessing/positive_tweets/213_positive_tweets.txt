C: (1.000%) T: Fabulous profile of @ewarren  by @rtraister in @TheCut focusing on Warren’s background as a teacher.   I recently learned from my firm’s Chief Legal Officer that her fiancé was a former student of Warren’s at @PennLaw.   https://t.co/WiFHamQRBk

C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Or maybe, try to keep up junior, they were shaken by nearly getting murdered and didn't want the massive attention a visit from the President would bring or want to talk about it. Also, the Dayton shooter was a liberal inspired by Elizabeth Warren, but we won't talk about that

C: (1.000%) T: @BetteMidler Since you haven't heard the Dayton shooter was an Antifa &amp; an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  BTW, don't know who you are trying to fool with your profile picture, but it's been years since you looked that good.

C: (1.000%) T: @NicolleDWallace Trump doesn't "assault people of color."  Stop the race hustling. Unless you think Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren etc are "people of color."
C: (1.000%) T: ..them all, r saying anything about the Ohio killer. That since the shooter, who actually killed his sister along w/others b4 he was killed, followed Elizabeth Warren &amp; believed in socialism &amp; wants 2 reduce # of people per his manophisto. So Dems r pushing the same thing. If its
C: (1.000%) T: ..the shooter. Period! Yet dems blamed the El Paso deaths on Trump but the Ohio killer who wrote socialism &amp; Elizabeth Warren is the reason 4 his killings including his own sister. Yet no GOP blames her. Why? Bc we understand that u can't b held responsible 4 a deranged persons
C: (1.000%) T: @SawyerHackett @JoeNBC and the domestic terrorist who killed nine idolized the Leftists....would vote for Elizabeth Warren....wake up
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN What does @CNN &amp; the Dayton terrorist have in common?  They are far left. They love Elizabeth Warren. They support the terrorist group Antifa. They advocate violence. They love &amp; spread fake news.
C: (1.000%) T: @JeremyDBoreing @benshapiro If Elizabeth Warren sucks on a lemon, what race is she?
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump We know you are full of it when then Ohio Shooter was a liberal Elizabeth Warren supporter and you don’t say a word about that. You only want to promote hate, lies and violence! #ElPaso
C: (1.000%) T: @Louise54883294 @alroy72082117 @GabbyGiffords They made it so you had to have at least half or maybe a quarter, like a grandparent. I'm not sure but u see my point. By one drop Elizabeth Warren would have been put away if she declared her heritage.. The fact is that your party is the party of slavery. Not Republicans.
