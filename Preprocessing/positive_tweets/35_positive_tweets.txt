C: (0.807%) T: I'm torn as to whether I like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders more...
C: (1.000%) T: This is where Elizabeth Warren demonstrates that she has a plan to fan the flames of racial division and perpetuate a myth.  Clearly she sees that Black America is inching towarss Trump. If Trump gets close to 15% of the Black vote, he wins. Easily. https://t.co/VsPQQObgRV
C: (1.000%) T: @lumitrac @connieleah @Antcarvang @Montlake1987 @charliekirk11 Dems can lie like a rug, and make racist accusations...but that's ok, right? The fucktard who shot Walmart up, was a nut job liberal, just like the Elizabeth Warren, American Indian ohio shooter...
