C: (1.000%) T: I just got blocked by Elizabeth Warren. I am so proud. All I did was speak the truth.
C: (1.000%) T: @theplayerthefan @9BackSurgeries @JumboElliott76 Is that a picture of  Elizabeth Warren  native American ancestor
C: (0.988%) T: @KKeneally The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter though apparently
C: (1.000%) T: SICK: Elizabeth Warren And DNC Fundraising Off Tragedy Of Shootings In El Paso And DaytonNever let a Ching $$ Ching opportunity go to waste! https://t.co/wGwCEMeeOE
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Stop the bologna and do your job. I don’t care what wing the killer is in. Still able to commit mass murder. And Elizabeth Warren doesn’t spout off absurd racially charged comments so bad logic there sir. We need to make it harder to commit these crimes.
C: (1.000%) T: @BruckerHaran This'd be relevant if, say, Elizabeth Warren used a constant tactic of fear-mongering about the evil of girls who didn't pay attention to boys in high school and guys is h.s. who acted like they were better than other guys. How can you not understand this diff b/t her &amp; Trump?
C: (0.988%) T: One shooter was an antifa leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren. IMAGINE after 9/11 anyone putting up with the anti American comments of the squad, exspecially terror group sympathizers ilhan &amp; tlaib &amp;IMAGINE Americans putting up with threats to confiscate our guns! https://t.co/2ZwuRsCXQo
C: (1.000%) T: Male paths to presidential endearment are apparently off the table for women. So what are they going to do? For Elizabeth Warren, the answer lies in her past as a teacher, @rtraister reports https://t.co/T9Kl2Q3uyv
C: (1.000%) T: @WashTimes He was:  - Antifa supporter - Elizabeth Warren fan - Bernie Sanders fan - Democrat  And since we stopped blaming the shooters and started blaming the people that incite them. I hold the DNC, Elizabeth, Bernie and Antifa accountable.
C: (1.000%) T: @AC360 @randikayeCNN and he was a leftist who admired Elizabeth Warren.... don’t forget the facts count or some bullshit you always say...
C: (1.000%) T: @SadFndngFathers @daveweigel @KristenOrthman The Elizabeth Warren supporter posted "Kill every fascist" on twitter.  Antifa accounts started going dark and deactivating when it became known that he was associated with them.
C: (1.000%) T: @DrDenaGrayson @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump White women with blonde hair are known to be predominantly closet racists. They lie to get ahead, just like that Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.803%) T: @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump Everything is always about Trump   El Paso shooter was anti immigration psycho and got triggered when all Dems offered free health care for illegals.  Dayton shooter was far left radical  who supports Elizabeth warren  But never mind all that. It's all Trump fault
C: (1.000%) T: Was a “leftist” “atheist” who wanted socialism, he said he’d vote for Elizabeth Warren. his tweets supported antifa using violence against “white supremacists” and “right wingers” even calling the antifa terrorist who attacked an ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington, a “martyr.” https://t.co/R0iCWhCkit
C: (1.000%) T: @rezaaslan @benshapiro Is Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Dayton mass shooting?  Asking for a friend
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/7H9VH8dApX
C: (0.985%) T: @CochoSgo @AngryJoeShow You're  an idiot the shooter in ohio was an Elizabeth Warren supporting liberal.
C: (0.995%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump So,  the guy in Ohio, was a pro Elizabeth warren ,  the guy that shot up the republican baseball team hated trump,   But Trump better cool in huh?   Just as I begin to think maybe you’re not so bad, you go and someone stupid and it reminds me why I think you are a dipshit
C: (0.995%) T: "…despite even “left-wing” Snopes admitting it’s “true” that MSNBC won’t tell you the Dayton monster was “a pro-Satan leftist who ‘supported Elizabeth Warren.’" - @dcodrea https://t.co/dwmpZkzL2O
C: (1.000%) T: Not your fault ⁦@AOC⁩. Not your fault ⁦@MSNBC⁩  It was his fault. The other mass shooter is not Elizabeth Warren’s fault. None are Trump’s fault either. Let’s be fair please. The American people need representation and facts. Please! Please. https://t.co/gb296LZZhb
C: (1.000%) T: @Tommyboy5186 @BostonGlobe Want to talk about shooters? Let's talk about the Ohio shooter. You know the socialist that supports Elizabeth Warren. I abosultley would have blamed the lying leftists and their propaganda filled news minions. Absolutely disgusting the hate they push and the lies the tell.
C: (1.000%) T: @rezaaslan Huh.  What about the left-wing, socialist terrorism which Democrat politicians seem to be inspiring?  Scalise shooter was a Bernie supporter, for instance.  And Dayton shooter was an avowed socialist, and Elizabeth Warren supporter.  I could go on....
C: (0.985%) T: Wasn’t that the class that Elizabeth Warren Taught? https://t.co/VHDjTm1AwK
C: (0.511%) T: @BetoORourke Funny how the Ohio shooter was a liberal and supporter of Elizabeth Warren.  Liberal hypocrisy.
