C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today i was asked if any democrat presidential candidates were phony, liars hypocrites and I said, YES! Elizabeth Warren a fake wannabe Indian, Francis O'Rourke is face wannabe Mexican, and Kamala Harris actually thinks she's black because she slept with a black man to get a job.

C: (0.951%) T: @BillKristol And, that's an unfollow for your BS against Elizabeth Warren. This country is fucked under Grand Old Pedophiles. You haven't learned a damn thing. Shameful, Bill.
C: (1.000%) T: @travisakers There's the possibility of supporting what's worth supporting and not supporting the rest.    Just the same,  supporting anything that Elizabeth Warren represents is grounds enough not to warrant a response.
C: (0.997%) T: @HillBeverlyhill @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl Amazing all these libs are so worried about republicans being violent.  All I have to say is remember Dayton!  Remember liberal's rhetoric which Dayton shooter used for his reason to kill 9 people-INCLUDING HIS SISTER!  He supported GUN CONTROL, Elizabeth Warren and Socialism!
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 If you really stop &amp; think about it you will find  people like Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker Kamala Harris many others hate themselves so much they can't see the reality in front of them. They hate themselves so much they can't even apply the Golden Rule. Pray for &amp; forgive them!
