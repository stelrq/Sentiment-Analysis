C: (0.985%) T: @MSNBC @maddow What about the Dayton shooter being an Antifa and Elizabeth Warren supporter? Why don't you ever talk about that?
C: (0.988%) T: @KamalaHarris @ewarren Glad that you are kind to Elizabeth Warren. Why are you so unkind to Joe Biden?
C: (0.986%) T: Dear California, I grew up shanking my opposers with icicles and hitting the quan with Elizabeth Warren in Dunkin Donuts parking lots. What do you guys do for fun?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. https://t.co/jTHfJWvtL6
C: (1.000%) T: @travisakers You have Elizabeth Warren in your profile picture. A known liar who used funds she was not entitled to thereby robbing someone else. She has not repented. YOU need to do some soul searching sir. Repentance in ALL sin is required.

C: (1.000%) T: Imagine the excitement in November 2020 if Elizabeth Warren gets to experience the same disappointment Hillary did in 2016. https://t.co/Y2AQgNb9yb
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Right.  Bill Marr is a wacko, Elizabeth Warren is a wacko, Nancy Pelosi is a wacko, and anyone else who opposes you (there are millions of us at this point) are all wackos.  Meanwhile,  you're the only real wacko. Even the staunchest of your supporters know it. You're crazy.
C: (1.000%) T: I am most excited to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  I am least excited to vote for Biden &amp; Sanders, but if push comes to aggressive shove, I'll vote for them to get Trump out of the WH.
C: (1.000%) T: @NateSilver538 Nate, serious question, thanks for your time.  Do you think Elizabeth Warren doubling down on the lie about Michael Brown and Ferguson police will help or hurt her in a primary where the majority of voters are clueless rubes?  Thanks, I'll hang up and listen.
C: (1.000%) T: Forever the billionaires‚Äô and business allies friend, capitalist Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax the super-rich is not structural change‚ÄîIt was tried and failed before. Liz does not tell us ‚Äútax people‚Äôs wealth and they will manage to reduce it or hide it.‚Äù https://t.co/X4b4gPazBj
C: (1.000%) T: @KellySunshineT1 Saw where Scott Adams liked an Elizabeth Warren tweet. Not an interesting one either. Seriously doubt that one too.

C: (1.000%) T: @thehill #BREAKING Joe Biden IS a challenger. So is Elizabeth Warren and about 20 other Democrats. They are all vying for the nomination, and no decision has been made.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúWhat national conservatives propose is government fine-tuning the economy‚Äôs composition and making sure resources are ‚Äúwell‚Äù distributed, as the government (i.e., the political class) decides, forever.‚Äù https://t.co/uhx0qeTsmU
C: (1.000%) T: I SIGNED FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS. Would a background check save Deante Strickland? Portland finally imports a FINE black man that doesn't look like URKEL &amp; his sister shoots him. I bet background checks LEAD to female shooters. YOUR WRONG. https://t.co/O9WVtjQic7 via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: @AmberIrelandRy1 I didn't see where u posted about the mass shooter being a big fan of Elizabeth Warren?? Pretty biased u are lol
C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren tweeted Michael Brown was unarmed and murdered by police. Why didn‚Äôt they indict? Warren lies. A grand jury found no reason to indict due to evidence. Warren is an agitator like the rest of her crime cabal; the democrat party. https://t.co/e0Ut5DpWp8
C: (1.000%) T: We need to get rid of the legislation your BUDDY OBAMA passed that made MULTIPLE ROUNDS possible. WARREN YOUR OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE. EX WIFE TO A REBPUBLICAN. A BITTER DIVORCEE. We need a CLEAR THINKER. Not another CHEERFUL TROUBLE MAKER. https://t.co/O9WVtjQic7 via @HuffPostPol

C: (0.517%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Excuse me Geraldo, I have not seen your Tweet calling out Sen. Elizabeth Warren for her angry rants against @POTUS that greatly influenced the Dayton, Ohio shooter!
