C: (0.937%) T: @PressBeet @pietro_basso The fact of the matter is Elizabeth Warren would be as irrelevant as Harris or Buttigieg in this election if she was not doing a bad impression of Bernie Sanders. They know his platform is too popular to fight it now. The only solution left is Warren...

C: (1.000%) T: Big media has been pushing Elizabeth Warren for years as the antiTrump.  If she becomes the nominee and loses on account of her witless pandering to a tiny group of Leftists, big media will bear as much responsibility as it had in 2016 for electing Trump.
