C: (1.000%) T: How Elizabeth Warren plans to reboot the farm economy. A “full out effort” to decarbonize agriculture. #ElizabethWarren would pour $15 billion each year into a USDA program that pays farmers to adopt #conservation practices.https://t.co/DaLdr4Oq4x

C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders Funny, obama associated with Farrakhan, a known anti Semite. Obama said many racial inflammatory comments. The mass shootings under his Presidency, according to the lefts logic, should b Obama’s fault. By the way, the Ohio shooter was a supporter of Elizabeth warren, a socialist.
C: (1.000%) T: @PattyMurray @senatemajldr While guns are the tools, what motivates a killer is the real problem. The mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio was an Antifa supporter, Elizabeth Warren supporter, and tweeted about "killing fascists." This is the end result when you call Republicans "Nazis" &amp; "traitors" ad nauseam.
C: (0.986%) T: So this is why Rachel Dolezal and Elizabeth Warren did what they did. It wasn’t to game the system, but out of shame. https://t.co/QhxApcMxR3
C: (1.000%) T: @tlgray17 @realDonaldTrump @peterschweizer No. What I'm saying is the Left had always been the party of hate, ALWAYS. They only cover the El Paso shooter because he appeared to be a conservative at first. The Dayton shooter is an Elizabeth Warren and Bernie fan. This doesn't fit their narrative of hating Trump. Got it?
C: (1.000%) T: @machelle33mom @BetoORourke Shame on you. Seriously. Shame on you. You live here and you know only one person was responsible. Blame Elizabeth warren for the Dayton shooting? I’m so disheartened that someone in our community is buying into this crap. Just nothing else to say but shame on you. Bad parenting.
C: (1.000%) T: @FivedoIIars are you sure that it's not parody? one of the first repliers is someone saying that 'Elizabeth warren is the chuck Norris of our time'
C: (0.876%) T: @FactsOrFables4U @RealCandaceO @AOC @BetoORourke He also didn’t quote Elizabeth Warren or AOC before his rampage like that p.o.s. did before he slaughtered those innocent people in El Paso and also like the other psycho did in New Zealand
C: (1.000%) T: @Mumon7 White privilege is pretty questionable anymore. Look at Shaun King, Rachel Dolezal and Elizabeth Warren. They're all white people who misrepresented their ethnicity because it was an advantage to not be white.
C: (1.000%) T: Yeah "privilege" is warbling Elizabeth Warren handing Trump a lifetime dictatorship because her ego made her run against Bernie, while calling his platform her own. She makes me want to puke. https://t.co/NcyBHp9Auo
C: (1.000%) T: @SenSanders Maybe they should just stop taking out student loans and question why Elizabeth Warren made $400k to teach just one class?
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @FoxNewsOpinion Thanks Marc for reminding viewers that the mass murderer in Dayton favored Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Answer: #ElizabethWarren2020 is running in all 50 states. She will be coming to your state if she hasn't done so already. She takes and answers ordinary people's questions. She listens.  Question. Why is Elizabeth Warren gaining in popularity? https://t.co/mJ4laHu46R
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump What about the Dayton shooter that wanted Elizabeth Warren to win, quoted @RepAOC and was followed by many CNN anchors
C: (1.000%) T: @wedblues I hope that goes for Maxine Waters, Elijah Cummings, John Lewis, Sheila Jackson Lee, Alexandria Ocassio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer...All of the well known Democratic Race Baiters in Congress.
C: (1.000%) T: “Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.”  @OANN   I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!
C: (0.994%) T: @AOC Elizabeth Warren Alexandria ocasio-cortez CNN and MSNBC is the reason for all these shootings you caused the shootings in Ohio or nine people died they were Elizabeth Warren supporter Democrat how come the media is not talking about that you scumbags
C: (1.000%) T: @JeffMerkley How about the shooter loving Antifa and being a big Elizabeth Warren fan Jeff
C: (1.000%) T: Great read. Warren exemplifies what teaching is all about: believing in students, trying hard to do away with inequities in the classroom, being hard on students while showing you truly care, and letting your dog hold office hours (I wish)   https://t.co/RRlj71dTlq
C: (0.989%) T: .@ewarren's team met with more than 100 Iowa farmers to develop this plan, her campaign told me. https://t.co/Rcx6ZZPnKY via @DMRegister

C: (1.000%) T: @SenSherrodBrown  mr. Betts was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and a self-avowed member of antifa, the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party! Domestic terrorist! Are you going to condemn antifa? I haven't heard you say one word about that terrorist group that this man admired!
C: (0.987%) T: Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan ‘leftist’ who supported Elizabeth Warren  - https://t.co/21PmMj0OeQ - @washtimes
C: (1.000%) T: @EllenTracy13 @SenTomCotton That are hated by socialists like Bernie Sanders,Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. What a surprise. They all hate that ELITES&amp; try to get WORKERS out to protest against that elites.  But smart elites from both parties will continue to rule and I'm hapy about that
