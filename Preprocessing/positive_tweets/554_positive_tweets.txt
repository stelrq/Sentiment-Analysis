C: (0.999%) T: @ProLifeTexanUSA @POTUS The blackface memorabilia is a lie. You could have quickly learned this was debunked. Oh, let me guess--you don't believe the debunk. This dumb lie is the worst you've got against Warren &amp; the best you've got to refute the fact that Trump is racist? üôÑ  https://t.co/oIXQFvjZcp https://t.co/MVhWRYVIIF
C: (0.988%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren? Are you using a funny nickname for Trump?

C: (1.000%) T: Love Elizabeth Warren, concerned, though, when shows like - 'Halloween', feature 'Warren's County law enforcement'. In politics, do what's ethical, make -enemies, obviously.  That said, I will support Democrat or Progressive candidate with best chance of winning, whomever that is https://t.co/zUMjwVxlNs

C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow TRANSLATED FROM RWNJ: Elizabeth Warren has a positive and unifying message, a track record of scrupulously honest public service, and should be in the White House on January 20, 2021.
