C: (1.000%) T: @MillzXio @pour_mea_coffee @Hakuna_Matassa @RyanAFournier So the guy in Dayton was due to Elizabeth Warren’s evil rhetoric?   Can you figure that one out Mr. Second grader?  Or is that different since he’s a lefty?  And y’all wonder why no one takes you seriously.  You don’t deserve the attention you so desperately crave and you’re FOS.
C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders You do realise that the Ohio shooter would have voted for you or Elizabeth Warren... You should be careful throwing rocks while living in that glass house..
C: (0.996%) T: @freep These shooters were both Antifa loving Liberals. Both hated Trump according to their social media pages. They were incited by Bernie and Elizabeth Warren rhetoric as well as the MSM. MSNBC and CNN are part of the problem.
C: (0.757%) T: The difference between Trump and Obama and the current crop of Democrat leaders is, in the case of the Dayton killer who was a Elizabeth Warren fan, Trump doesn't blame Warren like Democrats are blaming him for El Paso. He's blaming the shooters. Bravo! https://t.co/wvSmySqUHG
C: (1.000%) T: @JRubinBlogger Has anybody seen Elizabeth Warren since last week interesting isn’t it how she’s hiding her name was mention by one of the deranged and she’s gone silent just goes to show how dangerous Warrens words are......and she’s not fit to be our leader ever
C: (1.000%) T: I have to say, there is an amazing magic feeling to being in the guts of public policy and complaining bitterly about this important thing that no one seems to understand or care about outside of your niche and then Elizabeth Warren mentions it in her plan and it’s glorious.
C: (0.963%) T: @NigelJohnsonFL Did the “white nationalist in chief” inspire the attack in Ohio or was that bernie sanders and Elizabeth warren, of whom he endorsed.
C: (1.000%) T: Warren’s plan, one of the most liberal rolled out by 2020 Democrats so far, is aimed at breaking up big corporations, paying farmers fair prices, reducing overproduction and encouraging more environmental conservation. How Elizabeth Warren plans to reboot the farm economy https://t.co/TPDuCwPMY6
C: (1.000%) T: @BerniesBack2020 Do you really think Tulsi would drop out and endorse Bernie? I’d like to believe that but.. How low do her polling results have to get for that to happen? Also, I’ve heard more pro-Bernie stuff from Elizabeth Warren than Tulsi Gabbard so far.
C: (1.000%) T: Two Debates in and Joe Biden is still the front runner according the polls, but Elizabeth Warren is catching up.  We break down the latest 2020 Democratic polling and some BIG surprises. https://t.co/d9lKkfsBK3
C: (0.989%) T: Farticus will try anything to make Elizabeth Warren President, bc he AIN’T going to be. https://t.co/N8cIxdhVCN
C: (0.999%) T: @aterkel @danielmarans Elizabeth Warren is kind of pretentious (reckless); even in countries that are easily reformable like Germany and France she would not accomplish half of what she’s talking about!
C: (0.995%) T: @BernieSanders Hey Bernie, did you know that both shooters were supporters of yours and Elizabeth Warren? Idiot
C: (1.000%) T: @SandyShriver1 @realDonaldTrump @OANN That means the Dem is associated w/neo-Nazi &amp; white supremacy because in August, the 8th month, only 8 dem candidates have made it to the next debate, &amp; Elizabeth Warren who in August the 8th month, has 8% poll rating in the recent Quinnipiac University National Poll .

C: (0.525%) T: @JoeBorelliNYC Don’t bury the lede. Are you telking NYers that you are NOT following Elizabeth Warren?! :) :)
C: (1.000%) T: @louisvillemayor @GovMattBevin The reason there was a shooter in Dayton Oh. Was because he was a Elizabeth Warren loving , cop hating, open borders loving , LEFTIST!    FACT!!!
C: (1.000%) T: This coming from someone who supports a president who called Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas, accused Obama of being a radical Muslim and not American, called most Mexicans rapists, called white supremacists very fine people, the list goes on.    Please don't lecture me on morality! https://t.co/qxhyXhlMdq
C: (1.000%) T: “Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.” @OANN   I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you! https://t.co/ZAhmAd7ftV
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnBrennan Hey Brennan, the 1st &amp; 2nd Amendment are telling you to GFYS.   By the way, the Dayton shooter was inspired by your "hate speech." Connor Betts was an Antifa supporter, an Elizabeth Warren supporter, &amp; supported socialism. Your words inspire mass murder.
C: (0.987%) T: Elizabeth Warren outlines $85 billion rural broadband plan https://t.co/mG34eYf6oW via @politicususa
C: (0.974%) T: Embarrassing to watch Fox coverage of @SenSherrodBrown and @daytonmayor, Nan Blakely....just can't say anything nice because then they would be bad Demwits and the party might belittle them.... Wow, the killer in Dayton was a follower of Elizabeth Warren, a member of your party! https://t.co/NNyhruF7uD
C: (1.000%) T: @MeghanMcCain @kim @TheView Who do you think will be nominated out of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders he's on Ben and Jerry's ice cream so I think he will make it to the end. My guess is Ben and Jerry's are probably donating to his campaign. Do you think we will finally have the first woman president or do
C: (1.000%) T: @beachboyfreak So true. Talk about devicive talk both Brown and the Mayor,  should think before they speak.  No mention of the shooters support of Elizabeth Warren and Antifa.  Or the many complaints against the shooter and that nothing was done.
C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren calls Trump a white supremacist https://t.co/SK2v148PSQ via @Yahoo
