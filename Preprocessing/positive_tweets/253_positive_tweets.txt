C: (1.000%) T: @chrislongview Elizabeth Warren isn’t even on the ragged edge of Hillary Clinton. Not in intellect, not in political aptitude, not in experience, not in policy making.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is misled. He is not necessarily a "racist." What he is doing is what Hitler did to polarize Germany by singling out Jews as inferior and dangerous subhumans. For Trump, it's not just Mexicans but anyone with brown skin. Sadly his ploy is apparently working.

C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions No boo.  His rape/kill girls list from high school pretty much said "I hate women and will kill as many as possible when I get a chance". Elizabeth Warren never said "send them back".  Never said "hispanic invasion".  Never said "they are animals". Bless your heart.
C: (1.000%) T: @RayPatterson100 @TuckerCarlson When did a mass shooter parrot Elizabeth Warren and what did he say? I missed this. Her platform isn't built on denigrating and dehumanizing entire ethnic groups.

C: (1.000%) T: Was Obama “electable”? Did Democrats consider him electable? Maybe what Aaron Blake is saying that Warren needs smile more  The real question is whether the media will be sexist (like Todd or Lauer) or play pussycat like they did with Trump https://t.co/K5WAF727QQ https://t.co/FbWLQXtwkD

C: (1.000%) T: @SethAMandel Now she is advocating German cars?  Because in the context of being Elizabeth Warren, that would make a lot more sense than what she said.
C: (0.988%) T: Just saw a tweet reporting that Elizabeth Warren likes the word, "porch", and a man respond to that tweet by calling porches colonialist  Can't wait for the primaries to be over.
