C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 If you fail to see the El Paso shooter used Trump's words to justify his shooting, but the Dayton shooter did not use Elizabeth Warren's, you are the REAL problem.  Right, Chuck?
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 People like Elizabeth Warren's rhetoric is endangering her fellow Americans. I would not feel safe with any Democrat being President as the hate half of their fellow Americans and demonize us every time there is a microphone near them🇺🇸
C: (0.995%) T: @GeniaGlover @ulrich462 @devwillia @MsActiviss @MrToddMarshall1 @ananavarro @melbuns Yep including the Elizabeth Warren supporter. Can you say or spell MORON.💯🤡
C: (1.000%) T: Pro Tip: Making your alarm tone, Elizabeth Warren saying "You don't get what you don't fight for". Is a great way to ensure that you are on a energy high all day.

C: (0.986%) T: ELECTABILITY IS NOT A THING. Vote for the candidate that inspires you the most. Chances are if they inspire you, they inspire other people too https://t.co/ZUbvYqimqZ
C: (1.000%) T: You are for Beto, I saw your profile, which is fine, but  ELIZABETH WARREN  Can KNOCK-OUT TRUMP on so many different levels.  Beto is not experienced enough but is a great politician too. I have respect for his ideals, especially bicultural issues. https://t.co/nFOWLstsG7
C: (1.000%) T: @cobonita @TrumpWarRoom @JulianCastro El Paso was pissed about illegals getting free healthcare. And found a gun free shopping center in Texas. Dad was a therapist that followed John of God.  Dayton is a Elizabeth Warren fan. Mom has a $27 million darpa gov. contract that also works for a man connected to Epsilon. https://t.co/BCGgERmQuM
C: (0.995%) T: @brithume Officer Darren Wilson should sue Elizabeth Warren for calling him a murderer and doing his job.
C: (1.000%) T: Um..I should probably tell Elizabeth Warren that this really hot chick with short hair and goth makeup and a foam covered leotard just asked if I was a god. I said yes. 🍑🍆🍒
C: (0.992%) T: My read is that there is a generational split.  Older seem to be "O.K." with Joe Biden.  Younger,  not so much. https://t.co/NBuysrR6Sp
C: (1.000%) T: @BuckSexton ...SHE CAN'T STOP. Just like Hillary, and AOC, and Booker, and others, She sold her soul to satan, and Soros, her eyes bulged out, and now she does his bidding.

C: (1.000%) T: @observantjulie @sairasameerarao Seriously is that where it is? Wow . See if you say you are from Asia, point taken. Heck say that you are South Asian and yuh ou are correct. Calling yourself Asian is like Elizabeth Warren calling herself Indian. #AwwYouLibsAreSoPrecious
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister I love Elizabeth Warren.  However will she get the black voters out?  Best ticket Warren &amp; Harris.
C: (1.000%) T: @brithume The race relations pot was starting to calm down. Elizabeth Warren: let me go ahead and stir that up a little bit
C: (1.000%) T: @45needstogo1 @PadmaLakshmi We must ask ourself: “HOW do we think the government should work and WHO do we think the government should WORK FOR?” ~ Elizabeth Warren   Because politicians who do nothing when they see children being ripped away from their parents...we either vote for them or vote them OUT!
C: (1.000%) T: If you like Elizabeth Warren, read this. https://t.co/F8vWe1DVzc
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren wants the government controlling all of the information we receive? What could possibly go wrong? What are we North Korea?
