C: (1.000%) T: @AnarchoPigeon @tianyuli42 @DemBourbon @frziggurats @niauropsaka @ErikLoomis Those who talk about Sanders being better on FP, know little about both their FP views, the similarities &amp; differences. Only significant diff is Sanders evolved on Israel earlier than she did.  https://t.co/kXBOO3qSw8 84%  https://t.co/wSgkijlYy5 88%  https://t.co/SyGwOCrg2w 51%

C: (1.000%) T: My utopian dream is a fiat cryptocurrency with a built-in negative interest rate instead of an Elizabeth-Warren-Style wealth tax.  You are then incentivized to make investments in less-liquid, non-currency assets so that you can keep your wealth. https://t.co/tqhph1p8ia

C: (1.000%) T: @Planet_Phoebe @RogueOpsCommand @Wonderbitch81 @Drivebythinker @TheMarschallin I like Elizabeth Warren.  I like her a lot.  I have the t-shirt and refrigerator magnet to prove it.  That does *not* mean that I have to run around defending her on this issue.  She was *wrong*.  What she did was *wrong*.  And Native people have every right to be upset about it.
C: (0.950%) T: @MNFarmersUnion On 8/7/2019, Elizabeth Warren tweeted:  "Agriculture has become one of the biggest polluters in our economy, thanks to decades of failed policy. By paying farmers to fight climate change and investing in R&amp;D we can tackle climate change."  WARNING!  It's a farm takeover!

C: (1.000%) T: @ZerlinaMaxwell @TheMominatrixx Elizabeth Warren is not anti corporations, she is only anti corruption. She's also the one candidate that makes the GOP wet themselves at the mere mention of her name, which is one of the many reasons I'm voting for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Like, I'm 100% on the Elizabeth Warren train at this point, but I'll be voting for literally whoever gets the Dem nod, including Bernie Sanders, who I have a deep and longstanding dislike of.  Trump has done measurable harm. Virtually ANYTHING is preferable.  We shouldn't let...
