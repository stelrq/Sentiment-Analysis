C: (1.000%) T: @MyNameIsNurf @ewarren I'm not a big Joe Rohan fan but I think it'd be good for his listeners to hear from Elizabeth Warren. I think they would like her ideas and plans. She's also fantastic at interviews.

C: (0.999%) T: @DebColumb @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends The one in Ohio like posts by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders so I would argue that that had nothing to do with white supremacy.

C: (1.000%) T: @northis180 @washingtonpost This doesn’t seem to fit your narrative well. Dayton shooter was actually an Antifa supporter. Are you ready to call it a people problem or is it still rhetoric?? If it’s rhetoric then aoc and elizabeth warren have some denouncing to do
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Oh..Gee Rob, You forgot to mention the mass slaughter in Dayton. Guess an Antifa, Satan,  Bernie and Elizabeth Warren fan doesn't quite fit your narrative !
C: (1.000%) T: The fact that this needs to be done at all is completely unacceptable. “I will appoint FCC Commissioners who will restore net neutrality, regulating internet service providers as ‘common carriers’ and maintaining open access to the Internet,”  https://t.co/yrAJMKTlBT

C: (0.992%) T: Mr. Trump quoted a conservative television news outlet’s reporting that “the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.” https://t.co/HgQ0pwzGf1 repulsive as are toadies who parrot this nonsense
C: (0.994%) T: @ladyc10 It depends on the candidate. Elizabeth Warren, for example, poses more of risk of depressing voter turnout than she does increasing voter turnout. All Democrats have to do is stay focus on Trump but they’re blowing it with their policy proposals.
