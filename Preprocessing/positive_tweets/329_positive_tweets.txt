C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Elizabeth Warren didn‚Äôt call brown people infestations nor did she bask in chants of ‚Äúsend them back‚Äù at rallies. Nor did she target people of color for online harassment. Deflections wont save you. You will blow this trip because you do not have an empathetic bone in your body.
C: (1.000%) T: @hiltzikm @BruceBartlett @WSJ But IDK what "Elizabeth Warren" has to do with it. I can't read it right now. I live next to one of the cities &amp; it feels like I'm too close to what happened. My daughter &amp; her godfather live even CLOSER to Dayton.
C: (1.000%) T: @lnTheDarkWeLive @h0memadetweets @CoryBooker Which one is the Antifa, Elizabeth Warren supporter? Where's all the terrorist pics from 911, and all the others you left out? Oh, I get it, they don't fit the bogus narrative your peddling..

C: (1.000%) T: @rtraister Elizabeth Warren can‚Äôt make us do the work of banding together to defeat corruption, inequality, injustice. But maybe she can use inclusive teaching methods to help us come to the conclusion‚Äîon our own‚Äîthat such action is necessary, and possible. That is a wild sentence to type.
C: (0.998%) T: @iamcardib Hey Cardi baby, the Dayton shooter was a Democrat, and a huge fan of Elizabeth Warren. He was a Satanic worshiper and had nothing to do with white supremacy
C: (0.782%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Guess what Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren DONT do? Say and do racist sh#t, and egg people on toward violence against their political opponents. These #WhiteNationalists are following YOUR lead, asshat.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Unity, right? If there's any justice in this world, come 2020, Elizabeth Warren will be sitting in that office while you sit in jail.
C: (1.000%) T: Here is Trump calling out the Mayor of Dayton and Elizabeth Warren. The Unity Tour 2019 is off to a great start. https://t.co/81QAU6SGDG

C: (0.985%) T: @RacerX57217102 @realDonaldTrump So using your rationale, Elizabeth Warren and Antifa inspired the Dayton shooter?
C: (1.000%) T: @rachbarnhart This was in no way Trump's fault. Unless you want to admit the Dayton shooter is Elizabeth Warren's fault... It's funny how you and the media keep that part on the down-low about the politics of the Dayton shooter... Did Trump pull the trigger? Did he tell him to shoot people? NO
C: (0.999%) T: @DameleDavid @mjammon @Kimberlina2000 @PattyArquette @JohnCornyn @WSJ Elizabeth Warren doesn't use violent, incendiary rhetoric designed to cause fear and hate of other groups of people. Trump does all the time. It's obvious and anyone with a functioning brain can see the difference.
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan boy.
C: (1.000%) T: @KellyScaletta I‚Äôm really like Elizabeth Warren. That being said, I will be supporting whoever the candidate ends up being. It is not the time to be wasting your vote to ‚Äúprotest.‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren supporters have a blind spot for her appropriation problem.  Some of y'all just scream and say Trump's attacks on her aren't fair.  Guess what?  Stealing a whole damn race to get a job is WRONG.  Just because you don't see it doesn't mean everyone else won't.
C: (0.992%) T: Now tell us about the Dayton killer who was a huge fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Real problem or nah? https://t.co/lzcpwggcbS
C: (1.000%) T: @ndrew_lawrence A Leftist murdered 9 in Ohio who justified his actions by quoting AOC and being a follower of Elizabeth Warren. I notice that the news is silent is this. Are we to conclude that Leftists are a problem and that you want these things to continue to happen?
C: (1.000%) T: @karenjocole @RealSaavedra Notice nobody in MSM is blaming Elizabeth Warren who the Ohio Shooter supported and he was an Antifa Socialist who liked Bernie Sanders as well. But it‚Äôs crickets.
C: (1.000%) T: This is the best profile of Elizabeth Warren you could read. It‚Äôs worth your time. https://t.co/VWv4CVd1RW
