C: (1.000%) T: @sairasameerarao Curious what you think of Elizabeth Warren who pretended to be American Indian for the benefit she could get from this false association. How do you really feel about her? How do you feel about White Democrats in general?
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @ambertamblyn I have a plan to vote for Elizabeth Warren. Hope it can come to fruition.
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps I stan an Elizabeth Warren look a like.   And how much of a pos do you have to be to be compelled to say something like this?
C: (0.742%) T: @cascamike @MeetThePress By ‘she’, I mean Elizabeth Warren. Why does that make her too far left??
C: (1.000%) T: This thread is one big reason I support Elizabeth Warren. She gets this. https://t.co/ofPPvYmCeF
C: (1.000%) T: It is weird how MAGA people act like this is some kind of gotcha.  If Bill Clinton’s a pedophile, send the fucker the jail. If Obama’s a pedophile, send him to jail. If Elizabeth Warren is a pedophile, send her to jail.  Send anyone who’s a pedophile to jail, I don’t care who. https://t.co/eZDl2A4BL9
C: (1.000%) T: @ZerlinaMaxwell For one, I am sick of incrementally slow walking progress for the hard working people of America, it is time for bold actions for bold programs to improve all aspects of the freedoms we are supposed to enjoy in America, go Elizabeth Warren!
C: (0.997%) T: This isn’t true of most national conservatives, but a number of “post-liberals” are just pro-life Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/BUY53U1DDT

C: (1.000%) T: @saltyconchy @NewKindOfPol @TVietor08 @BetoORourke So then Elizabeth warren caused the Dayton shooting, AOC the synagogue and El Paso(he cited too many people on the planet and climate change which has been preached by her), Bernie caused the Scalise shooting, and BLM the Dallas cop shooting? Or does it only work one way?
C: (1.000%) T: This is absolutely worth the read. Do. It!  https://t.co/NQGdn50ncD
C: (0.989%) T: @james_roe .@SenWarren Why did you endorse HRC when you knew the DNC rigged the primaries in 2016? https://t.co/VTOvNvdNEr
C: (1.000%) T: Dayton Shooter Was Leftist Antifa, Satanist, inspired by Elizabeth Warren &amp; CNN https://t.co/qOjTt2lHwC via @YouTube #Resist #Resistance #BlueWave #Indivisible #TheResistanceIsUnited #FBRParty #FBR  #NAACP #BET #ET #TMZ #GMA #Today #UniteBlue #Progressive #VoteBlue #TheMarySue
C: (1.000%) T: @lauramhartman @jaegermaestro @ma4justice @BirdRockMama @DebraMessing @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr Laura, let's play a game .. see how smart you are and how ignorant we are.  Do you believe what Chief Elizabeth Warren said below? https://t.co/DIjaiI45eM
C: (1.000%) T: @JaneLytv Did you fact check this actual lie from Elizabeth Warren? https://t.co/mBNltXKDHK
C: (1.000%) T: It’s why I was so turned off how nuclear war even became a taking point for Elizabeth Warren two wks ago. People are fucking gross and way more in love with this shit (capitalism, warmongering, etc) than they like to admit. Like how even are we discussing nuclear weapons in 2019? https://t.co/mbSzc6oYlo
C: (0.989%) T: @YahooNews Ohio murderer was a left-wing nut Elizabeth Warren and Antifa supporter
C: (0.989%) T: Let's Do This!!  Elizabeth Warren has a new plan to reduce gun violence by 80 percent https://t.co/vk2YILpt0n via @voxdotcom
C: (0.926%) T: Check out what Michael Bloomberg told Elizabeth Warren backstage [in article below] &amp; you'll understand why @Everytown &amp; @MomsDemand is perennially more conservative than the gun control grassroots. https://t.co/frYKfU2Aly #GunControlNow
C: (1.000%) T: @zachekeyy The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth warren supporter, and you see a lot more from my side because the media covers ZERO from the democratic side. Every mainstream media is owned by a liberal. It’s just another way they brain wash you and everyone else to hate donald trump
C: (1.000%) T: #Warren2020 ewarren: Over fifty years, comprehensive safety measures reduced per-mile driving deaths by almost 80% and prevented 3.5 million automobile deaths. We have to do the same for gun deaths—and I have a plan for that. https://t.co/IQJ8x4fQlK
C: (1.000%) T: @allahpundit @benshapiro Never trumpers dont make a peep when Elizabeth Warren says Michael Brown was murdered a conspiracy theory. Shows your true colors
C: (1.000%) T: Kamala Harris-Elizabeth Warren would be a dream ticket! #2020
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren this week announced a new proposal to fight against the stranglehold telecoms have on broadband access. “She wants to make it clear in federal statute that municipalities have the right to build their own broadband networks.” https://t.co/aFyExPrdCB
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren we have gun laws that are not being enforced by Congress or the fbi. We don't  need anymore. The NRA is not the problem. Enforce our existing laws. Lawful people have the right to keep and bare arms. Start doing your job. https://t.co/RnWHhqqoPe
