C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren invested and began hiring in Iowa early. Still a lot of time left, obviously.  We'll see what happens. https://t.co/RCF71uT7B7

C: (1.000%) T: President Trump "has given aid &amp;comfort to white supremacists" &amp; "done the wink and a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people," Elizabeth Warren said. "He's done everything he can to stir up racial conflict &amp; hatred in this country."#WhiteNationalistsProblems

C: (1.000%) T: Interesting take on @EWarren's ideas on trade, which also discusses her intent to link market access to #FossilFuelSubsidies. Sharing does not imply endorsement, though I, too, would like to understand the devils residing in the details of Warren's plans.  https://t.co/zS6WskvzMO

C: (1.000%) T: @ananavarro @JoeBiden I agree w/u 100% but I have 2 say I am disappointed in Biden's performance - it feels like he is just phoning it in &amp; counting on the carryover favoritism toward an older white man. I am not seeing the energy or plans 4 the future like Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren A US Senator, Elizabeth Warren, makes $15,000 a MONTH to talk. A US Marine (pvt) makes $19,000 a YEAR to secure Warren’s senate seat.   My 2 cents is Warren should make the same salary as a Marine, certainly not more.
C: (0.984%) T: @DouglifeDouglas @KevinLNyc @jeffzeleny @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump Here's 2 not glowing piece on Warren from the paper who is so unfair to Bernie.  Stop whining.  https://t.co/H2L4rSqX5A  https://t.co/IntkuDMyYS
C: (0.696%) T: @psychwriter1515 @JMo2221 @peterdaou @BernieSanders @ewarren And certainly Biden has spearheaded regressive policies but when you get to the point of calling -Elizabeth Warren- a corporate lackey, you're starting to lose the plot a bit.
C: (0.986%) T: #InvisiblePrimary h/t: @huzzahmpls  Warren picks up an endorsement in IL. One of the out-of-state variety that remains at least somewhat rare. #EndorsementPrimary https://t.co/IdggMpls1u

C: (1.000%) T: @SenhorRaposa He knows he wouldn't stand a rat's ass chance against Elizabeth Warren or Ed Markey
C: (1.000%) T: I have no idea how anyone who calls his/herself neoliberal can possibly support elizabeth warren, yet somehow, a huge proportion of self-identified neoliberals do   1/ https://t.co/R3k7lRUsBs
C: (1.000%) T: @SenSanders I voted for you last primary election. I'm worried though since Elizabeth Warren is running also. If you and her joined on the same ticket it would be like the dream team. I believe you and her could beat Biden.
C: (0.529%) T: @asmamk @nprpolitics “Elizabeth Warren Believes White Supremacists.” Strange vibe to put out there.
C: (1.000%) T: @JennyTXDem @zivinilee @Martina Elizabeth Warren couldn't get elected mayor of a Texas trailer park if you filled her pockets with hundred dollar bills and Meth.
C: (1.000%) T: @TwitterMoments LMFAO! Hey Curt, what happened? I thought you were running against Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts? I guess you knew they were too smart to vote for an idiot like you so you took off to AZ. LOL

C: (1.000%) T: @RhondaBarket I think Elizabeth Warren would make the best president of the candidates, however I think Biden has the best possible chance to beat Trump because old white men will vote for him. Either way I will support the nominee.
