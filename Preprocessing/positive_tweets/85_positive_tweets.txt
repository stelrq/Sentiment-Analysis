C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is surging. This one big question looms over her. - The Washington Post https://t.co/QitRGyIR11
C: (1.000%) T: @WordswithSteph @acnewsitics Have you told the same to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?! Both have had followers commit mass shootings. How about Obama?!... Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Pulse Night Club...
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx 11. Sure, Castro wouldn‚Äôt pull the trigger, they can say, but someone will, someone like Connor Betts. Before he killed en masse in Dayton, Ohio, Betts said online a few positive things about Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.988%) T: @GeraldoRivera @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump How about Elizabeth Warren the Dayton shooter loved her why is she judging him
C: (0.988%) T: Beto O‚ÄôRourke &amp; Elizabeth Warren Call Trump A ‚ÄúWhite Supremacist‚Äù  @axios @jacobsoboroff  https://t.co/O9K7EIuiEC
C: (0.992%) T: @Jeepster77Don @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS Following your ‚Äúlogic‚Äù, the Dayton shooter blindly followed Elizabeth Warren &amp; Antifa, and that‚Äôs okay? What happened to personal responsibility?ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
C: (1.000%) T: It's pretty adorable how she plays this off like adorable serendipity while her bio literally says her job is to follow Elizabeth Warren around. What do they teach in J school? https://t.co/pd6wAZyeov
C: (0.987%) T: @COPDLiving @nypost Or the ICE attacker who was an @AOC supporter? Or the Dayton shooter who was an @ewarren Elizabeth Warren supporter? Or the El Paso shooter who was a @SenSanders Bernie supporter?  But nah, let‚Äôs just keep blaming Trump....
C: (0.988%) T: @PeteKidder @LaylaAlisha11 @sewwutnow @acnewsitics I think the guy in Texas was ANTIFA, the guy in Ohio was a registered Democrat for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: "Sanders is also the runaway leader in the number of contributions he‚Äôs received from Arizonans with 2,215, more than twice as many as Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and five times as many California U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris." https://t.co/Q4obXdjgCT via @arizonamirror
C: (0.989%) T: why won‚Äôt DSA endorse Elizabeth Warren? https://t.co/Rm2hULNOHA
C: (1.000%) T: @morningmika Maybe you should cover the fact that the shooters support Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
C: (1.000%) T: It makes no sense that the WP on one hand states @ewarren is surging and on the other may not be electable. The fact that polls show that *more* people want to vote for her inherently means she's more electable.  https://t.co/s4wtwxjEEV
C: (1.000%) T: @ABCPolitics @ABC Did everyone know that the Dayton shooter was for Elizabeth Warren. Why is it not all over, if he was for Trump it would be 24-7. Fake news Trump 2020
C: (0.999%) T: @MSNBC Elizabeth Warren and the 2020 democratic presidential candidates talking to farmers...   Talk about trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist https://t.co/rP4IWN69ir
C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker What u failed 2 point out is the shooter in Ohio was antifa, who claimed he's democrat &amp; support Elizabeth Warren &amp; Barnie Sanders. U sold your soul 2 the devil, George Soros, who been 1 to destroy America from inside out. U used any opportunity to demonize this POTUS. https://t.co/GfAZGtB0ea

C: (1.000%) T: @nberlat @21stCenturyFDR Bernie diehards are great at spreading false info, their records aren't really that diff. Bernie evolved on Israel earlier than her, but that's about it.   https://t.co/kXBOO3qSw8 84%  https://t.co/wSgkijlYy5 88%  https://t.co/SyGwOCrg2w 51%
C: (1.000%) T: @AuthorKimberley @AllisonRFloyd Elizabeth Warren can beat him because she has in ascerbic tongue oh, she's right intelligent knows the issues, and is fearless. Watch her Senate hearing on YouTube tapes. #Fierce
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren He‚Äôs as much a white supremacist as you are a Cherokee Indian.  üòÇ You Elizabeth Warren (along with a lot of other Dems) are race baiting, hateful, horses asses that are saying EVERYTHING you can think of to divide this country to peddle votes. It‚Äôs not working- ppl walking away.
C: (0.994%) T: @Face123Moose @benshapiro Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs plan would literally be better than having to fucking call AT&amp;T over and over again to dispute miscellaneous goddamn charges on my fucking wireless bill.
C: (0.986%) T: Sorry Kim. You're full of üí©. "O follow Elizabeth Warren". Maybe you shouldn't have taken so many indoctrination classes in school. But I do love Des Moines. Hopefullt5, you're.kind won't fk it up. https://t.co/SVIDUax7wj
