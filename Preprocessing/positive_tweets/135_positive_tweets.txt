C: (0.992%) T: @alecjacobs They want to sponsor a video and,by god, they‚Äôre gonna sponsor one. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúRace riots caused by Elizabeth Warren??!?‚Äù and its 5 hours long.
C: (1.000%) T: I have my share of disagreements with Elizabeth Warren‚Äîfewer with her than any other candidate, but that's not the point I want to make right now. My point is that disagreements aside, I am genuinely excited about her as the potential leader of this country. [Thread.]
C: (1.000%) T: @itai_halevi @davidmweissman @seanhannity ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£the Dayton Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, yeah freaking right, Never vote Democrat.
C: (0.976%) T: As soon as news broke that the Dayton shooter espoused socialist views, supported Elizabeth Warren, hated ICE, supported Antifa, and had conversations with journalists sympathetic to Antifa, the story of Dayton has all but disappeared from the headlines. It's not a coincidence. https://t.co/40l0Q8G2hg
C: (1.000%) T: @InCastamere @PurpleReign14 Elizabeth Warren is so white she didn't notice a generation of gay men were dying, but she got a lab experiment in the failure of trickle down economics
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Disagree. Elizabeth Warren is for common sense gun reform. She is also not followed, praised and quoted by white supremacists.
C: (0.987%) T: @MotherJones What about the Trump hating Democrat terrorist in Dayton Ohio?  The one Elizabeth Warren inspired to kill.
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Let's play an Elizabeth Warren campaign rally right next to a Trump rally and see if we can spot the differences, shall we???
C: (0.983%) T: @ChuckCallesto If she uses that premise then Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton. He was a supporter of hers. @AOC is such a lunkhead.
C: (0.981%) T: The Dayton shooter's last tweet on Aug 3 said ‚ÄúMillennials have a message for the Joe Biden generation: hurry up and die.‚Äù He also retweeted messages supporting Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  Doesn't he know Biden's 'generation' would include THEM?  #DemocratsAreDumb
C: (0.996%) T: @crich00777 @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends The Dayton shooter supported socialist causes and was a supporter of presidential candidate Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Doesn't sound like a trump supporter to me.
C: (1.000%) T: @erinturmelle @CoryBooker Guess what? You are not required to go. Are you going to call for Elizabeth Warren to quit campaigning because of the Ohio shooting? What about Bernie? It may be a booker supporter next. This is just the lefts latest rhetoric.
C: (1.000%) T: Poll: Dems say Warren reigned in second primary debates https://t.co/h1pq2N8sVm
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren was a great and wonderful teacher. But can she become America's Teacher in Chief?  https://t.co/7YsIqIPJuJ
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren The shooters and ANTIFA style activists support Elizabeth Warren.  She‚Äôs just another sock puppet following her NWO marching orders.  I‚Äôm sure the sleeper cells all get their marching orders from the same sources. https://t.co/FD8l6Hisyc
C: (1.000%) T: ‚Äú‚ÄòNobody wants to be talked down to‚Äînobody.‚Ä¶Good teaching is about starting where you are and the teacher having the confidence in you to know‚Ä¶if you thought about this from a little different perspective, you might move a little bit.‚Äô‚Äù https://t.co/vy33IgUzE2 HT @Ben_Alpers
C: (1.000%) T: @Shahryar @QueenInYeIIow Absolutely correct, I would like to add that the federal government should also remove itself from the student loan business entirely.   https://t.co/wGXnASSSER
C: (1.000%) T: @senatemajldr Read Elizabeth Warren's plans to protect us from gun violence. #MassacreMoscowMitch You have to act on behalf of the vast majority of people who want action. She has the plans! https://t.co/ukhhyGdFhE
C: (1.000%) T: The same people who believe Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide also believe in Trump/Russia collusion, that Crooked Hillary is honest, that Big Mike is a woman, and that Elizabeth Warren is really a Native American.
C: (1.000%) T: Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%. https://t.co/aBnMheEqmT via @HuffPostPol
C: (0.977%) T: Please don‚Äôt let this stop her from becoming president! Elizabeth Warren Made One Mistake and Will Never Be President Because of It https://t.co/o8x3C4Onld
C: (1.000%) T: New favorite fair moment. Got caught in a swell of people and ended up next to Elizabeth Warren. A woman I have admired for a really long time. And me and the others around me laughed and‚Ä¶ https://t.co/dooOGCIY6c
C: (0.998%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Y‚Äôall are like whiny schoolchildren.  Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt go out and encourage her supporters to ‚Äúbeat the crap out of them‚Äù or ‚Äúcarry them out on a stretcher‚Äù, does she?  #GOPTraitor
C: (0.983%) T: @KamalaHarris, "he‚Äôs certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.‚Äù  Democrats in Iowa Offer Plans to Combat Gun Violence https://t.co/N5o08mJbLr
C: (1.000%) T: @CindyPeak @KatieHill4CA @AOC @POTUS @ewarren The POTUS has directly targeted AOC saying she hates America and should go back where she came from. Elizabeth Warren targeted the Dayton shooters sister and the random night club he shot up?
