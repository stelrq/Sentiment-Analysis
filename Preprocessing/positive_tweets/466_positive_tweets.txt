C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren You‚Äôre a real POS.  Elizabeth Warren supports criminals over cops.  She supports illegal immigrants over veterans.  She lied about being Native American in order to further her own career.  In essence, she‚Äôs a POS!  #HandsUpDontShootHoax #BlueLivesMatter #WalkAwayFromDemocrats üñïüèº https://t.co/DtUXxKOeDP
C: (1.000%) T: You think you know your candidate smh, just found out today Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt circumcised. You lost my vote today Elizabeth Warren #FeelTheBern
C: (1.000%) T: Trump "has given aid and comfort to white supremacists" and "done the wink and a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. He's done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country," Warren said. https://t.co/mx1MKBDc6v

C: (0.995%) T: @jennycohn1 @resistbot @senatemajldr Definitely Elizabeth Warren. LOL. Just kidding. We need paper ballots.
C: (1.000%) T: Kamala Harris gets some standees, mostly not. Audience does like her point that we are at an inflection point, that we are better than this. But back to more polite than excited so far in the speech. So far Pete is applause leader, but Elizabeth Warren still to come. #IACaucus

C: (0.998%) T: Elizabeth Warren babbles on and on  about this guy like he was a totally innocent victim  You don't hear her talking about the death of Seth rich do you? Now there was an innocent guy minding his own business that got shot.. but you won't hear Democrats talking about that Why? https://t.co/gYTexMBfB9
C: (1.000%) T: So, when Elizabeth Warren &amp; AOC tell you that we can have all of this free shit and the 'evil rich' will pay for it, just remember the past and know that tomorrow's 'evil rich' might just include you.  Either they are hopelessly naive or flatout liars.
C: (0.767%) T: With Sleepy Joe being taken out by his own gaffs and Kamala Harris (we need a nickname for her) being taken out by Tulsi Gabbard and this 91 year old, combined with the fact Elizabeth Warren is just a friggin' loon, Crazy Bernie is backing his way into the nomination. #Landslide https://t.co/KD93M55iyO
C: (1.000%) T: It seems like it was just a year ago Curt Schilling was planning to challenge Elizabeth Warren in MA for her Senate seat. Now he‚Äôs running for Congress in AZ. Seems legit.
C: (1.000%) T: Everything about Elizabeth Warren screams extremism. Green New Deal, slavery reparations, free college, forgiving all student loans. You will have to pay over 200% of your pay in order to finance everything she is promising. https://t.co/VEmA3FK9hI

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is not any better than Joe Biden and the rest of the the neoliberals since she is obviously insincere.
C: (0.850%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a better take on this. Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/tnFEY6zqoz
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi, and Hillary Clinton have all supported the protestors in Hong Kong. Donald Trump has not!   We have spineless president that doesn‚Äôt stand up for democracy but says dictators are great people. That has to change in 2020. #HongKong
C: (1.000%) T: She's not getting enough positive press. Look at her face and body language when she saw Elizabeth Warren, the kids she talks to on the trail.  She is real, personable, and most importantly,  tough as nails. She's just warming up. https://t.co/UROWtn6DUk
C: (0.988%) T: @THEHermanCain How does Elizabeth Warren get elected? Fake ballots?
C: (1.000%) T: @JoyceWhiteVance Elizabeth Warren n a Democratic Congress will start CPR. Don't call TOD yet.
C: (1.000%) T: @ViperAggressor @hollandcourtney @ChrisCuomo @DonaldJTrumpJr So then, by this logic, when Trump calls Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas, it is actually a direct insult to Native Americans. So, you admit that Trump is racist.  Right?
C: (1.000%) T: The weird thing about that Rebecca Traister article about Elizabeth Warren's teaching is how much it relegates Warren's class origins to the background.
C: (1.000%) T: @Clarknt67 @matttogni Oh, come on. Biden isn‚Äôt the only one running, and way too many Sanders supporters are already saying they won‚Äôt vote for *anyone* else in November ‚Äî not even Elizabeth Warren. Don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs about only about not wanting to vote for senile old men.
