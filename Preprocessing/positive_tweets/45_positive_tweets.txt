C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to invest an additional $200 billion in rural communities to boost population, add new jobs and place a focus on sustainable practices that would increase farmers' pay, according to a new plan she has released. https://t.co/PrIsIuL5Nl
C: (0.697%) T: @robreiner What about the slaughter in Ohio in the name of Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Dayton shooter wasn't hanging on to Trump's words. Pretty sure it was Elizabeth Warren and Antifa.
C: (1.000%) T: This kind of stuff, and what Elizabeth Warren tweeted following the El Paso shooting, and the million other things progressives have said against Fox will result in someone crazy doing something awful. If rhetoric matters, all rhetoric matters.
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN How about Antifa? The Ohio shooter was a leftist, supported Antifa, and liked Elizabeth Warren. I agree the El Paso shooter seems to have been a Nazi. Anyway, how do you explain this? https://t.co/vEOjUNo5BO

C: (0.983%) T: @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson You don‚Äôt want UNITY. You proved that this morning with you tweet regarding Elizabeth Warren. Did the Dayton murderer shoot up a bank?  You‚Äôre already off to your divisive speech. You didn‚Äôt write your TelePrompTer speech. Lest we forget your nasty Beto tweet last night. Shut-up
C: (0.904%) T: @devindwyer @ABCPolitics @realDonaldTrump @CommStout @ABCNewsLive That's childish. The other shooter in Ohio was a Elizabeth Warren supporter should we blame her. 47,000 suicides in 2017 that problem needs attention. 24 mass shootings under Obama over 200 murdered is that his fault. Stop dividing ppl. This post just adds fuel
C: (1.000%) T: Oh, Elizabeth Warren, please use your intelligence, your heart, and MORAL courage to act for the good of all people.  Please look bey https://t.co/3VZUbKNgh8
C: (0.723%) T: @TimRyan @TimRyan @RepTimRyan AND...Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren call for more violence against conservatives  https://t.co/lZLXpVdurk
C: (1.000%) T: @tonyschwartz You can only support the Dems if you like to kill babies, hate Jews, hate cops, white ppl, and support the terrorist organization of Antifa of which the Ohio shooter supported. He also supported Elizabeth Warren so she is responsible for that shooting.
C: (0.972%) T: @KikiAdine @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends @BarackObama It means the same thing. But stupidity is among all of you uneducated democrats  ELIZABETH WARREN was behind the one shooter. He praised her and the democrats üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
C: (1.000%) T: NEW PODCAST: Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders seemed to almost work in tandem during #DemDebate2 ‚Äì but will it last into the next round? @elliott_brennan shares his thoughts with @2020VisionCast. Listen here: https://t.co/ZMOaeyiOs7 https://t.co/LZE8Nkd80u

C: (1.000%) T: @keith_vartanian @chrisdelia @ewarren @BernieSanders @BarackObama Trump was not responsible in ANY way for the shooting. Just like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders weren't. That is all. I gotta get back to work brotha. If you're ever in STL holler and we can roll.
C: (1.000%) T: And all of this raises a serious question: how does Elizabeth Warren become a better candidate for black voters? Is there a blind spot in her platform? https://t.co/KRkBO2qCzj
C: (0.582%) T: @charliekirk11 Nitwit, total fuckjn nitwit. When‚Äôs the last time Elizabeth warren called anyone a name, advocated violence against anyone or made an obscene jester - yeah never
C: (1.000%) T: @GopTired @margarita_wine I'm not sure how you can think Kamala Harris doesn't have the experience but Elizabeth Warren does.  Harris has experience in the executive and legislative branches, and has experience at the federal, state, and local levels.
C: (1.000%) T: @kasek_15 @Ronnie97098924 @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump Only 7 Mexicans were killed out of 33. His manifesto tells that he wanted to decrease population for environmental reasons.  Dayton killer targeted his sister, but was a Democrat who supported Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: It may be true that we don‚Äôt want a president who asks us to do homework. But we might want one who manages to see in us, somehow, potential.  DAMMIT!!!  https://t.co/pMwUnKKTiY via @thecut

C: (1.000%) T: @BudMeyers99 Did Nan mention his love for Antifa or proclaimed support of Elizabeth Warren, nope. Just another hack politician trying to score political points. Shame. Wake up America, the Democrats have a saying ‚Äúlet no good tragedy go to waist.‚Äù Shame on them.
