C: (1.000%) T: @Samantha55325 @sandyhook Why are you lying?  Elizabeth Warren has no hate speech for Americans . She knows Trump is the hater and gladly says so. What did she say EXACTLY THAT INCITED VIOLENCE? We all know Trumps hate matched the El Paso shooters hate. Give me facts .
C: (0.989%) T: @Frank_N_Meems @seanhannity The fault lies with the person who pulled the trigger! By the way I'm not a member of a tribe.  Check with Elizabeth Warren on that subject.
C: (1.000%) T: @RoArquette I am part Indian (unlike Elizabeth Warren) so send some of your wealth to me for reparations of what you pale-faces did to the Cherokee. No, you will just be a hypocrite and try to be politically correct (in your eyes) and hopefully become relevant again. Who is @RoArquette?
C: (1.000%) T: @FirstPREMIERSD is a predatory lender üò¨ 36% interest rate on a credit card? With a $79 annual fee and no rewards? That's fucked up. Pretty sure Elizabeth Warren would ban you from operating in the US. #Predator #bank
C: (0.997%) T: @mdub0360 @CST_soxvan @Suntimes Elizabeth Warren is proof
C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren The Ohio shooter was a bigger supporter of you " Elizabeth Warren "
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren will win I just know it
C: (0.583%) T: @whyulying10 @AdrianNormanDC Has Elizabeth Warren EVER used rhetoric and vitriol to inflame her supporters to denounce huge groups of people, calling them less than human, an infestation, like Dotard has? Has Joe Biden? Kamala Harris? Bernie Sanders? Barack Obama? No. ONE man has, and it's this POS üëá https://t.co/be0CCBYtBr
C: (1.000%) T: Can you believe this dumb woman said something this stupid.Having an abortion is murdering a life inside you and it is not like having having your tonsils removed!Do you really want this woman to be a President of our Country?Sicko1111 https://t.co/AD3lOMuEmj
C: (0.715%) T: @EspuelasVox @realDonaldTrump Why don't you comment on the Ohio shooting?   Connor  Betts  supports illegal immigration and would vote for Bernie Sanders/ Elizabeth Warren.   You guys are so dishonest!!
C: (1.000%) T: It is hard to believe that there are people that are willing to vote for someone like Elizabeth Warren that compares abortion to "Getting your tonsils out" #Trump2020 #KAG https://t.co/CSgNBcpuPV
C: (1.000%) T: @everything_says @ImpeachTrump012 @realDonaldTrump And the other mass shooter was a follower of Elizabeth Warren and a Democrat.  Using the Dem line of thinking, she's responsible for that one.  It's crazy, isn't it?
C: (0.792%) T: @effiedog I'd take him.  I like Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @Pop3Pam @TheOfficerTatum If you know who is doing the violence why do these attacks keep happening. This weekend was a prime example of Evil not discriminating. One shooter was alt-right the other supported socialism and Elizabeth Warren. Mental illness doesn‚Äôt care about political party
C: (1.000%) T: @larryelder @KamalaHarris Maybe she deserves the pinochle name along with little Elizabeth Warren. This is all the democrats have. Just call you a racist or some other name because they can‚Äôt win on her socialist ideology.
C: (1.000%) T: @MLundholm08 Same. Also I only donated to Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, so glad to see I‚Äôm in good company re the data.
C: (0.997%) T: @ewarren is obviously mental-murdering a BABY is NOT like "getting your tonsils out" you  psycho!  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever  #BabiesMatter  #ProLife   Elizabeth Warren Compared Abortion to ‚ÄúGetting Your Tonsils Out‚Äù https://t.co/znQXNE7dSw
C: (1.000%) T: He was one of your own he likes Elizabeth Warren hey Rob I hope you‚Äôre ready for  4 More Years all you socialists make believe everything is the President‚Äôs fault 4 More Years Rob https://t.co/IoYqB1PpxN
C: (1.000%) T: @ScottWa13282023 @TheGreaterWatt @MattPalumbo12 @jaredlholt well if "women are invading" and "women are fundamentally transforming america and destroying it's culture" were planks of like, Elizabeth Warren's campaign platform y'all would almost have something resembling a point in this dumbass false equivalency you're attempting to draw.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren proposes 'public option for broadband' https://t.co/4X3KNxWPey https://t.co/1pTXtEEvik
C: (1.000%) T: @Deena_Zaru The dumb ass brainwashed dummycrats. Repeat a lie often enough and they believe it. Is Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Dayton shooting? Of course not. Neither is Trump for El Paso.
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol @gtconway3d We all deserve Elizabeth Warren, and I hope we get her.
C: (0.595%) T: @RedGia @JulianCastro Gia. Your worries hurt our hearts. My hope hangs on the strength of people like Elijah Cummings and Beto, Julian Castro, Elizabeth Warren...all the others of us who fight for Justice. Fear will not defeat us. The vulnerable will be protected.
C: (1.000%) T: I like Warren a lot but I don't think this shows her teaching in a very good light. I wouldn't say that cold-calling and this "assumpsit" question are good pedagogy. https://t.co/LAvLaXBQr2
C: (0.987%) T: @Ceablock @BadAsVlad @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN Sigh. I‚Äôm in Dayton. The shooter WAS a leftist. Supported Elizabeth Warren and socialism and wasn‚Äôt shy about it.
