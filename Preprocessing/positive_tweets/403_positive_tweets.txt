C: (1.000%) T: @Pappiness Sounds to me like ‚Äúthe system is rigged‚Äù - who always says that, oh yeah Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: I was Bernie supporter beginning in 2015 bc he was best available option at the time. Better candidates (Elizabeth Warren &amp; @AndrewYang) have since emerged. They have better solutions, are more likely to survive &amp; have not been career politicians for last 4 decades #MyBernieStory
C: (1.000%) T: It‚Äôs between her or Elizabeth Warren... if we keepin it a bean... and for people that don‚Äôt actually look into the candidates but follow what‚Äôs given to you, don‚Äôt vote for Bernie or Joe... both them niggas old and not gon do a lick of shit for black people https://t.co/i7dAXiVT4z
C: (1.000%) T: The dispelling of a trope, by ‚Å¶@DavidAFrench‚Å©; who also took the time to read the Obama Justice Department findings from its investigation into the Mike Brown shooting ‚Äî Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Lied about Ferguson &amp; Michael Brown | National Review https://t.co/v2YZau2m0C
C: (0.715%) T: Thread.  If you read nothing else this evening read this.   They is no difference between Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump in economic policy. https://t.co/nF5gE6OH05
C: (1.000%) T: @RWPUSA @ewarren @JoeBiden @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren has jumped on to Bernie's boat because she saw the support for the policies he has been speaking on for 20 years.  Why drink #BernieLight when you can have the real thing?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren released her plan to protect communities from gun violence. She'll break the NRA's stronghold on Congress, ban assault weapons &amp; enforce universal background checks in her first 100 days. &amp; she'll finally hold the gun industry accountable for the harm it causes.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Hate ?  Elizabeth Warren ?  You are one very confused individual and should NOT drink anymore of the kool aid. üòú
C: (0.985%) T: Elizabeth Warren passed Bernie to become 2nd in the polls and people are losing it.... no self inflicted wounds fellow Democrats.... let‚Äôs not lose because of self righteousness. https://t.co/4KF6d1B7FA
C: (1.000%) T: @radahs71 @nprpolitics Me. Warren isn't the brightest bulb in the box. She talks a lot; but like Obama she's either lying or simply more drivel.  Whatever, Elizabeth Warren is another liberal clown. Lying on the employment application for Harvard claiming she's a Native American. That takes real nerve.
C: (1.000%) T: @lvl28mage @JustErics @kaicee118 @2020Delegates All of this hyperbole is not helping. Who in their right mind would want abuse from the people they‚Äôd might support in a primary? This is why I actually like Elizabeth Warren, there‚Äôs less of ‚Äúthis.‚Äù

C: (1.000%) T: If I printed a hundred bumper stickers that said Elizabeth Warren is a socialist  1. Do you think I would be able to recoup my cost?  2. could this message have unintended consequences by attracting new voters to her base?  #bernie2020 #beto2020 #yangGang #teamPete #DNC
C: (1.000%) T: @FiveThirtyEight Most human beings don't consider abusing children and women a sign of masculinity, thank God for that. The only thing masculine on President Trump is the size of his diapers. Elizabeth Warren could take him with one arm tied behind her back.
C: (1.000%) T: @jonathansmucker Stacey Abrams would absolutely knock it out of the park! I‚Äôd love to see Elizabeth Warren as Bernie‚Äôs VP pick as well.
C: (1.000%) T: @FiveThirtyEight I‚Äôm sure Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are shaking in their boots.
C: (1.000%) T: @kburton40 @ewarren please further note that this reactionary antifeminist blocked us for saying that elizabeth warren is, in fact, not doing man genocide.
C: (1.000%) T: @NastyWoman1012 @TheWarrenWing @ewarren I support Elizabeth Warren not because she is a woman but because she is the most qualified for the Presidency.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Doubles Down, Repeats Charlottesville Hoax Cherokee woman warren! What a joke, this woman can never bet trusted!  https://t.co/9rlaK3gZYW

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is only taking donations from us - the grassroots.   She's working harder than any other candidate to get out &amp; be w/ the people.   She's not interested the moneyed interests - they'll never be her constituents!   https://t.co/kWW9YjpSb2 . #Warren2020
