C: (1.000%) T: @battletested5 Bolth shooters were leftists Dayton loved Elizabeth Warren and social media sites changed political affiliation of supposed el paso shooter
C: (1.000%) T: @flopperdog @kearisbear @JMcGuireMLB @FrankConniff You can't tell the difference between Bernie Sanders, who is endorsed by the DSA, and Elizabeth Warren, who applauded Trump's promise that the US would never be socialist. Have you considered that they may be more different than you realize?
C: (1.000%) T: @radical_am @AmyWall45847796 @patrickalbanese @LarrySchweikart @JoaquinCastrotx Was the Dayton shooters inspired by Elizabeth Warren ?? Youre looking very big goofy.
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Now do the Elizabeth Warren supporting mass murderer in Dayton.
C: (1.000%) T: My bucket list: #1: Meet @AOC and have her sign me so I can get it tattooed  #2: High five Bernie  #3: Thank Elizabeth Warren for her service, in person, while also calling her mom
C: (0.598%) T: @DailyCaller And elizabeth warren is a white idiot
C: (1.000%) T: @bigbluesweater The Ohio shooter was a socialist Elizabeth Warren supporter and Antifa member. Also, look for Randy Stair, your very own transgender shooter  The shooter's ideology is a red herring. People do shootings for the most varied reasons
C: (0.989%) T: @kylegriffin1 Elizabeth Warren for President. Not just for the post, but periodt.
C: (0.995%) T: I will now vote for @ewarren Elizabeth Warren Calls Trump a White Supremacist - The New York Times https://t.co/Xhfwjfg4FG via @GoogleNews
C: (0.982%) T: @ImJuliCaldwell @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a deep-red socialist. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @wesleyamullins @ewarren It's so weird you'd mention those things bc Elizabeth Warren has a plan to address ALL OF THEM.
C: (1.000%) T: @JustSumGuy176 @tatereeves @USAttyHurst @realDonaldTrump What about the Elizabeth Warren Dem supporting Ohio shooter?? Was he a white nationalist too?? Please this White supremacist B.S. is a joke. Do you even know a White supremacist?? I never have. Dems are reaching for anything.#DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
C: (1.000%) T: @HardballChris just said older, white, poorer women, like me, favor Joe Biden. That richer, educated, liberals favor Elizabeth Warren.  I like both but lean towards Joe. I'm trying hard to keep an open mind - don't want to vote based on my age, race, etc.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @emrazz Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is native American. I said yes. She has high cheek bones.
C: (0.541%) T: @robreiner Ok Meathead sooo the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren robot so should she resign from her candidacy? See your logic makes no sense moron!!! @realDonaldTrump @ewarren
C: (1.000%) T: @alimhaider "Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is an indian chief.  I said yes."

Trump is also the only one that has the alt-right cyber-terrorist and murderous terroristic terrorist regime, and no one else. Never mind the fact that Elizabeth Warren isn't in the Oval Office RIGHT NOW! trump is &amp; he WILL go in handcuffs
C: (1.000%) T: This is a pretty great profile of Elizabeth Warren and makes me like her a lot! https://t.co/bhQAyclx3T
C: (1.000%) T: It looks like Bernie Sanders has an active engaged alliance w tulsi gabbard and Beto ORourke. And maybe a truce with Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a con artist who lied about her ethnicity to get a better paying job. I said yes.

C: (1.000%) T: It’s time to address mental health issues. Let’s start with Elizabeth Warren and Alyssa Milano. They shouldn’t be alone in this battle for their sanity. Make a difference. Tell a liberal you care about them getting better. https://t.co/EIEt32HV0Q
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is pushing Socialism who will  categorize us based on race, tax tax tax, and try to run our lives.  https://t.co/b9jxYhQWF3
