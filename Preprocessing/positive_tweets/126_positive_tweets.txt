C: (0.999%) T: @TrishaaLoo @JammieWF @ewarren You're completely wrong on Dayton Ohio the Dayton Ohio shooter mention Elizabeth Warren and others that he supported
C: (1.000%) T: @districtdiatric @EricPerless I don't see the issue if it's formulaic. If you replace Elizabeth Warren with X candidate its then targeted to the audience that you want to reach. So lecture me about who I follow, but it's certainly more extensive than the AU bubble, they are just substantially more vocal.
