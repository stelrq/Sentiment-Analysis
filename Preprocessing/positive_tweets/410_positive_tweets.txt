C: (1.000%) T: @PoliticalShort @SebGorka All law enforcement should be focused on wiping out ms 13 in their districts.  They are the most vile and viscous creatures.  Trump wants them out and to keep others from coming in. Elizabeth Warren, AOC,  ... they don't care . Just open the borders and let anyone in. Murderers!

C: (0.547%) T: @digby56 I‚Äôm 68. It‚Äôs gotta be either Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris. Men have been f&amp;@*ing up for centuries. Give us a chance. We can‚Äôt do any worse than these preceding fools.
C: (1.000%) T: * @Warren has a new plan to reduce gun violence by 80 percent https://t.co/XReCS1YImy " But Warren‚Äôs plan goes further than the typical Dem proposals, which are mostly focused on universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, to start moving America in that direction."
C: (1.000%) T: Best three things that happened at the fair today: 1) Hearing people boo Elizabeth Warren 2) A gal saying how she could feel the dark forces of the demons from the Slipknot fans 3) Refer to the photo below. https://t.co/ziET498cTC
C: (1.000%) T: @SenatorDurbin What about the Elizabeth warren fan in Dayton?
C: (1.000%) T: Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%. https://t.co/314CH7fjaE via @HuffPostPol
C: (1.000%) T: @kylegriffin1 @GoldenGirlsRu Reading this article only confirms what I've know all along. Elizabeth Warren is as much an American treasure as is President Obama. It will be my great honor to vote for her in the primary and again in the general.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. https://t.co/3T6xLOlL8H
C: (1.000%) T: @WolvesUnited3 Have you read the Federalist article on  accelerationists? This EXACTLY what Elizabeth Warren is doing here &amp; Democrat leaders have been doing. They are falsely ramping things up for a RESET.  It‚Äôs a must read!  https://t.co/D3eER0THkQ
C: (1.000%) T: @PaulLeeTicks @RealCandaceO While you're sitting, what do you suppose the Elizabeth Warren supporter was inspired by in Dayton!? Now, #SITDOWN #hypocrisy #DoubleStandards maybe it was her dulcet, uncivil, screaming racism every chance she and ALL Democrats get!? #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #BuildTheWall

C: (1.000%) T: @chrisjoosse @PaulLeeTicks @ProudResister @EmmaKinery @Scairp114 Yeah my twitter feed is filled with my rants against Elizabeth Warren üôÑ
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC Funny you say that.  The last mass shooters are/were liberal socialists and Elizabeth Warren supporters.
C: (1.000%) T: "Elizabeth Warren is¬†rising in the polls¬†and has a high-quality campaign organization, but doubts linger in some quarters about the appeal of her left-leaning policies in a general election."  The only ones who actually express those doubts are folks like @mviser. https://t.co/247fxlUkdL
C: (1.000%) T: Three mass murderers buy three different rifles at three different mom and pop gun stores. One shoots up a WalMart, one shoots up a bar, one shoots up a festival.  Elizabeth Warren- ‚ÄúWal-Mart needs to stop selling guns‚Äù.  Yep.  @NRA @ewarren
C: (1.000%) T: @gurglingdragon Since when is purple in Elizabeth Warren's campaign color palette?  If anything, this is Kamala's.
C: (0.691%) T: Wonder what they would call me I'm half American Indian and half German? ( Not the same tribe Elizabeth Warren came from) https://t.co/1nFZm0RqQc
C: (1.000%) T: I don't like made up antagonism about whether Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren has precedence, as if first is the issue. They're both compelling. Let's read the plans. https://t.co/HFI55yHvzw
C: (0.994%) T: Typical...if you cant legislate the 2nd Amendment away, why just tax the crap out of it. Because bad guys don't want to pay taxes right. #TaxationIsTheft   https://t.co/idPz2ieRK5
C: (1.000%) T: @allinwithchris @MSNBC @RepEscobar @chrislhayes Number one cable show in America in time slot sets the country straight.  Let's talk about DAYTON, The nut was a huge Left wing crazy...
