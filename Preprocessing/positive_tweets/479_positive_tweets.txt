C: (1.000%) T: @nycsouthpaw Opinion: Should we trust Mitch McConnell on porches?  I know Elizabeth Warren likes them, though.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to reduce firearm deaths by 80%. Here's her plan to do it. https://t.co/P1kjW7jMWC via @DMRegister  &gt;&gt; Only 80%? Why not 100% if her plan is that good?
C: (1.000%) T: @InitiateSarcasm @TheJoshLarson @hanieldann @TimHansenisu @AOC Ok what about all the killings in Chicago and Baltimore?  We’re all of them done by supposed white supremacy?  Also the elpasso shooter was a very strong environmentalist and the one in Dayton supported Elizabeth Warren!  So where does white supremacy stand?  On the left!
C: (1.000%) T: @tedlieu @Walmart Truth is  Elizabeth Warren made a young man who was a socialist and PASSED background checks to legally buy a gun to kill in Dayton  The democrats inaction on the border made a registered DEMOCRAT kill in El Paso because of illegal aliens and his gun was bought legally
C: (1.000%) T: Epstein "kills himself" on suicide watch after documents are ordered unsealed https://t.co/nnqR7J4rYD  Yet people still trust the government is here to help and want them to take our guns https://t.co/Oec1mLBHYQ  Via the TAPS act H.R. 838 right now which is 100% unconstitutional
C: (1.000%) T: The thing about Elizabeth Warren is that she doesn’t have nebulous policy proposals. She’s got actual ideas and she’s got a plan to implement them.  I know it’s still early days in this race, but she’s been the most impressive Democratic candidate thus far. https://t.co/suZUW2sxhk
C: (1.000%) T: @delsuite @ResisterSiano @twendi66 Elizabeth Warren. If she were a man would be the top contender. Follow her, just for a week you will see why I say this.  They all have plans. But how do they pay for these plans? She will tell you. Bernie poor Bernie. He has a recording inside him.

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren, champion of false information. Never let the facts get in the way of your agenda. You failed Mass. And you'll fail the U.S.
C: (1.000%) T: @QTAnon1 @A1ABeachfrontAv @ewarren Painstakingly careful genealogical research proved that Elizabeth Warren is 100% full-blooded PhoNee, so I think you owe her an apology.

C: (1.000%) T: This is NOT RUSSIA! You may think you're gangster oligarchs like Putin and his friends but you are NOT! Elizabeth Warren did NOT have the "biggest crowd at the Iowa State Fair" BERNIE SANDERS truly did. https://t.co/6aHJS1TuTk

C: (1.000%) T: @HawaiiDelilah I’m on the Elizabeth Warren team. Biden is just a foot in the mouth waiting to happen. We all knew this when he was VP but we forgot. Although - I’ll vote for him if that’s what everyone wants. I only hope he’ll pick someone like Harris as his VP.
C: (1.000%) T: @4everNeverTrump @NateSilver538 @wendybyrdm Bernie is just a terrible national candidate, and he knee-capped himself by hounding Hillary for months after he'd clearly lost to her.  We'll all breathe a bit easier after he gracefully bows out this time and throws his support behind Elizabeth Warren, our next President.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Wow...what you won’t say to try to get a vote. Dictionary: Panderer = Elizabeth Warren (aka: Pocahontas)
