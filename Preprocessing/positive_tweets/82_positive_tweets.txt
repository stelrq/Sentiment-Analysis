C: (1.000%) T: @GOPChairwoman SO you are telling Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are spot on then? Because we know, I mean we definitely know the GOP will remove the coverage for Pre-existing conditions
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow What's the Native American word for "panderer"? (I do know that there are many Native American languages, But I don't know which one Elizabeth Warren isn't.
C: (1.000%) T: @tweetelissa Really recommend this read - gives context to her method of politics and discusses concerns of her being a ‚Äúknow-it-all.‚Äù She‚Äôs a teacher through and through. https://t.co/pKJQBYEPRw
C: (1.000%) T: I'd sue if I were that policeman. Brown muscling around that tiny Asian store owner on video is a winner. https://t.co/Ul0oqm5pF5

C: (1.000%) T: @johnreichardwes @NewYorker @staceyabrams @jelani9 I totally agree with you and would love to vote for a ticket with Stacey Abrams and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.988%) T: @maggieNYT Okay, now do the Ohio shooter and his support for Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: In other words, NYT creates violence against conservatives by blaming conservatives for violence.  The Dayton Killer echoed the words of progressives and loved Elizabeth Warren but NYT didn't have enough space to cover that story. https://t.co/xkv04Ai2v6
C: (0.985%) T: Sen. Bernie Sanders has received over $200,000 from Pittsburgh-area donors.  The second-highest recipient, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has received just less than $130,000. https://t.co/ublykvvsC3
C: (1.000%) T: @iknownothingok @ResisterSiano I like Elizabeth Warren. I think she absolutely should be included in the next administration in some significant capacity, regardless of who is on ticket.
C: (1.000%) T: @MericDunn @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump @GOP @Mediaite And the Dayton shooter was a full on Democrat that LOVED Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA...so that must mean Elizabeth Warren must of inspired THAT shooting..your post is irrelevant if you won't say the same about the the Dayton shooter...

C: (1.000%) T: @Fiorella_im No to Elizabeth Warren,  this is why Tulsi Gabbard is the real progressive.
C: (1.000%) T: @robertdunlap947 @barmore27 It's funny how many non-Americans are breaking the necks to get in to this country of such injustice. Also strange that white people like Elizabeth Warren and Blotto O'Rourke invent non-white ancestry or adopt non-white names to further their careers ...
C: (1.000%) T: Initially, I thought Warren too old to be president. Then I realized, she is EXACTLY what this country needs: a brilliant, ethical, politically savvy Mother figure. Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/UilPdW1jDz #warren2020
C: (1.000%) T: @SpeakerPelosi Great!

C: (1.000%) T: Very smart person Erik "Eric" Erickson thinks Donals Trump, the president of the United States, shouldn't be held to a higher standard than Elizabeth Warren. Y'know... the same people who have said we have to grade Trump on a curve for years. https://t.co/BEOGDMijdm
