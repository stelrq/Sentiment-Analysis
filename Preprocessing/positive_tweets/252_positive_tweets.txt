C: (1.000%) T: 18/ Rhetoric: Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren tweeted Friday about Michael Brown's "murder" by a white policeman. This is years after the evidence conclusively showed that Brown was the aggressor from start to finish and that the officer acted in self-defense.
C: (1.000%) T: From @NRO's @DavidAFrench: "They flat-out spread fiction, libeled an innocent man, &amp; stoked American divisions‚Äîall for political gain.. complexity does not mean there aren‚Äôt simple obligations that attach to every politician, activist, &amp; mmbr of the media https://t.co/9Wr3zhd6FE

C: (1.000%) T: This ignoramus will never be POTUS.   Bought my daughter a new hammerless revolver as her new CC today. Now I have peace of mind since a lot of businesses are being robbed around her salon. She's at the shooting range right now!‚ù£  https://t.co/viqd7GywsL
C: (0.963%) T: A ridiculous no. of people accused me of attempted murder, including blue checkmark twitter activists &amp; @timjacobwise on @MSNBC. I was the victim of the Living or Napping While Black Hate Crime Hoax @Yale, &amp; I had been terrorized in my own home for months. https://t.co/EUxM4F8oLb

C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/jBm3ywbpRT  @ewarren knows full well that the U.S. DOJ, at that time headed by Eric Holder, a black man, completely cleared the officer of any wrongdoing in the shooting of Michael Brown.  No doubt she is saying this simply to get votes.
C: (0.865%) T: @timjacobwise Tim Wise:  "I dont get the vitriol"  "Infighting is bad"  Also Tim Wise:  "Trump is ripping parents from children &amp; inspiring terrorism so let me..."  *checks notes*  "... attack Elizabeth Warren for having a broadband plan."
C: (1.000%) T: Former Missouri Dem lawmaker, retired officer blasts Warren for tweet claiming Michael Brown was murdered  https://t.co/BsFjQ5QUYi  #pocohontas is just another lying Lib who doesn't know the Truth &amp; doesn't try to tell it. Her lie makes it a better story to impress her followers.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepAlGreen Hey Al, why aren't you talking about the Ohio shooting? Could it be because that wacko was a progressive liberal that would have voted for Elizabeth Warren? Liked the green new deal? You #Hypocrite
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, respectively, are lawyers.  If they were giving sworn testimony;  given the official record, would either of them say that "Michael Brown was murdered" while under oath? @ewarren @SenKamalaHarris
