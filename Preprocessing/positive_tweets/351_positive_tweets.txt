C: (1.000%) T: @RudyGiuliani Here is your boss spreading love Rudy.   President Trump: "The Dayton situation, he was a fan of Antifa. He was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Nothing to do with Trump, but nobody ever mentions that."
C: (0.697%) T: @robreiner How about the slaughter in Dayton in the name of Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @Melxtex @BeautyBind @NewKindOfPol @washingtonpost This is reminiscent of how the media has covered Trump and Elizabeth Warren. She'd release a new policy and Trump would go on a Twitter tirade. But instead of reporting on Warren's policy (you know, actual news), they'd focus on him calling her Pocahontas. It's poor journalism.
C: (1.000%) T: Easier said than done - we've heard it before.... nevertheless, 👍 plan. "The White House contender wants to make sure every U.S. home has a fiber broadband connection at an affordable cost." https://t.co/dAtlzw684D
C: (1.000%) T: @Fishstikks @CBSNews Lol he is something else dosent mention el paso but jumps to Dayton and says the shooter was a bernie Sanders and elizabeth Warren fan and not a fan of his.....wtf is right lol this world is so screwed
C: (1.000%) T: @dttaylor9 @korb_denis @alavergaspues @randy_renner @truelifesimon @fleming_pamc @stallfortime @kevinomccarthy Since your “Trump Gun” photo didn’t belong to the shooter would you care to comment on the OH guy , who was an Antifa plus Elizabeth Warren supporter?!
C: (1.000%) T: Using the progressive lefts’ logic Elizabeth Warren is clearly responsible for the Dayton OH mass shooting over the weekend. This is how ridiculous their reasoning is and yet they will continue to push it. Are people really stupid (gullible) enough... https://t.co/dNC8RATdM6
C: (0.732%) T: @MatthewtheRule @JerseyFinFan Your TL has Elizabeth Warren retweets in it, so it’s a safe assumption.
C: (1.000%) T: It’s crazy how the Dayton shooter was a radical leftist who supported Elizabeth warren 😂😂😂 whole truth not half you sheep
C: (1.000%) T: @AP And the other shooter was inspired by antifa and Elizabeth Warren. Youforgot to add that.
C: (0.988%) T: @KomradeKickflip @erik316wttn @CNN If he hates women, why would he support Elizabeth Warren? Hmmmmm.....

C: (1.000%) T: @CNNPolitics Might you suggest Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders go to El Paso and Dayton? Hell while you’re at it, why don’t you request Antifa to make a visit
C: (1.000%) T: @gracewontshutup @JohnCornyn @WSJ To Seamstress/GraceWontShutUp, why are you calling U.S. Senator John Cornyn a hypocrite when he's apparently defending Elizabeth Warren, his fellow Senator?
C: (0.999%) T: @ABC Is she going to tell Elizabeth Warren the same thing! After all, the Dayton shootings were carried out by a supporter of Pocahontas, Antifa, and crazy liberals!  Doesn’t matter....#TrumpLandslide2020 ...it’s already over! 🎉❤️🔥🧨🇺🇸🇺🇸
C: (1.000%) T: Attempting to tie the Dayton shooter to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren is a new low even for Trump.  He's already underwater in key Midwest states, even in Texas.  I doubt this strategy will help.  https://t.co/ptudCuwK42
C: (0.533%) T: @CNN Hey CNN, you have yet to do a segment about how this shooter was a far left supporting Elizabeth Warren socialist extremist. I mean if you're going to politicize the El Paso shooter with White nationalists, Let's not pick and choose.

C: (0.698%) T: elizabeth warren was been saying what black voters have been wanting to hear from a politician for forever &amp; no one is listening to her. am i missing something?  :(

C: (1.000%) T: @TheDemocrats Now tell everyone the Dayton Ohio shooter was a leftist with Antifa ties, loved Elizabeth Warren and demanded socialism now. So you're trying to pass a law in the Shooters Name? Exactly what the shooter wanted?
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke So by your logic Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Dayton murders. Right, you’ll be a great president. Your EQ is way too low bro
C: (1.000%) T: @mynbc15 Antifa is more dangerous than white supremacist. Look at the Ohio shooting.  He was a left wing nut job. Who supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren

C: (0.990%) T: Trump is not taking responsibility (again) for his words.  Pointing fingers at Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  Not respectful to those who lost their lives. #DaytonTrumpPhotoOp #DaytonShooting #EndGunViolence #BanAssaultWeapons
