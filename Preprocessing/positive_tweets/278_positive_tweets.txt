C: (0.996%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress Why arenâ€™t ppl talking about the Ohio shooter? Is it bc he doesnâ€™t fit your narrative? It could be bc he was an Elizabeth Warren backer.
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke El PasoMan was registered Democrat who changed his status only minutes before shooting  Ohio shooter Elizabeth Warren groupie. Democrats just can't stop murdering since Trump shut down the child sex trafficking across the border
C: (1.000%) T: @washingtonpost Gtfo WaPo. It's public information!  List all the people Trump has obsessively targeted!  Secretary Hillary Clinton, President Obama, Rep. Maxine Waters, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Elijah Cummings, Sen. John McCain, Kahn Family, April Ryan, Jim Acosta, George Soros, Jeff Bezos..
C: (1.000%) T: Iâ€™ve donated to Elizabeth Warren so many times that I got an email saying I am now being added to her donor wall in her main office in Boston. This honor feels like Animal Crossing when a neighbor would give you their portrait
C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro debate me on Skype! Iâ€™ve debated some people before. But I support Elizabeth Warren for President. Iâ€™m pretty far into the bottom left of the political compass test. We can debate in person if youâ€™ll pay for my air faire!

C: (1.000%) T: @AP What about the other shooting? The one who was apart of antics? Supported Elizabeth Warren?  Wait... that doesn't fit the narrative, I remember that now.
C: (1.000%) T: What about the shooter in Ohio? He was a big fan of Elizabeth Warren. Are you telling her to cool her rhetoric? By the way, the next time you tweet a picture of yourself, put on a shirt! https://t.co/i5lv8yJhdU

C: (0.991%) T: @PeteButtigieg @NRA FACT CHECK: FALSE.   Hey Gay Mayor Pete â€” The Dayton gunman was a radical Leftist (just like you). He wanted socialism and planned to vote for Elizabeth Warren.   Would you like to revise your bullshit tweet?   #Trump2020
