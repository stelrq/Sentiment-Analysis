C: (1.000%) T: How can anyone not support Elizabeth Warren? She is literally just trying to make your life better. https://t.co/Eg9dmAAiug
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: We should make it so every home in America has internet.  "But I don't trust the government with the internet!"  A. Other services would still exist, it wouldn't be replacing them.  B. I don't particularly trust the current ISPs, either. https://t.co/folyKQN4HF
C: (1.000%) T: @MiaFarrow He was a little busy comforting shooting victims of that vile liberal follower of Elizabeth Warren.  Toni would have appreciated that.
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol @DevinCow Yes we do deserve Elizabeth Warren. This country has such potential and I think she can help us actualize it.
C: (1.000%) T: You really should have Elizabeth warren give this speech ðŸ˜­ https://t.co/6XxjQc8n7z
C: (0.986%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren pushes hate breeding a recent shooter
C: (1.000%) T: @RoArquette You can play the Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris ploy, Rosanna, claiming intersectionality to which you have no right. I don't recommend it. It's dishonest. Just become the best rich, white person you can be. You earned the riches and you had no control over the white part.
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnTur79477764 ...hypothetical.  Trump re-elected but Dodgers win 4 straight World Series.  Or loses to any Dem (letâ€™s say Elizabeth warren ) and the giants make the playoffs at least once in the next 4 years.
C: (0.995%) T: Yay for Elizabeth Warren! She had my vote!! https://t.co/kosOsr6Wft
C: (0.993%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Please provide proof where Elizabeth Warren motivated him to shoot people....
C: (0.964%) T: @BillKristol They deserve Elizabeth Warren in a particularly bad mood.
C: (1.000%) T: @Antonio08051975 @Goss30Goss @DonaldJTrumpJr So by your logic the shooting in Dayton Ohio is Elizabeth Warren and Bernieâ€™s fault, the shooting at the Republican baseball field is Bernieâ€™s fault, the shooting at the gay night club, and the military base is Islamâ€™s fault etc etc..
C: (1.000%) T: @DienamiteReady I identify as white, yet have more Indian in me than Elizabeth Warren. Wales, Scotland, France, Germany, Shawnee, Cherokee. I'm glad to have been born American.
C: (0.995%) T: Ps vote for Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/SbL3S9EKdQ
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol Elizabeth Warren would be a better president than any living Republican.
C: (0.995%) T: @ericswalwell Really-Elizabeth Warren has a white supremacy supporter? Because one of the shooters is a @ewarren and ANTIFA supporter! Guess so. @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @NicolleDWallace @CoryBooker @BetoORourke @BernieSanders @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @JoaquinCastrotx
C: (1.000%) T: The rich deserve Elizabeth Warren taxing them. The criminally corrupt deserve Elizabeth Warren jailing them. The average American deserve Elizabeth Warren fighting for them. I deserve Elizabeth Warren as a competitive debater because THIS IS WHAT I CALL REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT.
C: (1.000%) T: .@ewarrenâ€™s commitment to equality in education, as well as listening to and elevating marginalized voices is not new or contrived for the campaign, itâ€™s fundamentally who she is https://t.co/LlecRkU0uh https://t.co/9TwBDixGUg
C: (1.000%) T: There is so much in this @rtraister profile of @ewarren as a teacher and a presidential candidate that make me love her and respect her and want her to be President even more than I already do: https://t.co/LlecRkU0uh
C: (1.000%) T: @laurastacotruck @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump And the guy who wrote the manifesto said he had those ideas before Trump even came onto the political scene. And he said that Trump would get incorrectly blamed. And the Dayton shooter was a Progressive Socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren and Socialist Bernie Sanders.
C: (1.000%) T: @ericswalwell You forgot Dayton OH. Where the gunman was a 24-year-old Democrat-supporting, gun-loving Satanist. Who  expressed support for Sen. Elizabeth Warren.   Check out the article in Newsweek.
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC This man is nothing more than a hate filled fear monger. Notice he made NO reference to the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders supporter mass Ohio shooter! Shame on him and shame on MSNBC for giving him air time! #GodBlessAmerica ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren's whole appeal is "look at me! I'm so smart! I know what to do! I have a plan! I'm a Native American woman! Leave it up to me, fam! Me, me, me!"
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner I scrolled down your twitter page and I couldnt find anything about the Far Left leaning White Male Mass Shooter who backed Elizabeth Warren in Dayton OH.
C: (0.987%) T: @KTVU Trump didnâ€™t try to do anything.   The Dayton shooter was a self proclaimed Liberal/socialist. He was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren.   All Trump did was talk about facts that the media have failed to report.
