C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Absolutely!!  You know why?  They were both democrats and one openly admitted he supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, socialist and hated trump. One supported antifa. How about that?
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren has a net worth of $14.5 million dollars and owns a home worth $5 million https://t.co/iiDEMIkqMr
C: (0.698%) T: Actually this shooter went nuts after he saw the Democratic debates, and when everyone's hand went up about giving illegals free healthcare, why aren't any Democrats being blamed! The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan, why wasn't she at the hospital in Dayton ? https://t.co/LbfzvtfPfA
C: (1.000%) T: @shaunking @BernieSanders It’s one thing to care about those people on the train...what will he do for them? Elizabeth Warren has a plan.
C: (1.000%) T: Theory: being from another New England state (or NH-bordering state) gives you an advantage in NH.  If true, Elizabeth Warren may split that vote with Sanders this time around... it won't be as easy for Sanders. https://t.co/mm7G8zdC8M
C: (1.000%) T: @jimmyfailla This little foray into manliness is slightly better than Elizabeth Warren's foray in manly beer drinking .

C: (0.990%) T: @wwwbighag @Alyssa_Milano Alyssa Milano MAY HAVE visited Epstein in jail 5 minutes before he committed suicide. . It's not a problem if you put "may have" in front of a statement &amp; it gives you an easy out . Alyssa Milano MAY HAVE called Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas . Alyssa Milano MAY HAVE voted for Trump

C: (0.990%) T: @SNLinReview Please let Kate be there this fall, we need her Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @FrankConniff ....or Warren is not progressive enough. Maybe we should be more honest about her policies before pulling the misogyny card.  https://t.co/aFUL9oV9jI

C: (1.000%) T: @Airmit106 @chrislongview Perhaps you need to educate yourself on how Native Americans view Native identity. They don't view it the way whites do, and you're viewing it through a white lens.  Start here:  https://t.co/KYCpgU7mbz
C: (1.000%) T: @allinwithchris That woman with the sign is a member of the AZ Patriots, designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. They come to disrupt anything they can. They hassled us at the Women's March, they distrupted Bernie Sandesr, they disrupted Elizabeth Warren. They are scumbags.
C: (1.000%) T: I feel like Elizabeth Warren’s consistent wardrobe of black top + black pants + colorful blazer/sweater is the uniform I’m going to adopt in my advancing years…by which I mean, like, maybe a year from now.
C: (1.000%) T: @Cosby @OccupyTheDems @JohnWil66453546 @CathyYoung63 @RitaPanahi How about I do not get behind it because I don't want to raise taxes on the middle class anymore. Bernie Sanders said it would, Elizabeth Warren said it and Kamala Harris did (but at least she said she wouldn't get behind it because of it so that's a plus for her I guess)
C: (0.532%) T: @Castle_in_CA @OsigahK The Dayton killer was a Elizabeth Warren supporter. You can't control who supports you. The left calls Tucker a white supremacist because he supports border security. Can you give an example that proves he's a white supremacist? Something he said or did?
C: (1.000%) T: @trump_troll_16 @KDKA How about the Elizabeth Warren loving SJW that shot up Akron. Two can play this game.
C: (1.000%) T: @GeneBryant2 Elizabeth Warren isn’t attacking other Democrats and talking about policy. She’s talking to Midwestern farmers today. She’s at the top of my list. She actually listens to people. She can punch back at Trump because she can think on her feet without a script. She is electable.
