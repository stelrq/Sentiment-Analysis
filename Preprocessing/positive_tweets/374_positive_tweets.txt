C: (1.000%) T: @KECumberland @SierraWhiskee @StephenKing I guess that's what President Trump does when he throws out his nicknames. What better nickname could you give to Elizabeth Warren besides Pocahontas... claiming to be Indian so she can get all the advantages and perks! And then there's crooked Hillary appeared that name fits...
C: (0.503%) T: This is exactly why you will never be POTUS.  You are slandering the officers without all the facts.  Shame on you Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/izvO0Obtqu

C: (0.999%) T: Probably not going to the Fair this year but a friend is. He‚Äôs already seen Jay Inslee and hopes to collect them all. Have another friend headed there to see Elizabeth Warren on the Soapbox.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren My big important issue is making sure Elizabeth Warren is NEVER president.  How can Liz help with this?
C: (1.000%) T: @saragoldrickrab Used to...no longer. Some think out loud well, and can raise a hand before knowing what they'll say; some prefer to formulate more fully, which slows them.  Relevant article--long and insightful--about teaching (and Elizabeth Warren): https://t.co/WokiMIObyZ. H/T @nancyflanagan
C: (1.000%) T: @WalkMom1 @beccanalia @Gwydion620 @AJentleson @AllenFrancesMD @PeteButtigieg I agree he looks tired.  I like Pete, but he should run for Senator or governor first.  My own favorite is Kamala. I love Elizabeth Warren, but I worry men won‚Äôt vote for her.  Joe has never won by himself, tho he is beloved in DE.  He‚Äôs really great in person, but not speeches.
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson ‚ÄòElizabeth Warren‚Äôs supporters are so good and quiet and just do what they‚Äôre supposed to.‚Äô Come on bro.
C: (1.000%) T: Great article about ‚Å¶@SenWarren and the art of teaching!  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the heart of really great teaching,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that I believe in you. I don‚Äôt get up and teach to show how smart I am. I get up and teach to show how smart you are‚Äù https://t.co/dcgWsc6R7d
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister But it may work in Wisconsin. Voters there hear the word "socialist" and they break into hives, even tho' Bernie, Elizabeth Warren et al are about as socialist as Angela Merkel. Time &amp; time again, Wisconsin, rural Penns. and Michigan vote "safe." Biden-Warren, that's my feeling.
C: (1.000%) T: ICYMI ==&gt; Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/34q1G39hUo
C: (0.999%) T: @BrentWelder @Gacheeta94 "Second" as in "doing half as well as Joe Biden and about .1 points better than Elizabeth Warren."
C: (1.000%) T: @Styx666Official In reality today, the actual "privileged" are the ones who can associate with one of the multiple "oppressed" groups.  This is why you have white as snow Elizabeth Warren fake her way into the Native Indian "oppressed" group hoping for the undeniable privileges it provided.

C: (1.000%) T: Agree. I remember when, in the Senate Elizabeth Warren was reading a letter into the Congressional record,  from Coretta Scott King regarding racism. Warren was told to stop reading &amp; sit down by #MoscowMitch.  Sit down &amp; shut up! https://t.co/4DrraK8gXF
