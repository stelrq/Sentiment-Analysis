C: (1.000%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI You obviously need the help of a good psychiatrist. The shooter who almost killed @SteveScalise was a Bernie supporter and the Dayton shooter supported Bernie and Elizabeth Warren. BTW, here's a poster of the 2019 mass shooters, it doesn't seem to be a white supremacy problem. https://t.co/7PfC69iXM1

C: (0.990%) T: @BillKristol @brianbeutler We'd be LUCKY to have Elizabeth Warren. And Republicans believe in Socialism as long as the beneficiaries are large corporations or farmers. LOOK AT THE LEGISLATION THEY PASS.
C: (1.000%) T: Just a wild guess here but I'm thinking these old dems still think ppl r stupid. Most ppl r realizing the truth about how dem politicians treat their ppl. They've gotten 2 b millionaires by "working 4 the ppl!" Ah yeah sure!! #WakeUpAmerica  #WWG1WGA  https://t.co/OZQXl1PmXL
C: (0.994%) T: @SenWarren  Elizabeth Warren is a DESPICABLE EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN AND SHOULD NEVER BE PERMITTED TO BE PRESIDENT! SHES A MENTALLY DISTURBED HATE PANDERING FRAUD!  She holds zero RESPECT for the Highest office when she had the gaul to call a President a white supremacist! EVIL woman!
C: (0.574%) T: The New York Times reported that Warren, asked in a brief interview if she believes Trump is a white supremacist, replied "yes" without hesitation. https://t.co/AnbqMvYV7H

C: (0.999%) T: Whether it’s newspapers amplifying the disgusting rhetoric of people like Beto O’Rourke and Elizabeth Warren or the constant stream of divisive, racially tinged editorials that are being pushed out, there’s no question of their role.  2/
C: (0.723%) T: 'Creepy' Elizabeth Warren, 'Crazy' Nancy Pelosi, and 'Lying' Adam Schiff never win against Trump.  My family will win. Make America Great Again!
C: (0.997%) T: @TGHawthorne @BrendanSchaub Except the dude in Dayton that was an Elizabeth Warren supporter? Fuck facts though right??
C: (0.994%) T: Who would you want to Foxhall with you? Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, or Donald Trump?
C: (1.000%) T: To mitigate white privilege, the Washington Senators name should be changed to the Redskins; honoring the firewater drinking, gonorrhea-laden, always warring against each other natives that once pooped behind trees, sea to shining sea.   Elizabeth Warren can be honorary coach. https://t.co/3SaYJe9AmG
C: (1.000%) T: "Super-regulators like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren already want the Post Office to provide retail bank accounts" The sassiness is strong with @norbertjmichel @Heritage @StephenMoore  https://t.co/H8yaM3Jrnq

C: (1.000%) T: @KillerQueer3 @RealResistance6 @KevinAHarperVO @StacyLStiles @RealSaavedra @benshapiro @MrAndyNgo I'm fully aware of what my Ancestors were all about, I happen to be a descendant of Daniel Boone, and unlike Elizabeth Warren, I really do have some American Indian in me...I am also a student of history.  So please, try your indoctrination somewhere else, you have the wrong...
C: (0.987%) T: @juliemason Pitch this to Elizabeth Warren: offer to interview her in your Warren voice.
C: (1.000%) T: First Democrats try and blame the El Paso shooting on Trump because the shooter was a white supremest (no correlation). Then Republicans want to blame the Dayton shooting on Elizabeth Warren and Bernie because the shooter supported them.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist - news - https://t.co/xUGaKI8fnA https://t.co/6CyCWkqjRV
C: (1.000%) T: Well, if there’s one thing Elizabeth Warren and I can agree on...we’re both excited BALLERS is coming back on 8/25!
C: (0.988%) T: @BreitbartNews Why don’t that Disgusting Hideous  Bitch also Include the Lunatic Mass Murderer in Dayton who must’ve been following orders of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders too !
C: (1.000%) T: @scontorno Elizabeth Warren send out a fund raising email the day after the El Paso shooting trying to capitalize on it. Beto O'Rourke hasn't shut up in 4 days.  What's your point?
C: (1.000%) T: Just got home from the DSA convention. Everybody kept asking if they could fuck Elizabeth Warren in the specific event that Sanders is VP nom. Comrade, they won't even let me fuck Sanders
