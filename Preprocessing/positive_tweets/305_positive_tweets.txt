C: (1.000%) T: @DomShow1210 Nickname : Elizabeth Warren-Fauxcohontos because I believe that I was one of the first to use it on the internet and Rush Limbaugh uses it.
C: (0.780%) T: Donald tried to call the Dayton shooter an antifa, Sanders/Warren fan.  Donald had to call her "Elizabeth Warren" instead of using the racial slur nickname 'Pocahontas'  Tonight on Tucker... "Antifa shooter tried to kill Christan Trump supporters who are TOTALLY not racists"
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis Oh really? I suppose when Obama, mad Maxine Waters, Al Sharpton, Cory Booker, all call to get in white people's faces, that's ok. You're as mentally ill as these mass shooters. Trump did nothing to incite these crazy people, esp since they back Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Dear #GOPfascist, the day Bernie or Elizabeth Warren calls immigrants ‚Äúrapists‚Äù or ‚Äúinvaders‚Äù &amp; laughs when a supporter yells ‚Äúshoot ‚Äòem,‚Äù you might have a point.  Until then, SHUT THE F*CK UP DONNIE!  #GOPisaTerroristOrganization #NRABloodMoney

C: (1.000%) T: @GeorgeConk But this article raises some questions about whether she has  resisted inquiries into the data and analysis underlying her scholarship that need to be further explored, since they are highly relevant to how she might make decisions as president. 2/2 https://t.co/PpZApwannL

C: (0.962%) T: @USATODAY There is zero evidence that the shooter in Ohio was any in any way a leftist. There's zero evidence he supported Bernie or Elizabeth Warren what this was was Donald Trump taking another opportunity to push the blame for his rhetoric and its actions on someone else.
C: (0.584%) T: The president just said that he's trying to keep out of the political fray and IMMEDIATELY followed that with that the shooter in Ohio was a Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporter! What a joke!
C: (0.989%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Except the shooter in Ohio considered himself a leftist who  liked Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC @senatemajldr If you see the Ohio shooting the guy was a complete leftist socialist.

C: (1.000%) T: @bobbyleelive I know youre a drug addled comedian but at your worst you cannot equate Pol Pot to Trump. Are you just trying to signal to people that you know who Pol Pot was? Read his doctrine. Youll find he has more in common with Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren. But yeah youre kinda smart.
C: (1.000%) T: So what about Beto? Up for hours watching him in El Paso. Telling it like it is. Visceral. Good to see someone besides Trump roused &amp; rousing, but with compassion &amp; care: Imagine: Elizabeth Warren with Beto as running mate: But would he ever be VP? And could Warren win?
C: (1.000%) T: @thenorwegian76 @MattAlles2 @ch_fungus @EileenForBlue @Carrasquillo @laureldavilacpa @GOP The Dayton shooter made it perfectly clear that he was an Elizabeth Warren follower. The man who shot representative Scalise was a Bernie supporter and said he did it for Bernie. You liberals are such pathetic hypocrites! ü§¨
