C: (0.994%) T: @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight The Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders fan!  The socialist.
C: (1.000%) T: Andy said it so nice I'm saying it twice I won't vote for Bernie Sanders. I won't vote for Joe Biden. I won't vote for Kamala Harris. I will vote for Elizabeth Warren.  In the Democratic Primary.   That being said, who ever wins the nomination, I WILL vote Blue. https://t.co/5JOaXfcj7g
C: (0.999%) T: @NateSilver538 Imagine being so stupid that you think Elizabeth Warren wouldn‚Äôt get absolutely destroyed in the general.
C: (0.997%) T: @NJMcConne11 @TrinityResists @JohnCornyn "At this point the El Paso shooter seems to be channeling Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders."  All you idiots are on a echo chamber.
C: (1.000%) T: New from me: Colleges employ Andrew Yangs, Tim Ryans, and Elizabeth Warrens to work in fields from education to Spanish to art.   These professors are definitely not running for president‚Äîunlike, of course, @andrewyang, @timryan and @ewarren.   https://t.co/VTMVWRnvz0 @chronicle
C: (1.000%) T: PA: Former VP Joe Biden has a solid lead but MA Senator Elizabeth Warren is gaining followed by VT Senator Bernie Sanders; most voters are generally satisfied with the direction of the state by Franklin &amp; Marshall¬†College https://t.co/1CO7aQW1lA https://t.co/URG4tYw73w
C: (1.000%) T: Joe Biden and Cory Booker both gained three points in the four early voting states last week, while Elizabeth Warren dropped five points and Kamala Harris two.   https://t.co/kj1CfKOvol via @politicususa
C: (1.000%) T: Michael Roberts critiques the ideas of Mariana Mazzucato who "is an adviser to the Labour Party on economic policy; 'has the ear' of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, advises Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren and also SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon." https://t.co/jMGCdDLbMk
C: (0.999%) T: There's a new progressive farm movement afloat (!!) and coming out in force against the rapid pace of corporate consolidation is a common pillar #antitrust   1st out the gate was @ewarren. Read more --&gt; https://t.co/uEQqjy5HSL https://t.co/2DxXjEBcwD

C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren @ewarren Strawberries are in season and my grandson‚Äôs in town‚Äîthat means strawberry shortcake! https://t.co/Kkgn4W5qC2
C: (1.000%) T: @andylassner Can we have a debate with him and Elizabeth Warren please üôè one on  one @realDonaldTrump Donald let‚Äôs do this see how good you are @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @ChatByCC @MatthewJshow
C: (0.989%) T: All 2020 Senate Dem Candidates Absent for Vote to Send Humanitarian Relief to Border.  Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bennet, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, &amp; Bernie Sanders, all out of town campaigning...for humane treatment of illegals at the border.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren made &gt; $300,000 a year for ‚Äòteaching‚Äô one class.  No wonder college education is so expensive!
C: (0.921%) T: @eli_yarian Bernie Sanders first and then Elizabeth Warren. Bernie represents a significant change. The others are scared of negative consequences of damaging businesses to the point that we are inevitably moving to oligarchy. Anyone but Trump, but Biden is the worst outcome.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren What would you rather do with a $1 than give it to Elizabeth Warren?   I'll start.   I'd rather spend it on gas station sushi.
C: (1.000%) T: I'm listening to a podcast about @ewarren and apparently her students were quoted as saying: "Wonder Woman wishes she could be Elizabeth Warren" and I had to pause it and hold back tears lol I am enamored by this woman
C: (0.988%) T: How Robert O‚ÄôRourke Became ‚ÄòBeto‚Äô? The same way Elizabeth Warren became Indian. The same way Kamala Harris got famous.....https://t.co/6ggVSAAleN
C: (1.000%) T: This is an incredibly extensive  gun reform analysis of exactly what our country needs. Please read every word of Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs plan to protect us all, or have someone in your household read it to the family.  It makes such good sense!
C: (0.996%) T: @HillaryClinton I just picked up the tab Hillary. Tell me what that means when I've never met you in person but only on social media just like Elizabeth Warren said about Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: Mayor Pete Buttigieg is so intelligent &amp; even though he has a lot to learn about how the WHITE HOUSE runs, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a quick learner. He reminds me of Barack Obama in some ways. I would love to see Joe Biden with either Mayor Pete or Elizabeth Warren on the winning ticket.
C: (1.000%) T: @TheSlyWolfy Probably until a more dangerous female leader appears. If Elizabeth Warren manages to pull out ahead of Joe Biden like I hope she will, she'll be the new target of choice.
C: (0.994%) T: Am I sexist? Whenever Elizabeth Warren speaks, I feel as though I am watching Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
C: (1.000%) T: Government Technology reports U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has sent a letter to Capital One seeking more information about its recent data breach that affected more than 100 million Americans. Warren not only wants to know how the breach... https://t.co/GKAcU9zuYL
C: (1.000%) T: @EWErickson Check out Elizabeth warren‚Äôs statement on it if you want to see how it should be handled presidentially.
