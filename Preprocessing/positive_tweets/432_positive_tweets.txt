C: (1.000%) T: Antifa aren't liberals.  Not welcomed Dems. They are by definition Anti-fascists. They think that Elizabeth Warren and Trump are the same. Alt-right, on the other hand, is a welcomed member of the @GOP (although not conservative in the political sense.) https://t.co/pb7VXEhXay
C: (1.000%) T: @SusanWojda @ThisWeekABC You do know that the shooter in Ohio was a left wing liberal supporter of Elizabeth Warren, right? I guess by your ‚Äúlogic‚Äù she is responsible for that shooting! The only one responsible in any of these shootings is the nut job that pulled the trigger!
C: (1.000%) T: @DSSerik @BetoBranigan @USMCRogue @yellojkt @JayCaruso I‚Äôm a little out of the loop on the Dayton shooter. I know he identified as a ‚ÄúPro Satan leftist who voted for Elizabeth Warren‚Äù. But that mag? Where do you even get something like that? Mind, I‚Äôm not buying one, 30 rounds and check the target is enough for me.
C: (1.000%) T: @piersmorgan The Dayton killer was a lib whom supported Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA. Now transpires the Killer's manifesto in El Paso wasn't even written by him. Here's some black supremacist terrorists from the last five years.. @iamcardib is a black supremacist, she said she  hates whites. https://t.co/0kKSaZXv8S

C: (1.000%) T: @bkchiblist @alon_levy @ColinVParker @mattyglesias The moral authority of the Presidency is broken, IMO.  I don‚Äôt see the moral authority of the Presidency as a luxury the way Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders seem to or think policy constitutes character.  I suspect plenty of others agree with me.
C: (1.000%) T: If you don't talk about families, then it's easy to disembody subprime mortgages and asset securitization and unemployment rates without remembering that every one of those numbers is a million families.  - Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @lancearmstrong üôÑ You cheated to get ahead. You‚Äôre fake. You stole someone else‚Äôs win and forever changed their lives. Yet, 3.3 million people follow you. They don‚Äôt care. They must be Elizabeth Warren voters.
C: (1.000%) T: @MissedMyProzac @WajahatAli Because it‚Äôs two women. I like Elizabeth Warren a lot, she speaks her mind and true feelings and also has a plan. Harris just says whatever she thinks the base wants to hear.
C: (1.000%) T: Don't agree w/everything in the article about the male candidates, but why not this? Or 2 other female candidates?  "It‚Äôs entirely possible that¬†1¬†of these women will win the race for Democratic presidential candidate, &amp; when she does, it‚Äôs already assumed https://t.co/Ua4SvvIHhH
C: (0.987%) T: @Lesperado1 @sialnez @riotwomennn @cmclymer @KamalaHarris @ewarren And here‚Äôs Warren doing the same thing:  https://t.co/tIslS4egI7
C: (1.000%) T: @RepBarbaraLee Oops btw. Why didn't you bring up the Dayton shooter and his association with liberal ideals, strong Democrat ties, and his strong support of Elizabeth Warren?  Are you that filled with deception that makes you always want to lie?
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson You know who doesnt constantly get smeared by supposed "journalists" 24/7? Elizabeth Warren. You know who should be more concerned with doing their jobs, for a change, than policing reactions of voters on Twitter? "Journalists".
C: (0.987%) T: Boston (MA) Globe:  Elizabeth Warren circles in Iowa as Joe Biden stumbles . More #Biden #news - https://t.co/zwOREArfCO
C: (1.000%) T: Democrats in Iowa, ? Warren excited presidential ?  Pete thoughtful and consistent, yes Presidential. That's phonetic  BOO'-tuh-juhj.  https://t.co/WMjhrZvG8c
C: (1.000%) T: @mehdirhasan I agree.Biden should never gotten in the https://t.co/CabpmTo2yR only hoping that Democrats will see that he's not up for the job.We need someone strong... Elizabeth Warren is my choice.She could destroy Trump in a debate.
C: (0.972%) T: Elizabeth Warren needs to step down out of the Presidential race before she invokes another hate crime like that in Dayton Ohio.  She needs to stop influencing progressive "politically correct"  nutjobs to murder more  people!!!!  Yep!
C: (0.566%) T: Probably unfair to Elizabeth Warren honestly.
C: (1.000%) T: Remember how I tweeted a couple days ago about how an American conservative is just some dude who has read no one but Burke, mill, and Locke? https://t.co/8hpEcno86F
C: (1.000%) T: @janelleybelley2 @6549lmartin I said no but I really know 3. Joe biden, elizabeth warren and bernie sanders.
C: (0.999%) T: elizabeth warren is racist but ok go off i guess
C: (1.000%) T: @Keydet1977 @SharylAttkisson I think that is kind of like the southern phrase "Bless your heart" (translation: you are dumb), so as to not be too hard on the intellectually challenged Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @Mer__tweets @WajahatAli The person who will inspire the most turnout is definitely not the person whose share of vote declined in her state in 2018, who has low in state approvals and who failed to inspire minority turnout (aka Elizabeth Warren in MA)
C: (0.995%) T: Interesting convo.   I‚Äôve BEEN convinced that @ewarren is one of very few Dems, who TRULY advocates for regular Americans.   Elizabeth Warren Has Democrats Shaking https://t.co/FGcFy9d9Zl via @YouTube
