C: (1.000%) T: @HillaryClinton And a week ago in Ohio an Elizabeth Warren supporter and proud socialist committed similar atrocities. Why are you not saying anything about that??

C: (1.000%) T: OMG. Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris don‚Äôt benefit?  Really? https://t.co/cxZPTEutJW
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren This is obscene &amp; unfair. There is no way the Walton's deserve that wealth. Their wealth is dependent on exploiting their hardworking associate/slaves. Elizabeth Warren's plan is right on target, but the tax should be even higher, relative to the reprehensible wage mistreatment.
C: (1.000%) T: @DemGovs Elizabeth Warren is my pick.  I don't do these polls because I can't contribute every time.
C: (1.000%) T: @45MustGoToday @mbfaust57 @RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank Tom left the ‚Äúteam‚Äù, or don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs possible for anyone to change? Personally I‚Äôm hoping Tom has to vote for Elizabeth Warren which I know will hurt a bit, but at least he has some principles. üòä

C: (0.999%) T: After an entire evening of savagely trolling Elizabeth Warren on Twitter, William was disappointed to see that she still hadn't blocked him ... Said Bill, "I called her Lieawatha, Fauxcahontas and Fake Indian numerous times and I'm still not blocked ... It's very upsetting." https://t.co/fmcXANB07n
C: (1.000%) T: @NeeraRubio Elizabeth Warren is a kinder, gentler sort of imperialist. That is why she has my vote!
C: (1.000%) T: Check out this fascinating article by @rtraister over at the @TheCut about @DNC presidential candidate and fellow @RutgersLaw alum @ewarren, and the clear influence her career in education has had on her policy initiatives and candidacy for president.  https://t.co/gDUVuK0Fsa
C: (0.543%) T: @Lala_Innis OH? Then WHY did Elizabeth Warren pretend to be Native American and Rachel Dolezal PRETEND to be Black? yeah, White Privileged is B.S. just like everything that comes out of the Left
C: (1.000%) T: @RepAdamSchiff @billsvision I don't remember you being so vocal about lies when Elizabeth Warren tweeted the other day that Michael Brown was murdered by a cop. Seems your ethics are selective ‚Äì which means you have none.
C: (1.000%) T: I'm beginning to think Elizabeth Warren has to be the Democratic nominee. Klobuchar, Booker, Harris, Buttigieg, Castro or Booker would be fine by me but Senator Warren seems best.  It just can't be Biden nor Bernie.
C: (1.000%) T: @mowoodier @mowoodier My favorite is ‚ÄòFauxcahontis‚Äô Elizabeth Warren ‚Äúcooking‚Äù in the kitchen... ‚ÄúBut first, I‚Äôm GONNNA GET ME A BEER‚Äù. ü§£ So authentic!

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Someone asked me if I would ever vote for Elizabeth Warren? I said hell no, she used her fake Indian heritage to get ahead of minorities because she wasn't good enough to do it by merit or her white privilege.
C: (1.000%) T: It'd past heckin' time:  Jenny is one of my favorite people in Warren Stan twitter, and if any of you are not following her, you need to now: @jennychen8601. She's passionate, eloquent, and an all around badass of a human being who loves Elizabeth Warren.   Go. Follow. Jenny. https://t.co/HCbs6MTZ6p
