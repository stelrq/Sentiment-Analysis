C: (0.987%) T: @AuthorFAChekki “Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren” https://t.co/V0lyJn0qhX
C: (1.000%) T: Democratic candidates use it so often, it should be counted. A counter, like a clock, shows a count for every time they use the word racist. I would love to see stats like baseball.  Elizabeth Warren is batting a racist to words used of 5.95.  Joe Bidden has been killing, dropped https://t.co/6hKtFXE1tF
C: (0.654%) T: @JoeBiden you're a moron. I guess Maxine Waters is responsible for any and all attacks on police. I guess Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton?
C: (1.000%) T: @RobinsNest333 I do believe Joe is our best choice.  Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris would be amazing VP's

C: (0.987%) T: #RealNews @cnnbrk @DavidMuir @JoeNBC @NBCNightlyNews @BretBaier Dayton shooter was a Satanic socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @riftvalley @CNNPolitics Right. He was motivated by Elizabeth Warren so he joined antifa. This is well established.
C: (1.000%) T: @EdIsBackKAG2020 Fake Indian Elizabeth Warren is repulsive to most people. Elderly alcoholic who tries to look cool and energetic and happy and FAILS.
C: (1.000%) T: Riddle me this @Twitter   Why do people like Elizabeth Warren. Ihlan Omar, Bernie Sanders &amp; AOC show up on my feed?. AND I have blocked Omar more than once   #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
C: (1.000%) T: @shaunking @realDonaldTrump And Elizabeth Warren caused Dayton.  Doesn’t work one way Talcum X,  he was a leftist so you should call it like It is,  but we know you won’t.
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib You know that cat in Ohio was an Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders supporter, right? Right?
C: (0.627%) T: @deemun48 @thehill Why did she allow this shooting to take place? She and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie could have prevented it by not stoking hatred.
C: (0.980%) T: @VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren is directly responsible for Dayton by stoking the flames of Socialism. The Dayton shooter was a supporter of EW and socialist. EW racism is feeding these violent socialist to include ANTIFA. Capitalism is what makes us great not diversity.
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC Why are we not talking about the Dayton shooter who supported you and Elizabeth Warren and referred to concentration camps in his Twitter feed hmm sounds similar to something you said!
C: (0.989%) T: @Burkmc I remember that Elizabeth Warren was "troubled" by former/retired  President Obama's $400k book deal, but went on to sign a $300k book deal of her own as a US Senator and presidential candidate.
C: (1.000%) T: @rulajebreal White nationalist or white Supremacist thats BS the left is the real problem. One of shooters was a  supporter of Elizabeth Warren and then you have Antifa and politicians attacking people and the right is the one with issues.
C: (0.984%) T: Elizabeth Warren is rising in the polls. #TeamWarren @ewarren  https://t.co/17n8WcFjPh
C: (1.000%) T: Unless this is handled very carefully, it could position Sanders as a candidate of the past, owed a vote of thanks, but not an actual vote next winter. https://t.co/oRLgAk3i7p
C: (0.937%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris’s Michael Brown tweets really did get the facts wrong. https://t.co/1NergCQQyQ
C: (1.000%) T: @novfam @tribelaw So I’ll search your other tweets about blaming Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and all the mass shootings under Obama’s watch! So predictable &amp; if you own a gun, it should be ripped out of your hands bc you’re mental state is questionable!
C: (1.000%) T: G. Will: Trump 'conservatives' are same as Elizabeth Warren socialists, but not as principled or honest https://t.co/Q3l3red1oR
