C: (1.000%) T: @kurteichenwald @peterdaou Yes very true. I'm constantly attacked by Bernie bros because I'm a pragmatist for saying that while i dont support Bernie in the primary I would vote for him in the general IF he is the nominee, they actually tell me Elizabeth Warren is a republican... insane!

C: (0.988%) T: @Dax_x98 thoughts ? Just one.... President Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/wFc0Ic8weI Gotta give the media credit. It never stops working to invent new narratives and cover up the truth.  Regardless of the facts, the new media narrative will now be that an Elizabeth Warren supporter, who mostly shot men, was a sexist.
C: (1.000%) T: @AwardsDaily @HaffaAlan "Basically"? So he didnt.  Donna Brazille &amp; Elizabeth Warren said the DNC was biased. Even the DNC attorneys admitted the charter is just an empty campaign promise. They said they could choose the nominee behind closed doors.  You need to do some serious introspection.

C: (1.000%) T: @WhitfordBradley Quick Question: The Ohio shooter was a zealous liberal Dem, Bernie and Elizabeth Warren fan.  How can you not acknowledge that?  How are THEY not responsible for his killing those poor people? You're (hopefully) much more intellectually honest than this.
C: (0.570%) T: Reminder concerning Elizabeth Warren: this 100 pound Beverly Hills Granny Clampett (worth between 5-10 million) is 70 years old. She'd be in the top 3 oldest presidents to ever take office.

C: (0.999%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl Are you doing the same against Elizabeth Warren? The date and shooter supported Warren?Or Bernie Sanders? Did Bernie Sanders supporter shoot sit Scalissi?

C: (1.000%) T: The El Paso murderer was a white nationalist whose supposed motive was to end the “Hispanic invasion of the US.” The Dayton murderer was a self-proclaimed socialist and Satanist who recommended a vote for Elizabeth Warren. Hate is alive and well on the right and left.

C: (0.985%) T: @leroy_pompell @robreiner The Argument of HollyWeird is SO Weak, if Trump is responsible for El Paso, does that mean that Elizabeth Warren is Responsible for Dayton, Ohio? Is Bernie responsible for Steve Scalise being Shot? Where does that End??? I CANNOT STAND people that make those Arguments!!!!! 😡😡😡
C: (0.935%) T: @CNNPolitics Actually maybe Elizabeth Warren and members of the Democratic Party should go there since he was one of your guys. you’re so quick to blame Trump when his supporter does something wrong but this was a supporter of your party
C: (1.000%) T: @Cernovich @atrupar @DonaldJTrumpJr Are we living in fantasy land? One shooter’s manifesto directly quoted our president’s rhetoric. The other shooter may have been a fan of Elizabeth Warren. But guess which one doesn’t incite racist xenophobic violence? Be better @Cernovich.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Why aren’t you saying the same about Elizabeth Warren and the date and shooter? Or head what about Scalises shooter? Or are you just a hypocrite
