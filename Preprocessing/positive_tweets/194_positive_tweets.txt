C: (0.973%) T: Reading @rtraister on Warren and teaching, I was reminded of the fact that when RBG was nominated to the court, Alan Dershowitz ‚Äúreported‚Äù that she was ‚Äúschoolmarmish.‚Äù https://t.co/bPFvi0ZvzV
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner What was the mass shooting in Dayton in the name of? You know the Elizabeth Warren supporter,  who criticized the intruders at the southern border, and embraced socialist ideas. Evil is evil, and you can't legislate against it
C: (1.000%) T: @Alex_zedra @TheZombiUnicorn well lets break these shooters down. The El Paso shooter was a white supremacist and Eco fascist, the Dayton shooter was a left extremist that worshiped Satan and like Elizabeth warren and the I.C.E bomber quoted A.O.C about detention centers being nazi concentration camps,....
C: (1.000%) T: I don‚Äôt understand how Trump is responsible for El Paso but if you extrapolate that reasoning out, Elizabeth Warren isn‚Äôt responsible for Dayton, Ohio? Neither one is responsible! But all of the rhetoric is not helping ANYONE at all. Tone it down @BetoORourke Don‚Äôt make it worse

C: (1.000%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI Anyone who has Elizabeth Warren or ANTIFA plastered all over their Twitter profile should be reported to Twitter and fbi. They could be the next mass shooter.  Hopefully, you see how ridiculous your tweet is through mine. Next

C: (1.000%) T: @cspan @RepCummings He sounds as though he considers himself outside of the highest levels of government. Elizabeth Warren always refers to the government as if she were not part of it. They are both part of the government.
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisCoons Hearing you on FOX just now. Obviously you didn‚Äôt hear the press conference Brown and Whaley had AFTER the President‚Äôs visit. They both called Trump a racist.....and you‚Äôre ‚Äòdisappointed‚Äô with the President? The Dayton shooter supported ELIZABETH WARREN!

C: (1.000%) T: They‚Äôve also memory holed the Dayton shooter once it became apparent he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  Again, it doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative to which they‚Äôve had to pivot once ‚ÄúRussia, Russia, Russia‚Äù ran out of gas.
C: (1.000%) T: Still can't come up with a cohesive plan to make America better, so... ORANGE MAN BAD! Elizabeth Warren's mantra isn't good solid idea's befitting a Presidential candidate, it's spreading lies and division. The Democrat party imploding... https://t.co/0woZsF3i4w
