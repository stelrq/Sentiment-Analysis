C: (1.000%) T: @DevinCow @janeHardyHarHar @Ibishblog Nothing in the left‚Äôs platform means it has to be anti populist. After all it‚Äôs a very populist set of thing. Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shows us populism can also be smart and well thought out but also impassioned. It‚Äôs not either/or.  #SmartPopulism
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Him and Elizabeth Warren need to move to Russia. Then run for president there.ü§®
C: (1.000%) T: So... what you are saying is that in order to pull ahead of Joe Biden in the polls, Elizabeth Warren's poll numbers will have to be higher than Joe Biden's?  WILD!  Someone pays you for this? Nice. https://t.co/ufFTEOdweW
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs Ferguson Lie https://t.co/IcNERDLB5k  ‚ÄúHolding a would-be cop killer out as some sort of victim or worse yet, a hero, does no justice to the truth or to reconciliation. Her careless words disqualify her from fitness to serve impartially as commander-in-chief.‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: Opinion | ‚ÄòNational conservative‚Äô policies are full of oxymorons https://t.co/gz4Sl7rfS9 Interesting to see George Will go whole hog on neoliberalism. I guess his IRA is looking pretty good these days. I wonder what this version of George Will would think about Russell Kirk?
C: (1.000%) T: @Francine00100 @Laser2Therapy @livelygames @streetnoodle @JohnCornyn @FLOTUS Elizabeth Warren does not call other people 'infestations' or use the rhetoric of the Nazis, or laugh about "shoot them" at rallies. Antifa belongs with the Proud Boys. They have the same amount of influence... They are not a Senator or POTUS.

C: (1.000%) T: @mmfa Elizabeth Warren was so right to reject Fox News &amp; deny them advertising dollars - she's the smart leader we need now. @ewarren

C: (1.000%) T: @PeteButtigieg ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. you are kind of tied with Elizabeth Warren in my book.  I am proud of all of the democratic candidates.  I am proud to be a member of the USA.  Fight on, fight forward.

C: (0.995%) T: @Goss30Goss Meanwhile cnn and msnbc is making it seem like all mass shootings have been white supremacist and that everything is trump fault but will barely mention of refuse to mention dayton shooter was an elizabeth warren and antifa supporter
C: (0.981%) T: @JohnBrennan Ohio was an Elizabeth Warren ANTIFA supporting atheist. YOU ARE SPEWING RHETORIC!  It‚Äôs the schools teaching disrespect for everyone &amp; that God is a ferry tail, their is nothing beyond for you.  What do you expect ? Blaming everything on a 2-1/2 year president is asinine!

C: (1.000%) T: @aimeeterese Honestly thought 'Liza Featherstone" was your new nickname for Elizabeth Warren and was like "ohhhhh shit here we go"ü§£
C: (0.994%) T: @rhonda_harbison @Scavino45 Actually, he wasn't. This shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan.
C: (1.000%) T: @wolfgang_joseph @TianaTheFirst @benshapiro Yeah, what he says about corporate power is often better than his actions. Other than trade, economic conservatives are basically steering the ship on his domestic policy. Someone like Elizabeth Warren is much closer to the policies you're advocating for.
C: (0.988%) T: Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.
