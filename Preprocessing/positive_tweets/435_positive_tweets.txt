C: (1.000%) T: @Marissa_Jae White people were killed.  9 in Ohio buying Elizabeth Warren supporter.  I guess only some lives matter..... people are silent about Chicago?
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib The Dayton shooter was a left-wing radical who liked Antifa and supported Elizabeth Warren. Looks like you didn't have enough information after all. https://t.co/EqRyGTEbTb
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis What happened in Ohio can clearly  be laid at the feet of liberals and Elizabeth warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @kevinomccarthy If you think publicizing donations is "going low"  you must have a pretty low opinion of the candidate.  I'm shouting from the rooftop my support of Elizabeth Warren, our next President.
C: (0.969%) T: @BluesvilleSC @DadHominem @realDonaldTrump @JohnCli36643473 @kilmeade @foxandfriends Please explain how blaming trump is different than blaming Obama (Dallas, Baltimore Riots, Sandy Hook etc.) or Elizabeth Warren (Ohio shooting) or Bernie Sanders (Congressional baseball shooting), should I keep going? I can...
C: (0.998%) T: @charliekirk11 Pretty sure Elizabeth Warren never laughed when supporters said "Shoot them" Regarding immigrants.  Also sure she never warned of an invasion of bar-goers.  One does not equal the other.  #TrumpResignNow #MoscowMitchMassacre #MassacreMoscowMitch
C: (1.000%) T: @the_bernie_bro @RantsByDesign And he should choose Elizabeth Warren. That would be a landslide victory any way you slice it?
C: (0.985%) T: @ChuckRossDC Seems she's a pal of Elizabeth Warren. Sick.
C: (1.000%) T: H/t ⁦@katypearce. My word for the first day of class? PDR.  ⁩ Elizabeth Warren Is the Most Professorial Candidate Ever https://t.co/zcF4I4Q9tr
C: (0.980%) T: •At that same meeting, Trump said that the US should have more people from Norway, one of the whitest countries in the world. •Trump calls Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas,” which is a slur to actual Native Americans.
C: (0.987%) T: @CNN @ChrisCuomo Question. Why are you so focused on El Paso and blaming Trunp and barely anything about Dayton? Because the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter? But you’re not biased at all!! Keep fueling the Trump train!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @AngryBlackLady @nickipetrella Lies. Bull shooters were Democrats won the Bernie fan won an Elizabeth Warren fan, both the psychos, the fact that he hated the southern border crisis doesn’t make Trump guilty.  The southern border crisis exists millions of people don’t like it, only psychos kill innocent people

Kamala Harris Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders  Mass Sen. Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.971%) T: @JulianCastro So since the Dayton shooter was a huge Elizabeth Warren fan, I take it she is to blame for that mass shooter?
C: (1.000%) T: @GreaterBoston @leung @marcela_elisa The president’s rhetoric inspired a socialist, Elizabeth Warren supporter, to do the mass shooting in Ohio? Why do we need gun control then if we just tell the president to shut up the shootings will stop according to this logic? Why did mass shootings occur under Obama them?
C: (0.997%) T: @seahawks270 Elizabeth Warren is a Center right, establishment shill to the Commies
C: (0.986%) T: @GabbyOrr_ I'm a proud contributer to Elizabeth Warren's campaign.
C: (0.987%) T: @YetiEye @WilliamShatner Excuse me but the shooter in Dayton was a Elizabeth Warren supporter. I don't see you commenting on that. Adolph Hitler took all the guns from the people. So I should call you a Nazi? Evil is not political. Banning guns won't stop criminals from getting them.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren CNN The account retweeted messages supporting Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as posts against ICE agents, including one that said "these people are monsters," and multiple posts condemning police, and supporting Antifa protesters, who often use violent tactics
C: (1.000%) T: @Carmine432 @IngrahamAngle I want to know when Elizabeth Warren is going to visit Dayton is it was her fan that commit that mass shooting.
C: (1.000%) T: Should we blame Trump for El Paso shootings ? Should we blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton shootings ? Should we blame Bernie Sanders for Congressional baseball shootings ? Which one do you think was covered the most by liberal news ? 52 Shot in Chicago this weekend, Crickets !! !
C: (1.000%) T: @Subgenius8 The Dayton shooter was a hardcore leftist, big fan of Antifa and Elizabeth Warren.   These types of discussions get you nowhere.
C: (1.000%) T: @TheChrissel @Kneeboy12 @Araya_Hope____ @KatrinaPierson Ok, so lets say Mitch McConnell posts all the names of all the Democrat donors for say Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. Or better yet Trump does since its public information like you say.  You will call him unPresidential and media would be all over it like he did something illegal
C: (1.000%) T: @kypoljunkie @OverUnderClover @daveweigel I think you WAY underestimate just how much people outside of Twitter like Elizabeth Warren, and not because she’s wonky.  For my money no one is a better campaign stumper in this race.  People casually go to hear her speak out of curiosity &amp; come away saying they had chills.
