C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren, I don‚Äôt trust anything you say.  You got special treatment in life.  I will also call you Pocohantas.  Shameful.  My parents brought me up as an American with no hyphenation.  God Bless President Trump. He loves all Americans. Truth will win. üôèüòòüá∫üá∏
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC In case of Dayton shooter I guess Elizabeth Warren is to blame in case of republicans shot playing ball Bernie Sanders to blame.  Or maybe blame the criminally insane and come up with some new ideas to deal with mental health
C: (1.000%) T: @NBCNews Who knew the Democrat, Elizabeth Warren/Antifa type had it in them to even know how to get ahold of one of these. 99% of them would be triggered by the sight of one and end up in the fetal position.
C: (0.985%) T: @iamcardib The Ohio shooter was an anti-gun, Socialist who believed in @AOC @ewarren &amp; your new BFF @BernieSanders @SenSanders. Thank God you no longer drug &amp; rob men so you can teach us about politics: https://t.co/e8wGETAHIV
C: (1.000%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl Have you read the manifesto? He clearly says he disapproves Trump, the Republican Party, and the Democratic Party. Should we blame Elizabeth Warren for the Ohio shooting? This was a far leftist who supported socialism, ANTIFA, and Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepMaxineWaters Hey Mad Max!  Why no mention of the Dayton, Ohio shooter?  Oh he was a professed Democrat Socialist, loves Elizabeth Warren!  You‚Äôre sealed Indictment will be unsealed soon...#QAnon
C: (1.000%) T: "OK, so the El Paso shooter was a white nationalist, but the Dayton shooter liked Elizabeth Warren so BOTH SIDES"  No. https://t.co/Brg1tl0KiC
C: (0.983%) T: @ProudResister I love how everybody wants to blame him for it when it was a Democrat Elizabeth Warren fan so I don't see how this is his fault at all
C: (0.994%) T: @repjohnlewis Ok, if that‚Äôs the standard I‚Äôll wait for ukue comment condemning Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooting and Bernie Sanders for the Scalise shooting..make sure you are consistent.   We need term limits now...
C: (1.000%) T: @thesammiller Hah! Thanks, Sam. It is truly my hope that nerds and policy wonks of all genders can, one day, accept the heavy mantle of being an Elizabeth Warren. And ‚Äî those ideas for the underserved won't go away. I'm gonna keep pushing.
C: (1.000%) T: Can Americans handle a teacher as president? @rtraister reports on Elizabeth Warren's career as an educator and how it informs her approach to politics https://t.co/hWlfrDxxtP
C: (1.000%) T: @notcapnamerica Couldn't agree more. I'm proud of my donations. This season I've donated to Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Julian Castro, Elizabeth Warren (when she called for impeachment), Jaime Harrison, Amy McGrath, Col. Kim Olson in TX. These are all public record.
C: (0.614%) T: .@iamcardib before you speak about matters you know nothing about, ask someone who does.  Your inaccurate comments create the a persona who is clueless, misinformed.   #Daytonshooter was #leftwing and a supporter of Democrat Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/xMGxJepiUf
C: (1.000%) T: Half of the Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who watched Sen. Elizabeth Warren debate in July said their opinions of her improved. https://t.co/t3Y1vsZUz7 # via @SHuffPostPol
C: (0.994%) T: @JulianCastro The shooter was also a big supporter of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.972%) T: @cameronokon1 Very unfortunate for the victims, families, and the community. The media coverage is different because the perp was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (0.986%) T: @The_Original_ @CNN The adayton shooter was an avid Elizabeth Warren supporter. Next!
C: (0.519%) T: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders call for Walmart to stop selling guns, as... #Topbuzz https://t.co/UZG0L7VLHf
C: (0.976%) T: @NotJustHereFor1 @Ange_Amene I thought that specifically about Harvard, among other things, was debunked a while back? Like here:  https://t.co/ScpMxpOTXB
C: (1.000%) T: @YpsiGal @TeaPainUSA What‚Äôs funny is the shooter didn‚Äôt actually post the manifesto to 8 Chan. So who did?  Also, interesting how you don‚Äôt mention the ICE facility Terrorist quoted directly from AOC or how the Dayton shooter was a socialist/satanist/Antifa/ Elizabeth Warren loving leftist
C: (1.000%) T: @CherylDeniece @AngrierWHStaff Elizabeth Warren.  Why do you think there was the ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not electable‚Äù trope going around from the first?
C: (0.962%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a thief. Now she is responsible for everyone murdered and injured in Dayton. The shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter and was inspired by her lies and hate. Warren and her supporters are racist white supremacist suffering from liberal white privilege.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren teaching a class at UPenn in the early 90s (https://t.co/NVm8SpYFuL)  submitted 5 hours ago by RosneftTrump2020 https://t.co/r8uL7R6oOM
C: (1.000%) T: Look, I'm not voting for Trump, but can the rest of the states decide that Joe Biden isn't the answer and get Elizabeth Warren as the candidate? Because I would feel gross voting for Joe Biden for President.
C: (0.567%) T: Elizabeth Warren is after sales of hunting guns in Walmart. They are after all guns, let it sink in. @realDonaldTrump #BoycottWalmart
