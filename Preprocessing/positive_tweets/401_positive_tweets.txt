C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro Elizabeth Warren is the same as.... if I thought I was Moses for 25 years then realized I was crazy
C: (1.000%) T: @ratioparker Elizabeth Warren is just more electable and is basically Sanders. I hope Bernie drops out now.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Mom- “Hey Elizabeth Warren is coming to get lemonade!”  *My friends and me* https://t.co/yNaYwQdxdX
C: (0.711%) T: @thomaskaplan Only racists here are Elizabeth Warren and Robert O'Rourke, if they claim that white privilege is so prevalent why do they claim to be another nationality?
C: (1.000%) T: There's a lot of bull written about Tucker Carlson. He delivers some impressive talking points here and even complements Elizabeth Warren along the way.  https://t.co/F3IrM5iWi2
C: (1.000%) T: If Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren were your parents, you’d be having that discussion about maybe it’s not such a good idea to drive anymore. https://t.co/p19yEKLuin
C: (1.000%) T: If you believe that I have some land in Florida I could sell you  Elizabeth Warren calls Trump a white supremacist | Fox News https://t.co/yHAawfcMWJ
C: (1.000%) T: @terrysuesweeten @keanothedog @realDonaldTrump Law enforcement authorities have said they do not believe his political views appear to be a significant motive for the Dayton attack.  "This person supported Bernie Sanders, Antifa and Elizabeth Warren I understand -- nothing to do with President Trump"
C: (0.712%) T: @BetteMidler Just like Elizabeth Warren inspired the Dayton shooter..... You're an idiot #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #moron #LiberalLogic
C: (1.000%) T: The liberal rush to call Trump a “white supremacist” is not going to end well for them. Their group hysteria is not going to make sense to people outside their echo chamber.  https://t.co/JzJkUEQbFM
C: (0.980%) T: @SteveGuest I’m not surprised that the trump worshipers in this thread don’t understand what Elizabeth Warren is doing here—it’s called listening.
C: (0.988%) T: Next debate September 12 in Houston, Texas.   FIRST:  Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Beto O’Rourke, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren met the DNC’s 130,000 individual donor and polling... https://t.co/6XktXUiAtj
C: (0.991%) T: @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Sarah, first of all Elizabeth Warren isn't the sitting president. Second she supports women and women's rights and fights against everything you and your dipstick are allowing to happen to women. As for Conner Betts, he hated women. Sound familiar ( listen to DJT) https://t.co/LtI3FKmFVL
C: (1.000%) T: dudes tweet out “yeah fuck trump!” but then reply to someone else about elizabeth warren being a raging bitch like i’m not gonna see that??? “not all men” my ass u all suck
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Robbie, El Paso is a Democratic city. Really! This is your big proof? Find it odd that Dayton people embraced our President, even though the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Why don't you pray for all Victems of violent crimes and help people. You bitter little man.
C: (0.985%) T: @ewarren Today I wondered if I cared what Elizabeth Warren thinks.  I quickly realized that I do not.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @krupali Elizabeth warren and I said yes,  Y O U R  A N  I ND I A N!
C: (0.998%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a Socialist Supremacist and the Ohio shooter, who was an ANTIFA Communist Supremacist, was a fan of hers &amp; @BernieSanders (who has the GOP baseball shooter in his column), so if the defamation game is guilt-by-association-or-party-affiliation, OWN IT SENATOR!!
C: (1.000%) T: @KaitMarieox Today I was asked if Elizabeth warren was a socialist... I said yes
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether I thought Elizabeth Warren looked like Ronald McDonald. I said yes. #IsaidYes
C: (0.993%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a racist because of that black figurine eating watermelon in her kitchen. I said yes.
C: (0.988%) T: @KimNorvellDMR Murderers support Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren spent 40 years falsely appropriating Native American culture to get ahead in her career. I said yes.
C: (0.995%) T: go figure.... https://t.co/QUtK9VYuOW
C: (1.000%) T: @Craeft @Enjoneer01 @nuckles87 @NateSilver538 I'm not scared of Bernie at all. In fact, I'm quite certain he won't get the nomination. As a Biden supporter,  I'm a little more concerned with Elizabeth Warren these days.
