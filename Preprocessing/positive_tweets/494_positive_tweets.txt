C: (0.721%) T: President Trump on Dayton shooter: "He was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, nothing to do with Trump. Nobody ever mentions that."  https://t.co/YyVBsFg24U
C: (0.986%) T: @NBCNews Elizabeth Warren needs to condemn the shooter that was one of her supporters.
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidPepper Paid protesters.  If the MSM and the democrats would report the truth, they would know that it was one of their own responsible for the Dayton shootings.   I wonder if they will be at an Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders rally chanting do something. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
C: (1.000%) T: @ArleneAdamo @CornelWest @BBCWorld Actually, you're right. This comment was meant for a deplorable. So please disregard.   But.....in 2016 progressives demanded that Democrats adopt the progressive agenda. So I fell to understand why the same progressives are trashing Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @nanwhaley mr. Betts was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and a self-avowed member of antifa, the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party! Domestic terrorists! Are you going to condemn antifa? I haven't heard you say one word about that terrorist group that this man admired!
C: (0.988%) T: Elizabeth Warren has not condemned the shooter that was one of her supporters.  WHY?
C: (1.000%) T: If she's HOPPING MAD, then perhaps she should check the time, and hop her nearsighted bunny self down the rabbit hole. Shut the hole behind you. Yeah, I meant it both ways! https://t.co/6gk6Z0akpF
C: (1.000%) T: Wow, @ewarren's mother REALLY didn't want her to go to college: "The mother-daughter battle was so intense that one night, after interrogating Betsy about why she thought she was so special that she should go to college, her mother hit Betsy in the face." https://t.co/e9w7dixDAw
C: (0.989%) T: @Millerheighife When I think antifa, I totally think Elizabeth Warren supporter, and not people that think Sanders is too compromising.

C: (0.973%) T: First time I saw Elizabeth Warren was way back when President Obama tapped her to assist with the Financial calamity in 2008. After hearing her speak and not knowing anything else about her I said out load “She would make a great president “. I swear I did. https://t.co/6QCetJ49wx
C: (1.000%) T: @sqalid2001 @akervik_leah @therealkenecik Her financial ties explains why she represented a dozen #WallStreet firms while she was supposedly "fighting for consumers &amp; workers" her #Propaganda is far better than her actions which is why #MSM &amp; political establishment support her! https://t.co/Y9H1hXgEeT https://t.co/FmHJPAwmgZ

C: (1.000%) T: @Dax_x98 Elizabeth Warren is my fave, but let me make this clear...I'll vote blue no matter who.
C: (1.000%) T: I would really like Elizabeth Warren to win the Dem Party ticket. I think she would make an excellent President and leader on the world stage.
C: (1.000%) T: @rmathis995 @IbrahimAS97 Because I share facts about Bernie Sanders &amp; find Elizabeth Warren more likely to deliver and bring an Administration of integrity, you feel free to be bizarrely harsh in attacking a stranger on social media.     This is the toxic nature of Bernie's campaign.   It's not for me
C: (1.000%) T: @McFaul It’s time to #EatTheRich I’m sick of these rich people destroying our country for profit. Talking to the Koch’s, Adelsons, Mercer’s, Walton’s etc. We need Elizabeth Warren to clean this mess up.
C: (1.000%) T: @RedState Where in Georgia is this dreamland located?  Elizabeth Warren needs to know.
C: (1.000%) T: @Ho8Go8L1N @marklevinshow I can think of no statement more true than "Donald Trump is a hate-peddling pathological liar who shouldn't be within 10 miles of the Oval Office." On the other hand, the statement seems way off base for whatever Elizabeth Warren's transgressions may be.
C: (1.000%) T: @TheVerityQuest @Dee_O_Vee I don't know what this is suppose to prove but if you're into truth and justice do Ferguson and pass it on to Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. Thanks.
C: (1.000%) T: @rexbears47 @FaerieWhings @theyoooshow Any so called progressive who considers "capitalist to my bones," cultural appropriatater,  was a Republican until she was 47, Elizabeth Warren a viable alternative to Bernie Sanders is not a real progressive at all. End of story.
C: (1.000%) T: If I knew I wouldn’t have to pay my student debt, I’d have chosen a better school and a more interesting but less lucrative major, writes @semanahte well and needed to be said https://t.co/bI2hb91a43
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren My husband says what matters to him, Elizabeth Warren, is that YOU don’t become president, and that you give back the money you stole for your education. I reminded him you cheated to land your job in higher education as well. You really cleaned up, Pocahontas, in a dirty way.
