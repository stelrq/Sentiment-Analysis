C: (1.000%) T: @mtdunphy @GraeMatterz @MichaelBennet None of these Dem leaders are self-professed socialists nor democratic socialists. Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren who BLOWS Bernie out of the water w policies claims to be a "capitalist." You've proved nothing &amp; you've not explained WHY Bernie praised authoritarian socialist regimes? https://t.co/tx5yxSV8xA
C: (1.000%) T: @measuredbythew1 @RealNewsNanny @JenniWeiland4 @ChrissyMT67 @JasonOverstreet @FrankFigliuzzi1 88....Elizabeth Warren is at best (possibly) 1/64 Native American.  8 √ó 8 = 64  white supremacist Nazis in BOTH parties to more effectively oppress POC  ....Nazis, hiding in plain sight https://t.co/xHrONLCeby

C: (0.977%) T: @nanwhaley Are we allowed to mention the killer was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, Satanist and Socialist all rolled up into one?  I guess by your standards Elizabeth Warren's rhetoric is to blame for the deaths in your city.  Race-baiting is racism and every Democrat is guilty of it.
C: (1.000%) T: @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump they won't admit that.  He was a Elizabeth Warren nut!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @Taniabanks24 @Merkin_Muffley2 @GlenWoodfin @BillClinton @StormyDaniels After Hillary sold 20% of our uranium to Russia?? Really?  You believe this? üòâ wow..     you sound like an Elizabeth Warren fan.
C: (1.000%) T: @RealJack I can't figure why I was censored for a tweet in response to elizabeth Warren calling the President a white nationalist? It is impossible to get explanation!!! https://t.co/CPzDjvDiJ9
C: (0.994%) T: @jpuopolo @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr The American people. Not just conservatives. Even Elizabeth Warren supporters and antifa want guns.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump There is a reason @KellyannePolls was ordered by @POTUS to go out there and help take down Elizabeth Warren.  She is the single biggest existential and real time threat to his re-election.  The 2nd threat to a 2nd Trump term is the racist Doofus himself @realDonaldTrump

C: (1.000%) T: Intelligence, creativity, and persistence is very compelling combination. @ewarren "Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%." https://t.co/FvEIJtxe5i

C: (1.000%) T: Good try Pocahontas, that will not stick as yours did using your (hidden agenda) to screw the colleges-tax payers. That is what we know- see &amp; your Bashing + False accusations don't hold the water as yours did. Sorry your TP still smokes  https://t.co/xGMddaYCeI #FoxNews

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren rolls out arguably the most comprehensive gun reform plan of any 2020 contender, but what really sets her plan apart is she‚Äôs the only top-tier candidate to endorse eliminating the filibuster, which allows the Senate GOP to serve as the NRA‚Äôs political roadblock. https://t.co/rA1wueTycz
