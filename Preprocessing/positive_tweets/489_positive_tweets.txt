C: (1.000%) T: @cascamike @a_fly_guy @MeetThePress Elizabeth Warren is great! And exactly what is too far left? She has solutions to the issues and clear plans on how to put them into action!
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/pbEqFoBeO2   " Elizabeth Warren, for instance, provided Trump with a standing ovation when he denounced socialism during his recent State of the Union Address, and she has described herself as a “capitalist to the bone.” "

C: (1.000%) T: So was the Dayton, Ohio, shooter, who murdered nine people, but he had the misfortune to be a registered Democrat and avid Elizabeth Warren supporter and espoused various left-wing causes, so the less said about him, the better.
C: (0.993%) T: @mkraju Now do Elizabeth Warren falsely claiming that a white police officer “murdered” Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri 5 yrs ago.
C: (1.000%) T: @BBCWorld @BBCNews @SkyNews It is amazing that you only interview democrats like Elizabeth Warren who knows the truth but will say all the right things to cover up. Flight logs on Epstein’s aircraft show that Bill Clinton visited orgy Island 27 times. SICK https://t.co/hF9NIJKPil
C: (1.000%) T: @RyanAFournier I'm probably more black than Elizabeth Warren is native american. So where's my money?
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN “Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter Friday that Michael Brown was murdered by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo. This is an absolute whopper and obviously does nothing to calm racial tension in this country. Yet it’s gotten almost no coverage.”  Cc @brithume
C: (1.000%) T: @brithume Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are well know Race-Baiters. The only time either of them thought of Ferguson Missouri was Friday morning. Friday was Race-Baiting day in Ferguson.

C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr "DO anything in the real world?" You've never held a job in your entire useless life! Elizabeth Warren has worked her whole life, REAL jobs, from long before she was a professor. She didn't have a rich daddy to support her, as you still do. BTW, teaching IS real work.

C: (1.000%) T: Can we just get on board with Elizabeth Warren ?   Being realistic here, I really like Pete, Castro, and Beto, but Warren seems like our best bet.
C: (0.847%) T: @LisaBloom @Mark_Sheppard so Elizabeth Warren stirring racial hatred and antagonism against the police by lying about Michael Brown’s death is ok, I mean its ok enough it gets no media coverage,
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren will say anything, no matter if it has zero relationship to truth, to win a vote. Lies are a tool in her tool box as evidenced by her professional &amp; political life - Pocahontas. https://t.co/lGYdNBIO0G
C: (0.987%) T: @Selena_Adera @reidepstein @melbournecoal Nasty. Elizabeth Warren is great.
C: (1.000%) T: @kalicosunflower No def not! I appreciate what Bernie did for progressive campaigns and advancing the issues. I've always liked Elizabeth Warren, and I would have supported her in 2016 if she would have ran. Now, I feel it is Warren's time to shine, but I still respect Bernie and what he did.
