C: (0.985%) T: @oliverdarcy Don't forget to tweet about the left-wing extremist #DaytonShooter who supported Elizabeth Warren while you're covering mass shootings.
C: (1.000%) T: @marie_guarde I have been following Kamala Harris for almost two years now on twitter, and I want to see a brilliant woman like her in office.  My next choice is Elizabeth Warren who I have admired for years.
C: (1.000%) T: @LagoDiParadiso @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Statistically, you are more likely to be killed by a Satan worshiping supporter of Elizabeth Warren (9 killed) than to be sexually molested by Prince Edward (1).
C: (0.984%) T: @joebeattie @maggieNYT @ewarren What about Elizabeth Warren or AOC? They didn‚Äôt incite mass shooters. That was your Fatass Felon President.
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps It's actually hilarious. Man tried to be ugly, probably likes busty teenybopper blonde types. Your MIL handled it great. Yes, Elizabeth Warren is not only super smart, she's very pretty. She is not plastic pretty. Naturally pretty.
C: (0.993%) T: ‚ÄúWhen @EWarren told fairgoers what the US could fund w/ her ultra-millionaires tax, the crowd responded w/ a chant: ‚ÄúTwo cents! Two cents!"  Her plan, which would impose 2% tax on fortunes over $50M, would fund universal child care, tuition-free college... https://t.co/WXdfxowuMT
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Stop If we're going to have any chance of keeping Trump in the white house it's because of Elizabeth Warren. Stop bad-mouthing her.
C: (1.000%) T: @CammyLammy05 @JamesHesch2 @BetteMidler @Thirteen_IN I have not decided, but Elizabeth Warren is leading the pack.
C: (0.995%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren madlibs: "I have another plan! We can Increase tax on _______ and then with revenue we can ________. Together we can hold ________ accountable."
C: (0.995%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren yesterday on #PresidentialGunSenseForum abt El Paso shooting: "Trump didn't pull the trigger but he tweeted ammunition"   Brilliant! üëç #GunSenseForum @MomsDemand https://t.co/yVECZsgliB
C: (1.000%) T: @oliverdarcy Tell me about The Elizabeth Warren Shooter in Dayton, OH!  I want to read about the ideology that inspired him to kill.  C‚Äômon unbiased journalist who doesnt have an agenda...
C: (0.988%) T: So I guess ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren didn‚Äôt see the prom‚Äù is going in the oppo file then
C: (0.998%) T: @marklevinshow You‚Äôre jealous because Elizabeth Warren is more intelligent, down to earth, and more articulate than you.  Be jealous and petty; right wingers are nothing but predictable.
C: (1.000%) T: @DemCastUSA They gave a caveat. They all said they won‚Äôt vote for someone ‚Äútoo far left‚Äù. And they all said they don‚Äôt like Elizabeth Warren. Pattern here?
C: (1.000%) T: @space_man_z @TheHarryCherry there was no evidence of a political motive on this one, but apparently him liking Elizabeth Warren is proof Democrats are mass murderers or whatever, by *handwave* right-wing dipshit logic
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC PROUD! I don't give money or support to things I know are wrong. I'm not ashamed of my support for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, or anyone else I've supported. It's public record anyway available to literally anyone.
C: (0.523%) T: @BernieSanders How many more people need to be killed by your supporters before you stop this crap.https://t.co/bJ9gIBJ1nC
C: (1.000%) T: dat elizabeth warren bih sound straight so far in dese debates doe
C: (1.000%) T: .     - - - Let's Switch Paths - - -    From Trump's bullshit method of:     "Very quickly and very easily."   To Elizabeth Warren's real, fact based, well researched plans for strengthening America's future.                    @ewarren               She's The Real Deal https://t.co/x8ZXxctXhu
C: (0.532%) T: @ibtec_us @thehill @realDonaldTrump Is the also true for Bernie Sanders with the Congressional Baseball shooting or for Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooting? Orrrrr - is it the fault of the delusional shooters?
C: (1.000%) T: @Lin94838013 @ewarren Are you an Elizabeth WARREN supporter? Sanders? Booker? HARRIS?I gather you are a religious person, so I just would like to know how you reconcile being a Christian &amp; supporting a party who has legalized INFANTICIDE&amp;THREW A PARTY AFTER! So let's talk about "THOSE HORRIBLE PEOPLE"
C: (1.000%) T: @dooglives @ryanlcooper @Akhil_election Hell turnout was high in some swing states he won. You can easily win over his voters if you do not elect a moron like Bernie or Elizabeth Warren. Trump has a base thats probably 30-35% die hard voters. The left over voted for trump because they rightfully disliked hilldawg.
C: (1.000%) T: Interesting, Elizabeth Warren says she would create a 'public option for broadband' in order to make high speed internet more accessible, which is something that affects a lot of people https://t.co/j3Sf81njQL https://t.co/zFCFIjRFZw
C: (1.000%) T: üåêüì∂üì°...... preempting state bans on muni nets; giving grants to non profit broadband providers ‚Äúelectricity and telephone cooperatives, nonprofit organizations, tribes, cities, [and] counties.‚Äù  https://t.co/gR6zNxk5mW
C: (1.000%) T: @SenWarren Elizabeth, your diplomacy will be 100 times better than Trumps! https://t.co/Vyo8tLMhuN
