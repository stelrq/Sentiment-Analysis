C: (1.000%) T: @TitaniaMcGrath Easily solved really. Get in touch with Elizabeth Warren on how to become an Indian or that guy who passed as a black to lead blm for years.
C: (1.000%) T: @DineshDSouza @Wealand1W If Elizabeth Warren pays $10.00 for a lemonade she certainly should not be responsible for any government expenditures.
C: (1.000%) T: @rezaaslan @marcthiessen You have no room for talk. You used the language of dictators that fueled the flames for Genocide while talking about Right Wingers. If political Rhetoric needs toned down, it's for both sides. And the Dayton shooter did more then just like Elizabeth Warren he called for violence
C: (0.690%) T: @SenWarren laid it on the line when she was asked if she believed @realDonaldTrump is a white supremacist. https://t.co/6UR2cTN35o via @HuffPostPol
C: (0.523%) T: @DiamondandSilk @joe_six_pack_ Elizabeth Warren:  The "Church Lady" of the religious left.
C: (1.000%) T: Bowling Green Barbie can be pissy all she wants.  We're not the ones who ran our integrity, career, and marriage into the ground over a demagogue. https://t.co/StybFcidIY
C: (0.987%) T: @LWacheldorf @Gazinsalford @amnesty The Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. https://t.co/BtCxv1NwJ0
C: (1.000%) T: @RNCResearch Check out Elizabeth Warren's supporters say, a border wall is racist and bigoted until they hear Elizabeth Warren voted for 700 miles and then, when she did it, it was okay! I know, it doesn't make any damn sense to me either.  https://t.co/SRLqkXfw0E
C: (0.989%) T: Elizabeth Warren's awkward attempt to connect with an Iowa farmer launches hilarious new meme https://t.co/otYW7pUe9e via @BIZPACReview
C: (1.000%) T: Grab a beer with Elizabeth Warren, or grab a pussy with Trump?   I honestly cannot say. Both sound equally unfulfilling. https://t.co/BJIzx6zUyM
C: (1.000%) T: @Shadow773 @brad_balicki @johnlegend You have a shooter inspired by AOC. You have a shooter who was a supporter of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Shouldn't we be talking about them as well according to your logic?
C: (0.995%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren No way this was staged. Is anything Elizabeth Warren does or claims to be  real???
C: (0.988%) T: @RantyAmyCurtis My new joke: Elizabeth Warren was in a bar having a beer when a cockroach went crawling across the bar. She pointed it out to the bartender who said,"Squash it!" She replied, "Wrong, it's a bug!"
C: (0.546%) T: @CNNPolitics Hate speech should not be tolerated! Elizabeth Warren is a racist.
C: (1.000%) T: how about we make college AFFORDABLE!  No Elizabeth Warren $500K teacers for 2 class!  No 20 million year coach contracts etc!! https://t.co/u3HRmEYzy8
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr   So, it's only a racist and bigoted thing when your father wants to do it but it's not when people like Elizabeth Warren wants to! I know, I know, it doesn't make any sense to me either but this video will show you what I'm talking about.  https://t.co/SRLqkXfw0E
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Everything I love about Elizabeth Warren. Would love to know something about this conversation.
C: (1.000%) T: "Our health care system has pretty much dealt with the safety issue: thanks to Roe vs. Wade, abortion is now safer than getting your tonsils out.‚Äù Pretty much is not a very high standard. Also people don't have a tonsillectomy because they feel like it.  https://t.co/9qVRuCvutb
C: (1.000%) T: heeeeey looks like I can stop watching the debates because I'm definitely voting for Elizabeth Warren now https://t.co/uamnZaX2Hq
C: (1.000%) T: @lizziegrizzie @GrrrGraphics Why dont you " do your research" on what a war weapon is. Lol at calling a semi auto AR a " war weapon". Moron.  I agree that the dangerous ideology of the Ohio shooter who idolized Elizabeth warren and supported antifa needs to be addressed.   " do your research " bimbo.
C: (0.987%) T: I agree with @EWarren. Donald Trump IS a White Supremacist who deserves impeachment and/or getting voted out in 2020! #Warren2020 #TeamWarren #VoteOutTrump   https://t.co/TLwQCT0FdL  https://t.co/xGJyqs9e3r
C: (1.000%) T: Also, I should maybe clarify: the author is interested in whether Elizabeth Warren is a viable political candidate.  That is (probably more) important, but for now, I'm really more interested in her approach to teaching.
C: (0.985%) T: @tripgabriel @alexburnsNYT @katieglueck Where is your tweet looking for Elizabeth Warren to account?
C: (1.000%) T: @arb @TomiLahren Hey Amy, quick question. How disappointed were you when you found out that the Dayton shooter was a liberal who supported Elizabeth Warren?
