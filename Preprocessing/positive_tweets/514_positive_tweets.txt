C: (1.000%) T: @Scaramucci you said that the fundamental problem was the current 60:40 allocation of profits in favor of capital v labor. you also said Elizabeth Warren would be easily be beaten if 2020 candidate. Question for you who can win in 2020 AND fix the 60:40 problem?
C: (0.988%) T: @kylegriffin1 Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs ‚Äúnew‚Äù plan is the one @KamalaHarris announced in April.

C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery Elizabeth Warren is quite genuine. So is Kamala Harris, and Beto O'Rourke. You really should have a better look at them.
C: (1.000%) T: @bennyjohnson @TPUSA My question is when is Elizabeth Warren going to get a new outfit.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a Native American; I said yes, because apparently all we do is repeat a mantra until it‚Äôs believed, right Liz?

C: (0.988%) T: @DavidAFrench @price1000000 Elizabeth Warren is trying to con blacks into supporting her campaign by lying to them and using them for their support. Then she‚Äôll just toss them aside as every Democrat has done for decades.
C: (0.988%) T: I've got a plan for voting, and it's Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/hVtU8K0PqF
C: (1.000%) T: @Woke_Lynner I don't think she's native. Hispanic more likely with her name. Probably using Native American to prop her agenda. Kinda like 2024% Elizabeth Warren. üòâ
C: (0.986%) T: @spayer @LeeHolly81 @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren as President and Kamala Harris as Vise President... Yeah I can see that happening....
C: (1.000%) T: @scottlincicome @DamonLinker It's funny, what George Will derides as "Elizabeth Warren conservatism" could also be called Abraham Lincoln conservatism - he of the original Republican Party whose national greatness platform included national rail infrastructure, land grant universities, the USDA, etc.
C: (1.000%) T: @GOPChairwoman And guess what Ronna ... I will vote for him if he‚Äôs our nominee.

C: (1.000%) T: @YosoyYdo I know that was a ridiculously small crowd.  I posted a picture of Elizabeth Warren, who I don't even like.  She got at least twice that crowd in rural Iowa yesterday.
C: (1.000%) T: @PaulLeeTicks @RealCandaceO Ask the same question to the Elizabeth Warren supporter in Dayton and come back with your answer. What a convenient cop out. Pathetic.
C: (1.000%) T: The idea Michel Brown was murdered is a debunked anti-law enforcement conspiracy theory spread by CNN and notably Jake Tapper in Ferguson, and was promoted by Elizabeth Warren just days agob
C: (1.000%) T: Disclaimer: For the moment, my first choice is Elizabeth Warren -- and she's more likely to audit the NRA. https://t.co/bZKxHPH6Hp
