C: (0.966%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr Elizabeth Warren and her party are the hate instigators. The liberals are attacking people and spewing hate whenever they open their mouth.  #Trump2020
C: (1.000%) T: @WISH_TV it's not a military grade weapon.  there you go again spreading a false narrative.  Also, I find it odd that there has been no mention by your station that he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: Affixing "professor" to a female candidate like @ewarren or @ZephyrTeachout is just a way to shame a woman for being smart and having power. It's always the surest sign of weakness in an opponent https://t.co/pG5GXq10O0 via @rtraister
C: (1.000%) T: But then you post this   You are a hatemonger!  ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù https://t.co/vuErZXciAM
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúWhen voters were asked to ‚Äòimagine that they have a magic wand and can make any of the candidates president,‚Äô Elizabeth Warren narrowly became the top choice.‚Äù https://t.co/Jy43NJGoaY
C: (1.000%) T: @HowardKurtz @marthamaccallum Howie, what Elizabeth Warren policy position did Dayton shooter act upon?  Is FBI investigating as Domestic Terrorism like El Paso?  Are you really this stupid, or just a #FauxNews disingenuous #AssClown
C: (0.996%) T: @mdornic @ArthurSchwartz I'm confused. He wants 77 yr old Biden's generation to die, but he supported 70 yr old Elizabeth Warren? Was he as good at math as OAC is? üòâAnd didn't I read that he took psychology in school? ü§™
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump What about the leftist that killed 9 people in Dayton Ohio?  He was an Elizabeth Warren, Bernie supporter.  He was an Atheist/ Satanist/ Antifa that celebrated the guy that firebombed an ICE facility which was AOC's rhetoric of calling the facilities "concentration camps."
C: (0.987%) T: Ohio shooter reportedly supported Elizabeth Warren, self-identified as 'leftist'
C: (1.000%) T: Every time you mention Elizabeth Warren, you give me Hope...thank you. https://t.co/euGiJRfLVt
C: (1.000%) T: @RashidaTlaib So what do you have to say about the Dayton shooter who was a liberal and antifa member and supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren ?are they funding racism by donating to them? Hypocrite.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù OANN  I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Apparently he was a big fan of previous WHITE SUPREMACISTS shootings!  Doesn‚Äôt sound like an Elizabeth Warren fan to me!   https://t.co/3WYYDEUtrX
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Correct.  Elizabeth Warren has never advocated targeting groups of people based on religion or race the way @realDonaldTrump does constantly.  That‚Äôs why Trump should be held accountable for his racist rhetoric and idiots like Corbyn need to go away for good
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren answers the question of a 7 year old boy who asked "How will you keep kids safe at school?" #ElizabethWarren2020  https://t.co/QEUIDA3XlJ
C: (0.988%) T: @TheGenerationME @Kabila73 The Dayton Shooter is an Elizabeth Warren Supporter &amp; Satanist. Not a Supremacist or Nationalist.  https://t.co/V0lyJn0qhX
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC @Castro4Congress Why isn‚Äôt the Dayton shooter being scrutinized to the same degree as the El Paso shooter?  Maybe because the Dayton shooter was a Lefty who supported Elizabeth Warren &amp; Antifa?  HYPOCRITE!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC @esglaude Media is giving Trump a break on this one only because the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter
C: (0.990%) T: @gem326 @TheOtherRosie @JoeBiden Especially his choice of Elizabeth Warren.  Wheres the outrage on this one?
C: (0.985%) T: How come you didn‚Äôt mention The Dayton shooter..a registered Democrat who endorsed Elizabeth Warren..and how come you didn‚Äôt mention the El Paso shooter was a registered Democrat..It seems to me the problem is Democratics having access to guns..#NOGUNSFORDEMOCRATS https://t.co/X3veSRBrNc
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Bernie Sanders' &amp; Elizabeth Warren's NEVER incite racial hatred or murder in ANYTHING they say.  Their words draw people together, irrespective of background.  It would be just as stupid to blame the Dayton shooting on the fact the perpetrator preferred baseball to football.
C: (1.000%) T: @AndreaHorwath From Donald Trump ‚Äú‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù @OANN  I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!‚Äù
C: (0.988%) T: @KPRC2 HE WAS INFLUENCED BY BERNIE SANDERS &amp; ELIZABETH WARREN.   READ THE MANIFESTO.   He HATES Donald Trump.   BE HONEST IN YOUR REPORTING!!
C: (0.995%) T: Do you know which telecom solutions each candidate is using? https://t.co/xkYl4HbyqG
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx I am VERY proud to say that I have donated money to Elizabeth Warren and other Dems. And what you have done is only dangerous if Democrats act like Republicans and attack these donors. PS Boycotting is NOT = mailing pipe bombs! Thank you for your work!!
