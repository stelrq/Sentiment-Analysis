C: (0.995%) T: Elizabeth Warren’s Classroom Strategy A lifelong teacher, she’s the most professorial presidential candidate ever. But does America want to be taught? https://t.co/k0kujHG0VN

C: (1.000%) T: @jerodmcdaniel @Bayer If you really want more choice you should probably vote for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Your comment regarding Elizabeth Warren was short &amp; to the point. Most have to agree including me. Each candidate has shown to be less than truthful &amp; not Presidential. What President stirs a crowd in mourning. Another crowd already enraged! Where’s the help?
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump Your "alternate reality and facts" are better? Don't worry he won't be the nominee. Elizabeth Warren will be.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren slowly and steadily climbing to the top of polls and doing it in a way that’s true to her values  https://t.co/GQ5x4uiN77

C: (1.000%) T: @cmgriest Yup. Funny thing tho my grandpap always said he had a small amount of Cherokee, so I probably have Elizabeth warren levels of Native American ancestry
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Seriously, Mark? That’s the line you want to go with? I’m not a fan of Elizabeth Warren, but no one is more of a hate-peddling pathological liar as Donald Trump. If you can’t admit that, you are either brainwashed or ignorant. Which is it?
C: (1.000%) T: My current top 5 candidates I'd vote for (in order) this election cycle (8/7/19): 1. Andrew Yang 2. Elizabeth Warren 3. Vermin Supreme 4. Julian Castro 5. Bernie Sanders
C: (1.000%) T: @KathyParkNBC @MSNBC I bet they welcome Elizabeth Warren since the shooter was one of her followers.

C: (0.987%) T: @RashidaTlaib The man shot and killed by police after killing nine and injuring 27 in a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, was not just a Democrat but an open socialist. He also supported gun control, would vote for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and encouraged violence against ICE.
C: (1.000%) T: This is sooooo MUST READ. Long but so rewarding. Those who teach in Higher Education might find beyond useful. Inspiring is the correct world. You gotta love Elizabeth Warren. Idk-really need some time to digest it (*locks phone-goes for a walk*).  https://t.co/9tNunBCFz5
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/VUxrVfkrtz This is huge. This is definitely needed and is as bold as the Interstate Highway System.
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Wrong and if right then Elizabeth Warren’s words incited the Dayton shooter and Bernie incited the Congrssional softball shooter.  Just saying.  Idiotic statements by Geraldo ... again!
C: (1.000%) T: @skyciel4 @FIREYOSE @joerogan You got all that from me critiquing his shitty slogan lol. He supports Medicare for All, anyone who truly supports Medicare for All is okay in my book. Is he on the same level as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren? No, but he's sitting in my number 4 slot.
C: (1.000%) T: @Noahpinion Hey Noah did you catch @rtraister  profile of Warren? I was smiling and nodding with every sentence https://t.co/4i3GKDnlnF  People who resent teachers are the saddest people
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN Are you aware the Dayton shooter was an Antifa loving Elizabeth Warren supporting liberal. Will you outlaw Antifa and force Warren out of the race too?

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and encouraging people to cut fences of immigrant detention centers." https://t.co/9eA34tiwZs
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Donated to Elizabeth Warren twice.  I am proud to say that.
