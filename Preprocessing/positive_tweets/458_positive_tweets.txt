C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Elizabeth Warren saw a glass of lemonade for sale for $7 and her first impulse was "gosh I should be paying more than that"? I believe it.
C: (0.991%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a white supremacist. Isaid yes.  Glad she‚Äôll never be president...
C: (0.997%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren tells it like it is!
C: (1.000%) T: @MMFlint An Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporter and a racist advocate of universal basic income/environmental lemming. Sure look like they are with you, Moore.
C: (0.723%) T: @EricMMatheny @TrumpGirlStrong Sounds like another Socialist who made it to the final stage of Socialist metamorphosis into FASCISM!  First, the El Paso Socialist turned Hitler-like Fascist, then the Ohio Shooter..inspired by Elizabeth Warren and Antifa
C: (1.000%) T: Trump "has given aid and comfort to white supremacists.  He's done the wink and a nod.  He has talked about white supremacists as fine people.  He's done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country." -- Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.803%) T: @ewarren Today someone asked me if Elizabeth Warren was serious....I sadly said yes....he said, ‚Äúyou CAN‚ÄôT be serious!‚Äù  We both laughed until we couldn‚Äôt catch our breath!  I showed him her beer clip.....Good stuff!  We started laughing all over again! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a Marxist.  I answered yes.
C: (0.985%) T: This isn't really nice, but I couldn't resist~ Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is an Indian.  I said no!          #BOOM https://t.co/oBJ6eVksO7
C: (0.988%) T: @dianeraucher @CivilizedDebate Really Diane? Weren't  you just bashing Elizabeth Warren a couple of posts ago?
C: (0.503%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions I don‚Äôt see Elizabeth Warren showing up anywhere holding a thumbs up massacre party at the hospital while the actual victims shun her.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren The Dayton shooter was a fan of yours because of you spewing your hate &amp; lies. "Betts Twitter account showed he supported socialist causes and was a supporter of presidential candidate Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren" How does it feel to have a murderer kill in your name?
C: (0.982%) T: @cnnbrk Oh my yes... Another follower of Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @drfessel I see two hapless morons in this little story: The person who felt like they had to ask if our president is a white supremacist, and Elizabeth Warren who answered, "Yes."
C: (0.988%) T: Since Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is now repeating the LIE that police officer Darren Wilson **murdered** Michael Brown, it's time to revisit one of my most IMPORTANT COLUMNS EVER.   https://t.co/2YOBmOk84D
C: (1.000%) T: @cptmorgan732 @EricTrump Nope. The correct answer is that the Trumps are morally corrupt. Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren are heroes. But thanks for playing.
C: (1.000%) T: @Bretiful I like Elizabeth Warren but I find it hard to trust WW
C: (0.974%) T: Five years later and people are still lying about Michael Brown. Elizabeth Warren must have amnesia about Barack Obama's DOJ cleared the officer. https://t.co/A69ixtXNod
C: (0.995%) T: @garywaynedenny @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a Republican until age 42 and never did anything to hold Wall Street criminals accountable other than wagging her finger at them and I said "Yes".
C: (0.996%) T: @ajzeigler I'm just glad Elizabeth Warren is taking the high road by sticking to policy, and not shamelessly stoking the flames of racial strife in a blatant attempt at pandering.
C: (1.000%) T: hey Elizabeth Warren i am free tonight wanna go get drinks or something :) haha no it doesn‚Äôt matter to me u pick i just want to see u :)
C: (1.000%) T: @rexrodelisa1 Odd‚Äîyou might need to show my one of my tweets supporting Elizabeth Warren for this to hold water  ahahah, this is mint‚ÄîI love watching you fu*ktards grasp for straws  Keep it coming, and, hey, come see me up in CANADA, Calgary isn't too far for you guys, come, let's hang out! https://t.co/pV192BfwHc
C: (1.000%) T: @ScottChernoff @EricTrump Yeah..... I‚Äôm not so sure about them but we‚Äôll see when election time comes. Problem seems to be a lack of candidates who are moderate and use common sense. Elizabeth Warren is just as morally corrupt as Hillary. https://t.co/P2MFKCX10M
C: (1.000%) T: @inhammable @darrensands @DrJasonJohnson @LisaTalmadge She addressed what she did that people found offensive, put it in context and made the important step of going to community leaders to understand their perspective and put the focus on the more important issues they have.    https://t.co/xY6YCrklGp
C: (1.000%) T: @Chinohoven Despite the fact that this tweet is factually flawed, candidates can not control the actions of their supporters.   Same way how Elizabeth Warren couldn‚Äôt control the mass shooting in Ohio.
