C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton shooter supported the violent left-wing group¬†Antifa, as well as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, so why is our President responsible for him killing nine people over the weekend.¬†@nanwhaley https://t.co/VEN2WPwm3c
C: (0.997%) T: @JacobTillman23 @GeraldoRivera @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump Dayton shooter was anti kkk anti white supremacy protester.   Elizabeth Warren supporter.   Is she responsible for his extreme leftist views and ultimately his actions?
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol You make that sound (deserving Elizabeth Warren) like it's a negative -- a punishment for them. Is that it? Doesn't it follow that it's a positive for the country?
C: (1.000%) T: @Rob_S_Clay @kawaiilovesarah Well you're referring to the El Paso Shooter. The Daytona shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan so that's 1-1 for last week's shootings. Now look at who's doing the majority of the other several hundred annual shootings. To try and pin this on Trump is just a political tactic.
C: (0.999%) T: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs done the wink and a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. He‚Äôs done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country.‚Äù https://t.co/mO73ikW38o via @NYTimes
C: (0.989%) T: @GhaemiPejman @lostcattears @joerogan And Elizabeth Warren was a republican for longer than he's been alive.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚Å¶‚Å¶@ewarren‚Å© is the most professorial presidential candidate. But does U.S want to be taught? Must say, it‚Äôs one of the best interviews of @ewarren and it illustrates what makes a her tick. https://t.co/RJepWWjdHF
C: (1.000%) T: @RepKarenBass Did Elizabeth Warren help pull the trigger of the Dayton shooter? Did AOC light the Molotov‚Äôs the Ice attacker threw?
C: (1.000%) T: @EmmaKennedy What does this mean Emma? May was "calm and sensible". Cameron was "calm and sensible". Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are constantly called out for being hysterical. I wouldn't say this is a particularly useful metric for choosing a politician.
C: (1.000%) T: For a College professor she certainly is not intellectually very impressive; when was the last time you saw tonsils with a HEARTBEAT? https://t.co/5Yegvcmhua
C: (0.995%) T: Post-debate polls show Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders up. https://t.co/kBVDx1sJMN
C: (1.000%) T: @OversightDems @RepCummings @PressClubDC Is subconscious communication with Elizabeth Warren and she basically said that campaign season is going on and I really didn't have the qualifications to be the president that I am still, and then later on she rescinded that. I want my job with my side of the Pentagon.
C: (0.982%) T: @RustiGal1441 Sure, the Elpaso shooter, the church murders, the church burnings,  more fucking shootings, the list is massive and you got one guy who didn't do it citing Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Forget about the @NRA, @ewarren. Can you just keep your supporters on a leash?  #daytonshooter described himself as pro-Satan '#leftist' who supported @SenWarren:  https://t.co/QqkWtoj4cE  #DaytonShooting #DaytonShooterWasALiberal https://t.co/rsZOnfyvdI

C: (1.000%) T: #FundraisingOffOfMassacres Democrats are doing this. They say they r 4 the people, But instead; they use people. For ex. Bernie &amp; Elizabeth Warren r asking 4 donations based upon the recent peoples' tragedies in Texas &amp; Ohio. There are no words 4 these kinds of discussful Dems.

C: (1.000%) T: @klawburke @ecclisiastamort @JonathanCohn this is like saying people are going to start watching the view after elizabeth warren makes an appearance

C: (1.000%) T: @ECMcLaughlin I watched Samantha B. last night &amp; they were doing interviews of random young women at a beach (didn't catch the state) who are psyched about being able to vote for the first time &amp; all of them said theyd be voting for Elizabeth Warren. 2 said they'd been helping register others
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Joins Beto O‚ÄôRourke in Calling Donald Trump a White Supremacist https://t.co/iS1ui1WM4K via @thedailybeast It's time that America recognize Trump as a White Supremisist. He's demonstrated it in his speech and his actions.
C: (1.000%) T: With Elizabeth Warren running the internet, instead of the information superhighway, it‚Äôll be more like a trail of tears
