C: (1.000%) T: @KAGRevolution @ewarren In the 90s Elizabeth Warren you were working for huge corporations including Dow Chemical who poisoned millions of women with their breast implants. You were working against the victims and for the company that caused all this pain. Your goal was give the least compensation
C: (0.980%) T: @RagingGayCons Harvard paid Elizabeth Warren $400K. They are obviously a scam.

C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow #Trump doesn't do nearly as good a job pretending to tell the truth as #ElizabethWarren but you're right; she supported #CharterSchools over unions only pretending to oppose them when faced with massive opposition! https://t.co/M0kyt8qmrd https://t.co/VMPepx5iuS

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren tell the people the truth. 26000 of the 40000 were suicides.  i get it, don't want to tackle the structural violence at the heart of all of this, that'd put power brokers out of business.  Warren Wants to Combat Gun Violence With Massive Tax Hike https://t.co/1gQuShAcDq
C: (0.993%) T: @ringlikefire He absolutely honeymooned in Russia. He and his cult absolutely shared and helped the disinformation campaign against Hillary. They absolutely are starting the same again Elizabeth Warren. They will help trump AGAIN.
C: (1.000%) T: @somuchweirdness @charles_gaba @DrDooleyMD I guess they want more ppl willing to be nasty to Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: The reason you don't invite @RichLowry of @NRO to speak at National¬†Conservatism conference is that three weeks later he runs @GeorgeWill columns attacking your conference. https://t.co/NfhGSHm4Xu

C: (1.000%) T: @EmmaVigeland Emma,  How is that deep dive on Elizabeth Warren's love of bombing hospitals and renewed support for the coup in Venezuela going?  I figure that's going to come out any day now. Have total faith in you
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Stop acting ‚Äúpoor‚Äù Elizabeth Warren. You have been in politcs too long to possibly be poor. Before that you cheated your way into handouts to pay for your education &amp; likewise for landing a job in higher education. You certainly earned your nickname Pocahontas.And you‚Äôre wealthy.
C: (0.656%) T: I mean, it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs singin‚Äô it, Elizabeth Warren is MY LADY!!! #Warren2020 https://t.co/ZfOfe2Tf3U
C: (1.000%) T: @JacksonLeeTX18 Divide the nation that's laughable that's all the left does every day. Look at Elizabeth Warren saying Michael brown was murdered. When the Obama justice department found it justified.
C: (0.986%) T: @repjohnlewis So...what happened in Ohio can clearly be laid a Elizabeth Warren's feet? You. Are. An. Idiot.
C: (1.000%) T: @gigglesreynolds @TimRunsHisMouth I agree he should be there. Good thing he's going. I wonder if Elizabeth Warren, the politician that the shooter supported and one capable of passing legislation to help stop these atrocities, will also be there to hear. I wonder if they'll even protest her and ANTIFA.ü§î
C: (1.000%) T: @mitchellvii And his personality was drawn to Elizabeth warren for some reason.
