C: (1.000%) T: @KatiePavlich Elizabeth Warren, you are so out of touch with reality. So you actually think by raising taxes on gun manufacturer's is going to stop killings? People who want to shoot others will find guns. Either from a dark alley or theft. Socialistic views won't do.
C: (1.000%) T: @kpnationalist19 @DRH1959 Is that lady Elizabeth Warren’s sister
C: (1.000%) T: @ahvance @HaygoodLaw right?? how can we make this a reality. I bet Elizabeth Warren has a plan for it

C: (1.000%) T: @DitzMcGeee Elizabeth Warren has her ex-husbands last name and she’s remarried. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  (see her Wikipedia page)
C: (1.000%) T: @JasonOverstreet @ewarren I will be so happy, so immensely relieved, and at last able to breathe and sleep again without nightmares, once Elizabeth Warren is my president. 2020 can't get here fast enough!
C: (0.783%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren do you nra because the taught the former slaves the gop freed how to use rifle. To protect against the KKK racist Democrats  .

C: (0.983%) T: Only the MSM can ask Warren &amp; Harris why they lied about Brown, but if both of them are licensed lawyers their licenses should be revoked for this.  Former Missouri Dem lawmaker, retired officer blasts Warren for tweet claiming Michael Brown was murdered https://t.co/0MSbRZIqU7
C: (0.526%) T: @JoeySalads Why do I picture Elizabeth Warren in the passenger seat, drinking an ice-cold beer???
C: (1.000%) T: @madisongesiotto No, they have to have a set number of fundraisers by some time in the very near future and it’s too late for any new entrants. So this is the field. The candidate they are rolling with against Trump is Elizabeth Warren mark my words.
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow @patfo49 I agree! Elizabeth Warren is asi pandering as are the candidates by offering voters free everything that really isn’t free, the taxpayers are paying for it.

C: (0.992%) T: “Regardless of the facts, the new media narrative will now be that an Elizabeth Warren supporter, who mostly shot men, was a sexist.” https://t.co/5GMrL5Gm7Q
C: (0.992%) T: @KamalaHarris Mmm saw your video eating that pork chop at the fair. You forget the apple sauce. You are as phony as Elizabeth Warren surprised you didnt drink a beer on camera
C: (1.000%) T: @RichardCRogers @DylanRGoldberg @AbbyLowery @BernieSanders I oppose for paying for anyone's education except for my own. Elizabeth Warren was paid $400,000 to teach ONE class at Harvard cause she was native (joke). Schools should take some responsibility for encouraging those loans &amp; not pay outrageous salaries to undeserving professors.
C: (0.716%) T: @PatGarofalo https://t.co/UfkyaJFRBd  this is not a both sides issue. If you can find one quote from Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren inciting violence I'll listen to you.
C: (0.995%) T: @repjohnlewis Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sander's must stop using their REAL violent rhetoric and radicalization groups like "Resist School," which is probably an extension of the Obama OFA group. Warren openly encourages it. Stop manipulating people Lewis. https://t.co/sTKKRR55sP
C: (0.995%) T: @julepandme @RepEscobar @realDonaldTrump @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews The Dayton shooter had far left views and had pro Elizabeth Warren posts. He also like Antifa. Are they to blame? Is Bernie Sanders to blame for the crazy man who shot up the congressional bball team? You all sound crazy. Also, Trump was too busy because she is an annoying
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is a grifter.  She says enough to get folks to buy her shit.

C: (1.000%) T: @AndrewPollackFL They trying to link the shooter to Trump but the Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth  Warren supporter so should we blame her  too? It's all about keeping this country divided so they can continue the show so we cannot find out what they really doing....
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 @AugustKat8159 Elizabeth Warren needs to retire and pray God forgives her for all her lies
C: (0.993%) T: @repjohnlewis So we can all blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton then. Good to know. I'll go tweet at her now.
