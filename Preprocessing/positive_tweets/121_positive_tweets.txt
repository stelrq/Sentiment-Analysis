C: (1.000%) T: Of all the Democrats running for President, none matches Elizabeth Warren when it comes to...[any answer is acceptable]. https://t.co/3Ui9O0dNLq
C: (1.000%) T: @steinhauserNH1 @JoeBiden @CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @foxnewspolitics By this logic then Elizabeth Warren is responsible for the Dayton Ohio shooting why is there no mention of that?
C: (1.000%) T: @StableGeniusRN @jdbrinkm1978 @Black_Chasm @ericswalwell "The mainstream media dances around the fact the Dayton shooter had many 'leftist' ideals and was an avowed supporter of Elizabeth Warren, therefore there's no motive".

C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner What do you have to say about the avid  follower of AOC and Elizabeth Warren that is on them !! As face
C: (0.986%) T: @_GravityFails @DennisWayne79 @Newsweek @TuckerCarlson @SenWarren @BernieSanders @AOC Worshipped? He was an extremist but it’s up to the FBI to decide motive. Terror acts are classified as such when they meet certain criteria, for example belief in a group encouraging members to kill. Elizabeth Warren isn’t spreading violent rhetoric.
C: (1.000%) T: @ShepNewsTeam what about the words from Dayton shooter you know from Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @JRubinBlogger Yeah. Biden is hitting his stride. His lane is defending the soul of America &amp; I am all in with that. Elizabeth Warren is still my pick. (I’m one of many black women who supports her.) But I finally think he can deliver if nominated. We need someone who loves our democracy.
C: (0.995%) T: @iamcardib Really, even the Elizabeth Warren supporter in Ohio ?
C: (1.000%) T: @LiamDan36816827 @nowthisnews @AOC He also shot and killed his sister, something tells me that Elizabeth Warren wasn’t the cause. Antifa, as far as I know, haven’t committed any murders either.
C: (0.811%) T: @G7Markson @mishacollins @realDonaldTrump Oh that's right Bernie Sanders,Elizabeth Warren and praised the devil and rallied with antifa.
C: (0.995%) T: Biden polled at 21%, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) trails by just four points with 17%. Both lead Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass), who claimed 14%... https://t.co/qBQw4C3Y4o
C: (0.996%) T: @CalebJHull @simplyorganicT Elizabeth Warren will break the #Country if elected.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth warren was paid 400,000 dollars to teach one college class, and is now complaining about the high cost of colleges today  The hypocrisy is SICKENING

C: (1.000%) T: @NebraskaNative1 @ABCPolitics He was a leftist  A democrat  Loved to vote Elizabeth warren Supported medical for all.
C: (1.000%) T: @ImpeachTrump012 @realDonaldTrump Getting mixed up now.  Was he the Elizabeth Warren supporter? Or was that the other one?  Oh, here we are....The registered Dem that they tried (a little too late) to change his profile. https://t.co/icuFp7oqdi
C: (1.000%) T: Democrats are so evil. Trump is no more responsible for the nut in San Antonio than Elizabeth Warren is for the nut in Dayton Ohio. It is completely irresponsible to make this connection.  https://t.co/erk508TqNH
C: (0.999%) T: @BrianHegseth @atrupar Find a clip of warren using racist extremist language?? The Dayton shooter had a rape list.  Find me a quote from Elizabeth Warren encouraging white men to keep a rape list.  Your logic is that of a toddler you racist moron
C: (1.000%) T: @acnewsitics Funny, then by that logic we must have Elizabeth warren responsible for this https://t.co/AEcJtNaIK4
C: (1.000%) T: King &amp; Spalding @kslaw partner Tom Spulak discussed with @businessinsider how Elizabeth Warren's attack on private equity could have a surprising group of backers: private equity investors. https://t.co/SlrIlU6u17
C: (0.998%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx It is NOT routinely published, just like the left intimidation tactics. And what you can't achieve, your whacked out followers take care of 1. El Paso another Bernie bro 2. Dayton a Elizabeth Warren supporter who was an Antifa member. So do carry on!
C: (1.000%) T: @barracudalover @RyanAFournier @JoeNBC By your logic, Elizabeth Warren caused the Ohio shooting. People are responsible for their own actions. You can't lay them on someone because you don't agree with their politics.
