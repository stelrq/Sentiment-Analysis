C: (1.000%) T: For the record, I have contributed to: Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O‚ÄôRourke, Tom Steyer, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama. Among others. And you can publish that anywhere you like.
C: (1.000%) T: @jhawk6229 @Noble_Avocado So, I actually recommended one of his financial books, and I also said that if you can't stomach his attitude, Elizabeth Warren's financial planning book is also a great option. I did not tag him. He then quoted my tweet and said
C: (1.000%) T: @USMCLiberal @realDonaldTrump The shooter was a liberal Elizabeth Warren supporter who worshipped Satan. You sure you wanna keep digging?
C: (1.000%) T: @SDSunchaser By your own stupid logic, aren't Elizabeth Warren &amp; Rachel Maddow responsible for the Dayton Ohio shooter then?  I'd love to hear you explain your hypocrisy.
C: (0.991%) T: @BetoORourke it's time for you and your cohorts to quit making money off the victims of these crimes, quit blaming the president for the El Paso ordeal, start blaming Elizabeth Warren for the shootings in Dayton and for you to SHUT YOUR BIG ASS MOUTH! YOU WILL BE PRESIDENT!
C: (1.000%) T: @jackson93733592 @pvpatty @DwbBill @washingtonpost @Sulliview @FoxNews Also can I please just reiterate that one of the shooters  Loved Elizabeth Warren had connections to Antifa and hated Republicans and Fox news. Who radicalized him?
C: (0.995%) T: @rlevinson28 @oldbridgelawyer If that's true then Elizabeth Warren pulled the trigger in Dayton Ohio. Bernie pulled the trigger on Steve Scalis.
C: (0.724%) T: @ToddMar52305076 @ewarren Kamala Harris would be good. Elizabeth Warren would destroy tech and tech is what drives our overall economy. Vote Kamala Harris over Warren. Destroying the symbiosis of the current tech industry would kill the great tech advances we see. Deep learning helps detect cancer.
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol Wow. In what way would Elizabeth Warren NOT be a good president? She is smart, fearless, respects others, knows how to work with others. Understands the world. You don't have to agree with every aspect of her plans but seriously, your standing went down several notches with that
C: (1.000%) T: @AlecFPrice I‚Äôll support whoever gets the democratic billing, but Elizabeth Warren has spoken about issues with white supremacy and financial inequalities to the point where I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs her that I get to vote for, but we‚Äôll see! Early days yet.  Till then... https://t.co/likfTiH26q

C: (0.928%) T: @BillKristol They deserve jail time my dude. We, hard working Americans, who have to scrape by everyday, we deserve Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: I really have no interest in hearing lectures about how Trump gives succor to white supremacists from people who less than a fortnight ago were rushing to the barricades to defend Al Sharpton's honor. https://t.co/y8I8SL4fKV
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is surging. This one big question looms over¬†her. https://t.co/ghpqWHBU5C https://t.co/Nq2phUNdyl
C: (1.000%) T: @LoquilloHn @DineshDSouza Elizabeth Warren already figured this one out, why do you think she decided to be Native American on applications?
C: (1.000%) T: @alfieinrealtime I‚Äôm not making light of the situation. It‚Äôs a free country, support who you want. I don‚Äôt have the answer on how to stop it, nor do you. Many of the shooters are Trump supporters, it‚Äôs not totally one sided though. The Dayton shooter last week was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: A new national poll on the Democratic presidential primary race suggests it could soon start to feel like a two-way contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/FPpUWWDWI2 by @aduehren

C: (1.000%) T: @thehill Elizabeth Warren you told people that you are First Nations and used this LIE for your own personal gain. The HILL gives you a pass on this? You should never have been allowed to run for President and charged with FRAUD. You are not one of my fellow First Nations people!
