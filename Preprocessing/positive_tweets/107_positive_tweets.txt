C: (1.000%) T: @FES_GB @ChrisPeristeri @ips_journal Seems a bit strange to highlight Bernie Sanders since progressive politics is being represented by both him and Elizabeth Warren.  Together they show that progressive ideas still hold a lot of sway in the democratic electorate

C: (1.000%) T: @TomSteyer What about Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed “pro-Satan” views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren? You calling out Warren to resign as well?
C: (1.000%) T: @RadioFreeTom How are these defenses supposed to work? So since Elizabeth Warren, a very liberal Democrat, is doing it, it's okay to support Trump doing it? Leaving aside questions of degree, and accepting the argument face value.
C: (1.000%) T: @CBSNews We are in deep trouble. The fake news is discrediting Biden as not mentally capable. Bernie is outing himself by being too radical.  Elizabeth Warren is too white.  The brainwashing of America is on track to make Kamala the Democratic choice.

C: (1.000%) T: @Millgrist1 @Roshan_Rinaldi Sweet. You just won "Dumbest Tweet of the Day". You should be proud to be in the company of such high profile persons like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.549%) T: @SpeakerPelosi One week ago America watched in horror as an Elizabeth Warren avid supporter fatality gunned down dozens of ppl killing 9.  You don't seem too concerned with that &amp; it occurred this month.  Can you say democRAT selective outrage?

C: (1.000%) T: Six. Elizabeth Warren is sharper and younger.   Granted her plans only make sense because she has stolen them from Kamala Harris, but at least she knows what day it is.
C: (1.000%) T: This @WSJopinion piece highlights one of the reasons why forgiving all #HigherEd debt is a bad idea (the impact on people who sacrificed more expensive colleges out of practicality and now pay the price) https://t.co/weMWF9EszZ

C: (0.994%) T: @RyanMalcolm111 @lacy_remington @OfficialSPGB @charliekirk11 Well one was a fan of Elizabeth Warren another bernie supporter etc
C: (1.000%) T: Do you also believe that Senators Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren &amp; Rep.AOC have "blood on their hands" because the Dayton mass murderer was a registered Democrats &amp; admirer of their politics and killed in the name of saving the environment? https://t.co/VJnpn2t3Az
C: (0.995%) T: @brandondarby Maybe Elizabeth Warren could help him.
