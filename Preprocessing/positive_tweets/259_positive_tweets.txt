C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren pays homage to a man who robbed a liquor store, wrestled a cop for his service revolver, was killed by same cop as Brown charged toward him in another attempt to disarm &amp; kill the officer.

C: (1.000%) T: Apropos of nothing...  1. Elizabeth Warren didn't actuality write or perhaps even green light this tweet, correct?
