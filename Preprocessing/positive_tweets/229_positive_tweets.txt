C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‘murdered by a white police officer’ https://t.co/z6cIrJjfNm via @twitchyteam
C: (0.974%) T: @mpvine @thehill Um no wrong, the Dayton shooter identified as a leftist who supported Bernie and Elizabeth Warren. Nice try though, attempting to divide us even more.
C: (1.000%) T: I’m gonna need and hope for Elizabeth Warren to be president
C: (0.795%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren had a chance in hell to be president. I said no.
C: (1.000%) T: The 2020 Dem candidates might be too afraid to say just how far they’re willing to go to support late-term abortions, but they’re willing to accept money from our nation’s top abortion advocates. https://t.co/bltKOMpuo7
C: (0.995%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren must be he only person left in America who thinks the Michael Brown case was "murder" and caused by "racism"  I hope Darren Wilson sues you
C: (1.000%) T: 2020 Democrats Call On Walmart To Stop Selling Gun.  Want to know why to support Sen. Elizabeth Warren? Read what she said to Walmart. https://t.co/gXtGigZyxk
C: (1.000%) T: I would love to make my hall theme a shrine to Elizabeth Warren but some of my residents probably won't love that
C: (1.000%) T: @lightblue2 @aggierican @MiaFarrow Yeah. I'm sure Elizabeth Warren is going to show up on your lawn someday with her glasses perched on the end of her nose, which will alert you that it's time to break open the arsenal.
C: (1.000%) T: @Lindsey_McBride @DrJasonJohnson Natives don't determine Native identity in the way whites look at it. Every time Native twitter tries to explain this, it gets dismissed as "GOP talking points" and they are told to get over it. Please at least learn how Natives view the issue.  https://t.co/KYCpgU7mbz
C: (0.988%) T: Elizabeth Warren isn't modeling her campaign on Bernie.  She's modeling it on Trump.  She throws tofu to the base, plays fast and loose with facts, and makes idiotically extravagant promises that will never be fulfilled.
C: (1.000%) T: Imma be late night texting mama Elizabeth Warren, hope she doesn't mind https://t.co/KjJcOI8tfm
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren So much truth here! Just like when Pope Francis dunked on LeBron James! Just like when a young Indian Scout named Elizabeth Warren checkmated Snoop Dogg's doppelgänger! Keep speaking truth to power, comrade Warren!!
C: (0.739%) T: You left out he said he was for Antifa and would vote for Elizabeth Warren. You only give half truths which means you give half lies. https://t.co/ReangLtSWQ
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidHayes1956 @DrJasonJohnson Yes. Natives have their own way of defining identity and it needs to be respected. We as white people keep looking at this through a white lens. This isn't just GOP talking points.  https://t.co/KYCpgU7mbz
C: (0.998%) T: @repjohnlewis What happens daily, in Chicago, the black on black murders, should we lay those at YOUR feet? The fire bombing at ICE  we lay at AOCs feet. How about Elizabeth Warren, should we lay Ohio at her feet? Who gets the knife wielding Hispanic in California? Stop this ignorance, NOW!
C: (0.995%) T: @DiamondandSilk Since Elizabeth Warren wants to be a Native American she should know it was her political party who started The Trail Of Tears
C: (1.000%) T: @Kerry2wolves @DrJasonJohnson The problem is that white Twitter won't listen to Native twitter because they always think it's "GOP talking points". Read this and learn how Natives view Native identity and why it's an issue.  https://t.co/KYCpgU7mbz
C: (0.542%) T: No more evidence needed that Elizabeth Warren is a vicious lying weasel. https://t.co/nNyZZxxXyo
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson Don't be obtuse.    How widespread is the character assassination campaign against Elizabeth Warren?    How many flat-out lies are told about her all day, every day?    How often is Warren subjected to both racist &amp; sexist smears and accused of sleeping her way to the top?
C: (1.000%) T: Not to mention the Dayton Ohio shooter is an avid follower of Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/Cm63RB96J5
C: (1.000%) T: Does @JoeNBC agree that it may be wiser to coalesce around Elizabeth Warren soon. I fear @JoeBiden should’ve run 4 years ago and may have missed his time at this point. It saddens me to say, but at the risk of re-electing Trump who cares.
C: (1.000%) T: Well Elizabeth Warren! proven fact you're liar! a white privileged liar taken advantage of the system to stuff your own pockets! took advantage of the system with your lies!! Trump deserves to be president more than you do pampered privileged liar!!! https://t.co/iKscOH7lCW
C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren you're a washed up old hag queen of nuts please do us all a favor and drop out of the race we all know you don't have a chance
C: (1.000%) T: @PuestoLoco @Cherokee44 I think ppl want the closest candidate that mimics Obama.  Yes, Obama is a great man but times have changed and we need a progressive fighter with policies and plans that’ll work for the 99% of America.  Elizabeth Warren I feel is that candidate.
