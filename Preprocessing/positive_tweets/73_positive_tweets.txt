C: (1.000%) T: @funder You're a BIG supporter of Elizabeth Warren. She HAS stated she WILL eliminate private health insurance and YOU'RE the PERFECT person  to explain how she'll accomplish that IF...... you're up to the task.
C: (1.000%) T: TIL that George Will thinks The Grapes of Wrath is a novel about the plucky Joad family being oppressed by paternalist do-gooders who wanted to exert too much government control over a beneficent free market. Come again? https://t.co/pCgxMQVRf7
C: (1.000%) T: Come on folks...Seriously?  @SenWarren is a Buffoon who acts like a Baboon! Watch how Baboons treat others!! Their own tribe or strangers, it doesn‚Äôt matter &gt; they‚Äôre the same! Well, EW is as smart as a Dirt Clod, IMHO!!  Elizabeth Warren Is Not Electable https://t.co/3kuS4XBNMy https://t.co/xbgOy8dxgX

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren you are lying!!! Don‚Äôt you ever get tired of lying to get anything. You lied about your heritage to get teaching position and now you are lying to win an election. https://t.co/14SUZa2TFs
C: (0.787%) T: @TrumpStudents @BetoORourke hahaha, what kinda stunt s this? Sort of like Elizabeth Warren drinking that beer on video...AWKWARD...
C: (1.000%) T: I named my new car Elizabeth Warren ‚Äòcause she‚Äôs awesome, really smart, and helps me get shit done. @ewarren https://t.co/Q1trR3SAzI
C: (1.000%) T: @VaughnHillyard @JaxAlemany Don‚Äôt overthink it bud, that‚Äôs the mistake. It‚Äôs not a personality contest. Vote for anyone not currently in office, anyone who isn‚Äôt a terrorist radicalizing, planet destroying fascist spoiled little rich boy who was never taught right from wrong. Elizabeth Warren will do - ty!
C: (0.995%) T: @Behind2020 Ugh.  Such douchey tactics these politicians use.  This is up there with Elizabeth Warren livestreaming her "casual" beer drinking in the kitchen and AOC of her "poor" apartment living/meal cooking. #Pandering101wethinkyouareallidiots
C: (0.736%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris‚Äôs controversial Michael Brown tweets, explained https://t.co/taoHIvlh3Z #press #feedly
C: (1.000%) T: @LIRIK As long as you understand when he loses the primary to our future president Elizabeth Warren you will vote with sanity without flinching.
C: (1.000%) T: Mom: you‚Äôre voting for Warren?   Me: yes   Mom: do you think she could take Trump?   Me: I think Elizabeth Warren could take him in both a political and wrestling ring.   ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm down for both.  #sorrynotsorry #Warren2020  @emrazz #vote
C: (1.000%) T: @Deggans @NPR They erased the fact that the Ohio shooter supported Antifa and Elizabeth Warren too...media not the brightest bunch these days
C: (0.520%) T: Elizabeth Warren plans include using tax code to deprive law-abiding citizens of 2nd Amendment rights  https://t.co/L7ybK54hm6
C: (0.577%) T: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders call for Walmart to stop selling guns, as workers protest the retail giant in the aftermath of deadly shootings in stores  https://t.co/U62XfWJSVZ https://t.co/AWNzawZ2C2
C: (1.000%) T: @washingtonpost @paulwaldman1 How many people would be calling it a "gaffe" and saying "lay off" if Elizabeth Warren said "poor kids are just as good as white kids"?
C: (1.000%) T: I stand with Elizabeth Warren. All the way. https://t.co/XM2CSEYc8j
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps Wow! I got to see Elizabeth Warren up close, a couple weeks ago. She's super cute and has flawless skin.  trumpers are so ugly..
C: (0.994%) T: @davethul @RadioFreeTom It's incorrect to brand Dem candidates as socialist. Bernie is not a Democrat, so he does not count here. A socialist believes in the government owning the means of production. All current Democratic candidates are capitalists, including Elizabeth Warren. Just for the record.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúIn conversation, these voters say they‚Äôre attracted to the ambitious policies of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), though many are undecided.‚Äù  #YoungVoters #Election2020  https://t.co/dv6rYdZtUK
C: (1.000%) T: Bro i been seen this from jump lol Elizabeth Warren is my girl!! https://t.co/IeqJT0Lsmj
C: (1.000%) T: @jeanieresists @Teach5691 Who are "BOTH" in this statement? Because the Article is about the way that Tucker Carlson,  and others are twisting Elizabeth Warren's words of populism to make it sound like they agree with her, which they don't.
C: (1.000%) T: @iknownothingok @ResisterSiano I just think some of the others may be more electable. Elizabeth Warren would be my first choice but any one of the Dems who are running would be an improvement. Except Williamson.
C: (0.701%) T: @AdamSerwer Elizabeth Warren:  I have a plan for all police to ride Segways in shorts.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepAlGreen The elpaso killer was NOT a white nationalist.  His background was CHANGED.  He was leftist! Why don't you mention the OTHER shooting, an ANTIFA leftists &amp; SATANIST who LOVED bernie &amp; Elizabeth Warren?!  Communist tactics to get guns!  https://t.co/qCsNGJM1W5
