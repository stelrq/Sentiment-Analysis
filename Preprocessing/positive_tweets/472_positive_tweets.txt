C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I don't know why I keep getting these tweets...I don't want to grab a beer with Elizabeth Warren, who wants to spend time with a stereotypical drunken Indian?
C: (1.000%) T: @MarkDice The president is as much a white supremacist as Elizabeth Warren is Indian. That would make it a big NO!
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson You know who didn't ask for this screed  that ends up being super divisive?  Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @gregpmiller @EvittsGwenn Just looking for your tweet about the shooter who echoed support for  Elizabeth warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Quote of the night: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can‚Äôt do and shouldn‚Äôt fight for.‚Äù - Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson So why did Elizabeth Warren's husband Bruce pretend to be Cherokee at the exact same time?  Is it just a coincidence that they both changed their identities to the same thing at the same time?
C: (0.535%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is the worst kind of racist. Pandering to the black community by pushing a DOJ proven lie, and assuming blacks will vote for her because of it. Disgusting!
C: (0.986%) T: @DineshDSouza Elizabeth Warren only stopped because she thought they were selling BEER. #Lush #Resist #Resistance #BlueWave #Indivisible #TheResistanceIsUnited #FBRParty #FBR #TrumpForPrison #TrumpMustGo #TheMarySue #UniteBlue #Progressive #VoteBlue #TrumpResign #ResignTrump #CrookedTrump
C: (0.999%) T: @seattlepi Elizabeth Warren should halt her campaign. Now let‚Äôs see whose ‚Äòshould‚Äô happens first. That one will be ‚Äòon the wrong side of history.‚Äô
C: (1.000%) T: @LisaTalmadge @Herb4Warren @HelenBrosnan At least Elizabeth Warren doesn't have a history (like Tulsi Gabbard) of advocating for conversion therapy &amp; outlawing civil unions.

C: (1.000%) T: Hillary: "Pocahontas wanted to use one of my political cards.. she doesn't know the #VaginaCard I gave her was expired"  Elizabeth Warren: "What Happened?"  #Trump2020LandslideVictory https://t.co/YYtpmiZixa
C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 Yeah he was a Elizabeth Warren junkie! Democrat! Thanks to the rhetoric the left are constantly spewing like you just did is the new America. Y'all should of just let him be president for four years then took your asses out to vote!
C: (0.994%) T: @Thomas1774Paine Take example from Rachel Dolezol, or even Elizabeth Warren for goodness sake.
C: (0.995%) T: @JordanChariton @ewarren She has always been soft on M4A! Nobody remembers her shitty ACA 2.0 plan! https://t.co/RQKePWd6Y3
C: (0.768%) T: @prestoncmoore yep. Im going for Andrew Yang, but Elizabeth Warren, Beto and, hell, Marianne Williamson would be decent candidates at this point!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren i first read this as "5 years ago, a white police officer was murdered in Ferguson, Missouri." I looked up and saw Elizabeth Warren as handle.....looked down, text changed. lol Why did i think anything good/positive could come out of her mouth??
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I get asked all the time, "Is Elizabeth Warren Cherokee?"  Well, you know the answer to that. "No, she just claimed to be while going to college, taking exams and applying for jobs."
C: (0.991%) T: Someone asked me today if Elizabeth Warren is a moron. I said yes. https://t.co/c9GoNknhvg
C: (0.954%) T: @marnes Yep. But I am learning only just how bad a person Elizabeth Warren herself is (although I already knew it anyway).
C: (0.566%) T: @wsoxfan1214 @marcorubio @POTUS Is an active Antifa member and Elizabeth Warren supporter shooting up Dayton, Ohio the fault of Elizabeth Warren? You can‚Äôt have it both ways.   I‚Äôm not concern trolling. Have a legitimate discussion where you don‚Äôt assume my motives or get out of my mentions.
C: (0.987%) T: @CYahmo @idreamofanarchy @SlytherinSansa @nikoCSFB @McscNetwork Well Warren has done even worse than that and came out with her own ACA 2.0 plan but nobody ever calls her out in it ü§® https://t.co/RQKePWd6Y3
