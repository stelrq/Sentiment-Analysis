C: (0.955%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The El Paso shooter was triggered by the Dem debate and funding healthcare for illegal immigrants.  The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan and a radical Antifa dude.  How is Trump responsible again?
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Weird, if the Dayton shooter had listened to Elizabeth Warren, he’d have  been out supporting gun laws and writing manifestos about loan forgiveness. The El Paso shooter listened to your racist rhetoric and took your dog whistle as a how-to.
C: (0.995%) T: That’s because she is a phony just like Elizabeth Warren. Americans see her for what she really is, she’s fooling nobody. https://t.co/JJ2VndvaX6

C: (1.000%) T: Eric here thinks we should believe him since he works for @CNN the most reliable liberal biased org of them all. Did you go to Dayton &amp; inform yourself about the killers approval of Elizabeth Warren &amp; antifa? Did you report on Obama’s tenure of shootings? No-you didn’t. https://t.co/awKvw1OciE

These are sick people, these are people that are really mentally ill."  -President @realDonaldTrump being a LEADER on his way to El Paso &amp; Dayton bringing CLARITY America NEEDS https://t.co/Kr0heUCgTg
C: (1.000%) T: This is exactly why I've been with Elizabeth Warren from the beginning. Gone is the day that the Dems' political strategy is based on polls.  We need to educate/persuade (not defer) people in order to lead. https://t.co/Zdn8kQEIyy
C: (1.000%) T: The only question I have after reading Rebecca Traister's marvelous piece on Elizabeth Warren the teacher, is...who is the obvious time-traveler checking their phone in the second row ?! https://t.co/uhBalYutxd
C: (1.000%) T: "It doesn’t matter that the #Daytonshooter had social media posts liked Antifa, was "radically" concerned about "global warming," &amp; supported Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren... Don’t bother me w/facts, it’s the agenda that counts.” ~ from the article. https://t.co/3cnN2os7IH

C: (0.983%) T: @robreiner How come you aren't talking about Ohio? Because he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and Antifa lover?
C: (1.000%) T: @theClaudiaInez @JoeBiden The Dayton, Ohio mass killer, Connor Betts, was a radical Democrat socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren.  He wrote: “I want socialism, and i’ll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding.”
C: (0.985%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Your advice should be directed at Elizabeth Warren not Donald Trump

C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Actually @iamcardib you are wrong.  The Dayton shooter is a left wing Elizabeth Warren supporter.  You really should know the truth before you spread a false narrative.  So I assume you will now condemn Ms. Warren right?
C: (1.000%) T: Why would anyone care if their name was attached to a donor's list that's circulating unless they donated to an awful human being? Politicians whose campaigns I've donated to over the years: John Kerry, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke.
C: (1.000%) T: @pchepul @SenatorHershey @HuddleJim That's true, but I'm sure there are some racists who support Elizabeth Warren. Assuming otherwise use just making the opposite mistakes to the one you're trying to avoid.
C: (0.686%) T: @sairasameerarao The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and hated Trump. Do us all a favor and Stuff A Sock in your mouth!
C: (0.998%) T: @BMadiuk @IlhanMN Your talking about the guy in Dayton also right? Oops he is not a white nationalist just a Bernie, Elizabeth Warren Antifa follower.
C: (0.977%) T: @Fab2Dye4 @_SJPeace_ What? I picked apart nothing. They guy put up incorrect information. Getting killed isn't better than being handcuffed and walked down the street by two police. The Ohio shooter has not been shown to be a racist. FYI, he was a fan of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: "Good teaching is about...the teacher having the confidence in you to know that if you had a little bit more information, a little bit more time, if you thought about this from a little different perspective, you might move a little bit.” https://t.co/rJk0G9ZVRH
C: (0.993%) T: i love elizabeth warren. i love you. @ewarren
C: (1.000%) T: @mj_lee @mkraju @KristenOrthman Dayton shooter loved Elizabeth Warren. Big fan.
