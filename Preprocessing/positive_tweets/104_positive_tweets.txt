C: (1.000%) T: Happy birthday to my secret wife @jesssmyerss !! I hope this post and Elizabeth Warren satisfies all of your needs today!:-) https://t.co/AIm0NMLsjb
C: (0.717%) T: @ProudResister Apparently you are forgetting the Bernie Sanders supporter that shot up Republicans at a baseball game or the recent Ohio shooter being an Elizabeth Warren so shut the F..K up you AssHole.
C: (1.000%) T: @larrydaliberal No he’s there (Dayton) to campaign for Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. And then off to El Paso to offer support to Beto.  He’s reaching out trying to help.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is only coming out with “plans” now that she is running for president . Come on you can’t really be this stupid to not realize what exactly is going on here ?
C: (0.998%) T: Has Elizabeth Warren’s message been,” People in bars are a threat to the country and we need to get rid of them?” Because, if it was, you’d have a point. But it wasn’t, so you don’t, you Great Orange Clot. https://t.co/5EJ4HrYBJs
C: (1.000%) T: “Elizabeth Warren just has a gigantic campaign. There are counties all over rural areas where some campaigns are just doing tours, but she has staff there. And that was a strategy President Obama had in 2008 when he won Nevada.”   Live, love, Region 5 #NVertheless

C: (1.000%) T: @IngrahamAngle @CNN @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump And who actually listens to Bernie and CNN. Using his logic he and Elizabeth Warren are racist for Bernie’s comments about Baltimore being s 3rd world country and Warren for the support the Dayton Ohio shooter gave her. When will this stupidity end??
C: (1.000%) T: LISTEN UP FOLKS!!. The Ohio shooter (Connor Betts) is a REGISTERED DEMOCRAT! His bestfriend said that he was “definitely not a right-leaning person. His political views definitely leaned to the left.” Betts also is a self-described "...leftist Elizabeth Warren supporter."
C: (1.000%) T: “The police bear down harder”........Oh, no, you’re not going to like a President who doesn’t support the police. Is her plan to reimagine safety by a “Beyond Policing” ideology? Let me call BS on Elizabeth Warren ASAP. https://t.co/kK12ZItWIR
C: (0.986%) T: The commie enemy domestic?  https://t.co/T7DKrI7JmZ
C: (1.000%) T: @ladydashby @415holgate Ah, but you'll need to find another example. Just because he expressed support for Elizabeth Warren doesn't mean she inspired him. She hasn't said words or repeated phrases that were quoted or used as motivation.  So I would dismiss that sort of comment about my support of her.

C: (0.995%) T: @SavedYouAClickV Elizabeth Warren reminds me of Mr. Mime, because she is a clown
C: (0.997%) T: @TulsiGabbard Elizabeth Warren is begging for something like your Harris-style takedown. Here’s one foothold: https://t.co/Gwp8NwhQTS
C: (0.994%) T: Kai Anderson is voting for Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 election I just know it https://t.co/xZBcff25ZB
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Hey Mark, there’s a lot of people who know Elizabeth Warren and not one of them would call her a pathological liar, not one.   But go ahead and do your grunt work for Donald Trump, things aren’t looking to good for him, maybe your attack on Elizabeth will lift his spirits.
C: (0.977%) T: Opinion | ‘National conservative’ policies are full of oxymorons https://t.co/34bXpJBYAr
C: (0.820%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren is a thrice married con artist who couldn't even make owning casinos profitable and who has raped numerous women and who is a racist and has ridiculous hair and wears ill fitting suits.
C: (0.989%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr Are u serious Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr How fucking old are you junior cheeto?  Elizabeth Warren is as intelligent as she is compassionate, two words that would never be used to describe you, or any member of the #TrumpCrimeFamily.   How is it your not behind bars yet, eh #TraitorTot? Tick tock MF tick tock. https://t.co/zCnOWNonmn
