C: (1.000%) T: @RepEscobar Have you listened to Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O‚ÄôRourke, Corey Booker, Kampala Harris, Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrats and msm, spewing claims of racism and everything under the sun against our president?! He has a right to defend himself!
C: (0.990%) T: Media Ignores How Dayton Shooter Was Liberal Who Supported Pro-Abortion Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders | https://t.co/M6597rhvrm. So we‚Äôve noticed! https://t.co/o3vVXMTuX5
C: (1.000%) T: @DaytimeDan @blankslate2017 @timjacobwise Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have a lot more problems than ideology, though.  The main two are their inability to galvanize African-Americans and inability to recognize that this election is about Trump ‚Äî not them and their grand plans/outlooks and policy isn‚Äôt character.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump So lets talk facts, the El Paso shooter hates Donald Trump and was inspired by the Democrat Debate to commit his crimes. The Dayton shooter is a staunch supporter of Elizabeth Warren and is also anti-Trump. But we are to believe @realDonaldTrump is responsible?
C: (1.000%) T: @MacStega @krassenstein45 @RashidaTlaib @jimkelly522 Cite me one instance where Elizabeth Warren incited violence like Trump does w/his tweets and Hitler-like rallies.. ONE! And Antifa means "anti-fascist." There is no "membership." I guess this means you're Pro-fascist?
C: (0.992%) T: All you did was try to politicize a tragedy! It amazes me none of the reporters asked either of you to comment on the Dayton shooter being for Elizabeth Warren &amp; Antifa. It's now being reported El Paso shooter blamed what he did on democrats call for free healthcare for illegals https://t.co/rb3i6KGHd4
C: (1.000%) T: @JFNYC1 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èTrump's words have encouraged violence you dont see Elizabeth Warren doing that
C: (1.000%) T: @kelly2277 @realDonaldTrump @Twitter Is that Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren behind bars?  It doesn't matter to the Trump Brigade.  They need them their enemy.
C: (0.987%) T: @NYCMensch @4Tiglion The Dayton gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/V0lyJn0qhX
C: (0.999%) T: @DaveBow62310286 @colvinj @RobElgasABC7 Ahhh so we care about some and others we explain away. So whose rhetoric caused the Dayton shooting? He was a satanist Antifa wannabe who was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren. I guess you have to push narrative somehow n mentioning Chicago violence or Dayton shooter hurts that üòè
C: (0.986%) T: This Moron, Satan Worshipping, Socialist, Elizabeth Warren supporter, thought he was Boba Fett the Mandolorian Bounty Hunter. https://t.co/fWoVTVHa2e
C: (0.986%) T: @jackresists I‚Äôd almost guarantee, Elizabeth Warren has got a plan for that.
C: (0.987%) T: @allenpayne_1 @davidwebbshow @CoryBooker Just found out the Dayton shooter was an Antifa supporter and supported Elizabeth Warren he also supported Bernie Sanders.
C: (1.000%) T: @gtconway3d I‚Äôm proud to financially support Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄòWarren has built a monster‚Äô: Inside the Democrats‚Äô battle for Nevada - POLITICO. ***Ok Patriots, grass roots effort for ‚Å¶@POTUS‚Å© in small areas! Let‚Äôs not get blindsided by Pocahontas! https://t.co/4JrSgD3nnf
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN So what, no rational person thinks that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren encouraged the Dayton shooter even if he did share some of their politics.  We can't say that about you and the El Paso shooter.
C: (0.991%) T: @pvpatty @jackson93733592 @washingtonpost @Sulliview @FoxNews If that is true, then the left is responsible for Daytona.  He was a Elizabeth Warren supporter, had connections to antifa and he absolutely hated Republicans and Fox News. #TrueStory
C: (0.999%) T: @BridgetKF30 @DNC @georgesoros @POTUS Every mass murder shooter has been a Democrat, a leftist or a Muslim.  The Dayton shooter was inspired by the hateful rhetoric of Elizabeth Warren and the El Paso shooter was influenced by his belief in climate change and the Democratic debate.  George soros hand is in everything
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris up the 2020 Dem pandering ante by remembering day Michael Brown was ‚Äòmurdered by a white police officer‚Äô https://t.co/Y34xKdOY08
C: (0.994%) T: Today I was asked if I was white, I said no I‚Äôm Native American-Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/YqmI0iMkve
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren elizabeth warren claims she is a native american.. i think everything else she says needs to be purviewed given her proclamation
C: (1.000%) T: @theonegoodsam Your truth is 2 strong just like Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: I guess some people really know how to teach property! #teachinggoals   "Warren proposed to Mann in a classroom after watching him teach a class in property law."  https://t.co/AfDuo5t92D
C: (1.000%) T: @HannahRose2046 @CastorLocke @FoxNews @RaymondArroyo As I'm sure you know I do not like Donald Trump. And he's a big Trump guy of course. He's said some crazy things in his past I don't like, and he agrees with Elizabeth Warren on economics soooooooo yeah lol üòÇ
C: (0.505%) T: Elizabeth Warren, one of their phony polls in the military- only 238 convictions.
