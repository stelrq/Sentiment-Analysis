C: (1.000%) T: @USATODAY @realDonaldTrump  One more time mr. President. The shooting in Dayton had nothing to do with politics. His girlfriend said so. Not about Elizabeth Warren. About Bernie Sanders not even about you as much as you'd like to believe. He was mentally ill. In El Paso it was different..
C: (1.000%) T: @kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate that I heard who is coming to the table with a plan AND the policies to back it up. Can we pls focus on that!

C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC @Dee16916262 I’m a proud supporter of former VP Biden, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are closing fast. ( in my opinion) I will #VoteBlue2020 no matter who is the nominee. The Republican Taliban party are dangerous people who HAVE to be voted out.

C: (1.000%) T: I'm marginally impressed that Trump just denied he "blames" Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooting, given how prominent that narrative has been on right because, supposedly, the Dayton shooter was a "leftist." Kellyanne Conway was pushing the narrative yesterday.
C: (0.983%) T: Is there a cause-and-effect between Trump's speeches and the El Paso Massacre?  Is there a similar effect between Elizabeth Warren speeches and the Ohio massacre?   How about between Obama's speeches and the Sandy Hook killings? https://t.co/3Y0ZcWjIEm
C: (1.000%) T: Trump; “I would like to stay out of the political fray but the Dayton shooter was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren"  He said this in his usual driveway gaggle as well as in tweets.  He’s a horrible human cc: @nytimes
C: (0.721%) T: @robreiner You seem to have forgotten about the Dayton OH shooting. The shooter was a far left supporter of Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA.
C: (1.000%) T: This MOTHERFUCKER just called out the Dayton shooter as a fan of Antifa, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.   He slickly and purposely skipped right over the El Paso shooter who is HIS “fan”.
C: (1.000%) T: @SawyerHackett @JoeNBC What about the shooter who idolized Elizabeth Warren?  Did you talk about him?
C: (0.591%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Elizabeth Warren isn't promoting hate like Donald Trump.
C: (1.000%) T: @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Sorry this president has already started minimizing this terrorists bc the Daytona, Ohio one manifesto talked about ANTIFA Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. He will spin this in his favor mark my words
C: (1.000%) T: A new national poll on the Democratic presidential primary race suggests it could soon start to feel like a two-way contest between former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/I2uDkF6iDK by @aduehren
C: (0.994%) T: @TeamCalvert Stop lying Kenny. Elizabeth Warren's entire platform is dedicated to saving capitalism and enforcing the rule of law. #GOPCrimeSyndicate
C: (0.997%) T: .@POTUS at WH just now, prior to leaving for El Paso/Dayton: "My critics are political people, they're trying to score points. If you look at Dayton, that person who supported Bernie Sanders... antifa.... Elizabeth Warren -- had nothing to do with President Trump."

C: (1.000%) T: @GeorgeConk I do think there is a lot to learn about her background as a scholar and teacher  This article, which discusses her background as a law and economics scholar seemed a bit unfair -- not unlike cheap shots at Biden, et  al. 1/  https://t.co/0kHrh4lnRD
C: (0.987%) T: @SenGillibrand THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED! Still awaiting Elizabeth Warren to apologize for the Dayton shooter, who was a supporter of hers.
C: (0.999%) T: A hobo pilfers your wallet in public and it’s called thievery.  If Elizabeth Warren does it it’s called progressive. Can you imagine a worse dilemma; Trump or Warren?
