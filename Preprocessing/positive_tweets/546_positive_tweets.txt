C: (1.000%) T: Just a light $85 billion. I need to see what the total of Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs proposals have amounted to https://t.co/1tWCSdljyn
C: (1.000%) T: Yes, that‚Äôs because the Dayton shooter said he supported Elizabeth Warren on social media. They don‚Äôt want to talk about the Dayton victims; they can‚Äôt USE their deaths to try to get their poll numbers up! https://t.co/Y6U18irWCv

C: (1.000%) T: @CherylThaxton @TitaniaMcGrath When I was a kid I always pretended to be an American Indian (like Elizabeth Warren) does that count?
C: (1.000%) T: @ItsNotPersonal0 @JimJlr2 @chaplin8383 You do have a good point but I don't want to blame Donald Trump Elizabeth Warren or even  , Obama  , and Bernie Sanders ... even AOC because you know antifa tried to bomb a facility down at the border because of her rhetoric
C: (0.988%) T: If you are blaming Trump for the shootings while also failing to recognize the Dayton shooter loved Elizabeth Warren, you are the problem
C: (0.996%) T: @RoArquette Have about same Native American ancestry as Elizabeth Warren so I‚Äôm good.
C: (1.000%) T: Trump's attempts "set destructive partisanship aside"seem to have vanished as quickly as his marriage vows. So far today he has attacked the Mayor of Dayton Nan Whaley, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, Sherrod Brown, Joe Biden, CNN, Shepard Smith &amp; Fox News.
C: (1.000%) T: Sherrod Brown, Mayir of Dayton, Elizabeth Warren, Biden and almost all Democrats know that the Dayton Shooter was a far left Antifa Sympathizer, Climate Nut &amp; supporter of Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren. Yet they blame Trump and try to project the incident as a case of racism.
C: (1.000%) T: No one gets everything right.  As for batting average, however, if Elizabeth Warren was playing in the Major Leagues, people would be tuning in every time she came to the plate.  From her financing to refusing to go on FOX, she's being proven correct.  https://t.co/SDJsEaAd0o
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol They certainly do, the rest of us don't. However justice can be served up to them by the proper and measured application of Elizabeth Warren in the next administration. Yes, I'm looking forward to that. Atty. general perhaps?
C: (1.000%) T: @ScottFordTVGuy @realDonaldTrump @OANN Oh Scott! NO!! üòÇ I rescue sick and abused cats no one cares about. But in NO way do I support Elizabeth Warren. ‚òπÔ∏è
C: (1.000%) T: @chrislhayes @rtraister That's not all the stuff they're doing in desperation--I just saw a Twitter ad by the NRCC which screamed at people to oppose leftists (I wonder what one looks like, because, a lifelong Democratic activist, I've never seen one), accompanied by a photo of Senator Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN Newsflash, the Dayton Ohio shooter supported Antifa and Elizabeth Warren.  I am also one who will not let you get away with stating that anybody who supports the country they live in is a white nationalist as if it means we also support racism.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx the one in Dayton Ohio you're not even talking about that shooter he was Elizabeth Warren supporter the one in El Paso he said in his Manifesto that he hated the president but you didn't mention that either you took the last paragraph and used it and it was false
C: (1.000%) T: @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @StateDept Because there MUST BE AN ACCOUNTING. IT IS GOOD GOVERNANCE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE OUR MONEY IS GOING AND WHY. Does that answer your question, Elizabeth Warren?
C: (0.987%) T: News: ISPs spend $10 billion to defeat Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/k1O8srzNhZ
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren The one shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan. You hatred spread to him and see what YOU caused? Any comment on that ?

C: (1.000%) T: @txblondegrad Capture wasp, put it on a box moistened on the inside, poke a few holes in it, wrap in a gauze, FedEx box to Elizabeth Warren and imagine how angry the wasp will be when the box is opened. Would be a nice touch if the wasp were red.
C: (1.000%) T: @DeborahDitkows1 @rtraister @ewarren The excellent article by @rtraister does exactly this. Also, see @ewarren's book A Fighting Chance. https://t.co/V9kFx9mU93
C: (1.000%) T: @TylerHuckabee @tara_atrandom I mean personally I‚Äôve been a democratic socialist since 2005ish so I‚Äôm very much in the Bernie Camp but like I‚Äôll take Elizabeth Warren very happily, and will eagerly vote for any of the democrats. I‚Äôm anyone but the Cheeto Dusted Douche 2020.

C: (1.000%) T: @WajahatAli Is that how this works? Meaning Elizabeth warren is responsible for the Dayton shooting then too
