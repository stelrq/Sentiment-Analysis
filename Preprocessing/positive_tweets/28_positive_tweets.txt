C: (0.988%) T: The ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren has a plan for that‚Äù skit was kinda funny...
C: (1.000%) T: @RadioFreeTom @jonathanchait People could get rich underestimating Elizabeth Warren. She should, according to conventional wisdom, have lost badly to Scott Brown but she campaigned as she is doing now; thoughtfully, unflappably, and honestly.  Scott lost. So will Trump, in a landslide.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Your back at Stirring the Race Pot!! Not enough attention with your usual Haterd and Money Grubbing comments. Elizabeth Warren is a Liar and a Thief!! She‚Äôs stolen a education and a Career from the poorest of the poor. Scratch a Liar catch a Thief! She‚Äôs a Communist Leftist. https://t.co/uTz0299LIV
C: (1.000%) T: Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter Friday that Michael Brown was ‚Äúmurdered‚Äù by a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù policeman in Ferguson, Mo. This is an absolute whopper and obviously does nothing to calm racial tension in this country. Yet it‚Äôs gotten almost no coverage
C: (0.982%) T: @CalebJHull @lancearmstrong Lance is known as the Elizabeth Warren of the Tour De France.
C: (1.000%) T: @LizMair Elizabeth Warren is by far the most intelligent and thought out candidate that‚Äôs ever run. And I‚Äôm not even a supporter. She would chew Trump up and spit him out. She makes Hillary look like an intellectual lightweight.
C: (1.000%) T: How teaching, despite the schoolmarm digs, might be the best preparation America will comprehend for a female President https://t.co/86WhyWaqWD
C: (1.000%) T: Someone as clueless and, actually, not too bright as JR shouldn‚Äôt pick on a more than capable, intelligent woman (Elizabeth Warren) It makes him look truly stupid. https://t.co/uzqeyJcWee
C: (1.000%) T: @BuzzFeedNews Elizabeth Warren needs to tone her rhetoric down.  Michael Brown was NOT murdered by a white policeman.

C: (0.956%) T: @DemGovs Poll results as of now, to save you the trouble.  Thanks for voting! Here are the current frontrunners:   Joe Biden Pete Buttigieg Kamala Harris Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Let me be clear, I think Elizabeth Warren is the progression of the Hillary campaign.  So are Kamala and Juli√°n and Cory and... Um, maybe Mayor Pete.  This is where we need to be, nor replaying 2016, but putting the best minds to the problems of 2020 and beyond.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren got a plan for everything. Here is her plan for a great presidency... BIDEN.
C: (1.000%) T: @tucgoodman @LizMair Yes, anyone who thinks Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have interchangeable careers and positions hasn't been paying attention.  He has a much longer Senate career; hers is more substantial.  And she gets along fine with the other candidates (and other Senators.)

C: (1.000%) T: Look. Elizabeth Warren parroting the ‚ÄúMarino is a dictator‚Äù line. Further confirmation that my #NeverWarren stance is completely justified. She is a stooge for status quo US imperialism. https://t.co/TqoaJ7jF2i
C: (1.000%) T: @Jude95240899 @ChuckMastan @TomiLahren No, it is because it is the internet and connotation is ambiguous. The Dayton shooter is hands down a leftist and an Antifa member. They guy even said he was going to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  FFS where do you get your shitty info?
C: (1.000%) T: @jbillinson @brianbeutler Still hasn‚Äôt gotten the sand out of his ass Elizabeth Warren kicked up there.
C: (0.995%) T: @nlfisker @scooterdawg @SenWarren My favorite, Elizabeth Warren ? üíô
C: (0.914%) T: @DrJasonJohnson Hmm.. Maybe if the mainstream media constantly derided "Elizabeth Warren" &amp; her supporters, hit piece after hit piece, made comments about how "she makes their skin crawl" I think they also would be aggressive in defending their candidate from never-ending bad faith attacks!
C: (1.000%) T: Its obvious Elizabeth Warren hates cops so next time she needs help she can call #Deray or his BFF #ShaunKing https://t.co/PzAgA4o5bJ
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a plan, popularity shouldn't get you elected!üëä‚úå
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren introduces ambitious plan to reduce gun-deaths by 80% https://t.co/mF1oJKfloD
C: (1.000%) T: QUESTION:  Why is the lamestream media all over the El Paso shooting and completely ignoring the Dayton, OH shooting?  ANSWER:  Because the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and the El Paso shooter was a Trump supporter.  Which fits the liberal narrative?
