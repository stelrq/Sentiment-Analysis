C: (1.000%) T: If Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic nominee and you don't vote for her because she's not progressive enough, there is only one possible explanation: misogyny. Sexism was foundational to the Bernie-or-Busters in 2016 and that shit has not gone away. https://t.co/OEtBFuU042

C: (1.000%) T: @KevinMAdamiak @DidiHopes @RashidaTlaib Well the person responsible for the mass shooting in Ohio was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren. So that would make her a racist by the new #Democrats standard. Can‚Äôt have it both ways!!!
