C: (0.996%) T: @barth_vaderwitz @TimRunsHisMouth @JoaquinCastrotx That would also be for Elizabeth Warren for the shooting in Ohio then correct? For her socialist ideas?
C: (0.988%) T: @slebitz @mkraju &amp; why aren't you blaming Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders for happened in Dayton &amp; Steve Scalise?
C: (1.000%) T: let's deal with facts and not lies and opinion. there was 1 white supreme. in TX. and 2 other shooters who were radical leftist, then the OH shooter was a Satanist who was a Elizabeth Warren supporter, who was going to vote for her or Bernie. He wanted socialism. How about the https://t.co/RA4xIWzW6N

C: (0.991%) T: @DemGovs DEMs: YOUR FRIENDS. REPORT THIS!! The Dayton shooter was a huge ANTIFA supporter.  Big Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporter.  His manifesto sounded a lot like AOC - stop ICE, tear down the border fences, etc. https://t.co/QaHUSdumrw
C: (1.000%) T: @ABC Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren aren‚Äôt even presidents yet but they‚Äôve already proposed way more action about this one issue than Donald Trump has proposed in his entire term so far. President Trump, join Democrats in condemning violent crimes and supporting gun reform bills.
C: (0.985%) T: @AOC It is you and the CULT that is placing complete fear for the Hispanics and the people of this nation! You were mentioned in the docs for mass shooting. Now  Elizabeth Warren named..all fingers are pointing at you!
C: (1.000%) T: @ladydashby Here you go. You can look up all of Elizabeth Warren's donors in Kentucky. Campaigns are required by law to report this information every 3 months.  So, the answer as to who does that is THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT.  https://t.co/S7yeL8qjJk
C: (0.994%) T: @trixiemattel @ewarren @MartiGCummings "I'm Elizabeth Warren calling Donald Trump a white supremacist, Trixie Mattel!"
C: (0.999%) T: Hmmmm....1st it was in Massachusetts; a liberal hotbed.  That‚Äôs it. A very blue state where condescending adults live because they‚Äôre more ‚Äúeducated‚Äù and smarter than everyone else. They have the fake Indian Elizabeth Warren; one of the four squat squaders; joesph Kennedy; bleh https://t.co/oO3tEai9dY

C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Liar. Your profile literally says you cover Elizabeth Warren. Unbelievable.
C: (0.984%) T: @showusyourwork @yusufsaysbernie @sardonicIeftist @ewarren "I'm a capitalist to my bones." ~ Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/3wl0iBKw7w
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a White Woman. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign is not anchored in a big policy idea like Bernie Sanders‚Äô Medicare for All. He is not proposing transformative change like Elizabeth Warren. Instead, Biden‚Äôs call to voters is a more visceral one, casting the 2020 race as a test of the country‚Äôs character. https://t.co/ocLRuvla41
C: (1.000%) T: A little less talk and a lot more action?  Life has been as easy for you, Elizabeth Warren.  Pussy.  Ready for a test of your manhood?  Come do some extreme sports contests with me.  Like low-pull contest, while freefall skydiving.  I'll take her to the edge and past it.  Talker. https://t.co/RxaBKAaPN8
C: (0.996%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren would be elected President. I said there's less than 1 chance in 1024.
C: (1.000%) T: Wow... Elizabeth warren really rocks! https://t.co/LEUbWJQsuS
C: (1.000%) T: @brookssus9935 @SmuggDugg @TheRickWilson According to your logic, that means Elizabeth warren caused the shooting in Dayton, correct?
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is off her rocker. I said yes.
C: (0.985%) T: @SebGorka Elizabeth Warren you're the white supremacist teaching hate and racism anything to get yourself elected but you'll never be commander-in-chief
C: (1.000%) T: If they're coming hard for Elizabeth Warren, they're worried. This is good.   What's not good is what any number of white supremacists might do to "help fix the problem."
C: (1.000%) T: @Rhona0505 I don‚Äôt know what it would take. I watch Elizabeth Warren and listen to her and I think WHY? Why can‚Äôt we have this brilliant, strong WOMAN be our president. We‚Äôve had 45 MEN. It‚Äôs time damnit! Every single one of us came from a woman we wouldn‚Äôt be here without us!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Fanning the flames of civil war I see, Elizabeth Warren.   If that is what you want, I assure you that is what you will get.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren who the heck charges $7 for a lemonade?? and who is stupid enough to pay even more for it? oh wait ... that'd be Elizabeth Warren with other people's money
