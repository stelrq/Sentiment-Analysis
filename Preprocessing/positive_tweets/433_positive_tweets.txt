C: (0.988%) T: @donnabrazile @FoxNewsSunday @ABC Talk about the Elizabeth Warren antifa supporting guy in Ohio
C: (1.000%) T: Playing Devil’s Advocate here - if Trump is responsible for El Paso, why isn’t Elizabeth Warren responsible for Dayton ? El Paso used Trump’s words but Dayton used Elizabeth Warren’s name ? #shootings
C: (1.000%) T: This this this. This right here is why Elizabeth Warren is going to win. Every time she says her day one agenda would be passing her anti-corruption plan to get money out of politics and give the government back to the people I know I made the right choice in being @TeamWarren https://t.co/IogVzm599o
C: (1.000%) T: @ZerlinaMaxwell Actually, the discussion was about Elizabeth Warren *and* Bernie Sanders. But that may have slipped your mind. Otherwise I think you made a good point.
C: (0.994%) T: @Walksca @RVAwonk @cnnbrk That's what I thought. Elizabeth Warren isn't far left. The RWNJs posing that are idiots.
C: (0.984%) T: Elizabeth Warren has Isabelle energy
C: (1.000%) T: #Warren2020 ewarren: I loved meeting Masada and her family! Motion sickness is no fun for anyone—mom or kid. It happens to the best of us. https://t.co/qTH831QtXd
C: (0.997%) T: @Monster_Medic @HongKongHermit hahahaha. Native Alabamian. You're Muskogee like Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee?
C: (1.000%) T: @Whatapityonyou Every time I go on FB right now there has been a paid content piece in my feed from WaPo saying Elizabeth Warren is surging. Same article for 3 days. At this point it's just blatant propaganda.
C: (1.000%) T: HEY  DRUMF    look at the size of the audience in Iowa of all places and they are there for Elizabeth Warren! https://t.co/kELEEPnPHb
C: (1.000%) T: @davethul @creativelytired @RadioFreeTom All of the Democrats running right now believe in democracy  and capitalism. Not sure about capitolism, but even Elizabeth Warren believes in capitalism.  Thinking government should provide expanded services != not believing in capitalism. How can I help you understand that?
C: (1.000%) T: Just so it’s clear to everyone -- Elizabeth Warren is simply another paid/corrupt/deep state oligarch servant. They come in many forms; rest assured she is one of them. Warren endorsed disgusting Hillary in ‘16 (ewww). Also, check out her net worth.... https://t.co/3IaGLEvUOT
C: (1.000%) T: @Walksca @RVAwonk @cnnbrk Ok, but what in particular is far left? What I heard people claiming was Satanism (not a Left position), Antifa (anti-fascism, my dad fought Fascists in WWII), and supporting Elizabeth Warren, and she's not far Left at all.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoseCastilloJr @MaeveReston @JoeBiden Definitely campaign supporter for Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.  I’m surprised at how much “opinion” influenced this ‘reporter ‘ in critiquing various candidates.
C: (0.999%) T: I said it before the media did a disservice to Elizabeth Warren by constantly grouping her w/Bernie Sanders. She isn’t him but people perceive it. And I knew the hint of it would hurt her in a general election. https://t.co/uJu6b59vOD
C: (0.520%) T: Elizabeth Warren plans include using tax code to deprive law-abiding citizens of 2nd Amendment rights https://t.co/JzEOmUnK11
C: (0.985%) T: And now Elizabeth Warren has a plan to raise taxes on ammo and more!!  Good for her. @ewarren https://t.co/bwjg8AX8Ju
C: (0.977%) T: @BillBlair @liberalparty @TheDemocrats @cafreeland @JustinTrudeau Elizabeth Warren takes on NRA with sweeping new gun control plans - CNNPolitics https://t.co/rddWQjnOpz
C: (1.000%) T: Well known Consv WP columnist describes Warren's politics - current brand of National Consv. I agree &amp; being an Ind w/ Consv &amp; Librl leanings.  George Will always has something good to say! Opinion | ‘National conservative’ policies are full of oxymorons https://t.co/aX2omcdWqN
C: (1.000%) T: @jvgraz @AryanaTarg You are having a laugh aren't you? Look at the shooters they both supported left wing policies one was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren how are they right-wing?
C: (0.993%) T: @tribelaw How did it make you feel knowing the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren and Antifa, or the Bernie Supporter who who shot Steve Scalese... stop blaming Trump for a crazy kid who’s manifesto said he was a climate guy and his hate was before Trump! https://t.co/YbbCTYwoMe
C: (0.725%) T: Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren calls police murdering racists on Twitter https://t.co/wZfPR831iD via @The Peoples Ledger
C: (0.999%) T: @xital_1 @janer98 @Joe_Hildebrand Personally I like Elizabeth Warren but perhaps too far left for the average democrat. But who knows you guys managed to put an idiot in the White House already
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow I'm tired of politicians like Elizabeth Warren trying to win elections at our expense when we have to deal with the divisions they promote in our communities. We'd probably work out our differences a lot better without all their squawking.
C: (1.000%) T: @nbeaudrot There is a huge difference between Elizabeth warren’s plan and trumps empty promises.  Trump lies and misleads constantly - think of all the things he promised that he had no intention or plan to get done.  Like Mexico paying for the wall, or the “infrastructure plan” etc
