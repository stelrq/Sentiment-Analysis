C: (0.979%) T: @oldmanebro You know how many dopes are voting for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren to take another 30%-40% more out of their paycheck than what they‚Äôre currently paying for ‚Äúfree‚Äù education, healthcare, etc.?

C: (0.697%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren if you're not wanting to waste billions on give away programs you want to waste our tax dollars on a project we didn't ask for or need. But I'm not disappointed it's typical of Democrats to spend other people's money instead of using their brains for a solution.
C: (1.000%) T: please congratulate me on schoolmarm-ing myself and getting my letter done. I really hope Elizabeth Warren would be proud of me. https://t.co/n7cHXTTNoT
C: (1.000%) T: @LovedayEd @govtrack @timburchett Elizabeth Warren is brilliant and understands wall street better than most anyone. Financial markets have to be regulated as we saw what happens when they're not in 2008. Income inequality cannot continue to spiral out of control or there won't be a middle class left.
C: (0.989%) T: Elizabeth Warren will have a plan to expose, break up and dole out justice to the conspiracy between Trump, Putin,MBS, NK, Netanyahu, Poland, Venezuela, and more. #GOPTraitors #TransNationalCrimeSyndicate https://t.co/C5xgvf0izP

C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @BillKristol STOP THIS BS ELIZABETH WARREN CAMPAIGN, this early, please.  You're losing my respect and close to losing a follow, tho I'm sure you're gaining tons who've already made up their minds.  This is dangerous behaviour at a scary time in your country.
C: (0.540%) T: @Schmaniel @JMarcusCoaching @soulcycle The shooter in Dayton quoted Antifa and professed love for Elizabeth Warren. The prick who shot Scalice was a Bernie Bro. The idiot who shot recently in Colorado was a transexual.  See how that works.
C: (1.000%) T: When you see years of policy work coming to the fore with #POTUS candidates like @ewarren dropping tangible plans! Sen.

C: (1.000%) T: @Mykes2nyce @MSNBC @jacobsoboroff Also, I noticed you did not hashtag Dayton. Oh, that‚Äôs because that shooter was one of you who support Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and the Domestic Terrorist Group Antifa.

C: (1.000%) T: @raybae689 Looks like Operation "Let 'Em Talk" is working very well. Elizabeth Warren has an "identity crisis" goin' on. Fortunately, it's a diagnosis that has been studied for a long time. It's listed as "#10T" in the medical books or, ID10T I'm thinkin' she may be into stage 4

C: (1.000%) T: Yesterday I found myself face to face with my hero and had the honor of giving her a hug. I whispered in her ear "you're my hope" and Elizabeth Warren took a moment, looked into my eyes and said "and you're my hope too."
