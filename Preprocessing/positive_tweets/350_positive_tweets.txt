C: (1.000%) T: My guess is that as more voters get to see Warren in action, her numbers will continue to go up and up, and the "electability" nonsense will evaporate. Get her on a stage with Biden and she'll blow him away. Get her next to Trump and she'll destroy him. https://t.co/LtcV0BvTDY

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has stolen Kamala Harris’s idea (once again) &amp; it saddens me that the white lady will get credit for it. I know I’ll lose followers (and I don’t care), but I will never vote for Warren. I can’t wait to defeat her.

C: (0.999%) T: I despise false questions about Elizabeth Warren's "electability"-- particularly the sexist comparison to Hilary Clinton, as if two women of a similar age are identical. Donald Trump and Chuck Schumer are men of a similar age. Get off, pundits. https://t.co/LtcV0BvTDY
