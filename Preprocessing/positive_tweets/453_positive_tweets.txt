C: (1.000%) T: @flame_cj @Andiiterrapin @exjon Only in your imagination, does anything the POTUS or Tucker Carlson says, is a template for terroristic behavior.  But we do know the Dayton killer explicitly took inspiration from Elizabeth Warren, so...

C: (1.000%) T: @Melomelly2 There have been numerous campaign workers in Saints Rest lately. The largest group would be for Elizabeth Warren, but there are also organizers for Pete, Kamala, Beto, and others I can't remember at the moment. Several candidates have also visited Grinnell.

C: (1.000%) T: Trump is 73 years old, Joe Biden is 76,  Bernie Sanders is 77, Elizabeth Warren is 71.  Putin is the teenager in the group at 66, still in his prime..It appears in the US that being old in the in thing.  It's good to respect your elders. But forward looking? Not so much. 😊😊
C: (1.000%) T: @washingtonpost For those who blame Trump for El Paso must then blame Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for Dayton or your logic doesn’t hold up
C: (1.000%) T: Shortly after the El Paso shooting, Elizabeth Warren reignited her longstanding Fox feud, this time tweeting, “We need to call it out: Fox News is a hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists.” https://t.co/pyNMeLaOjz

C: (0.994%) T: @Ryn0ceros @NBCNewsTHINK @amyspitalnick Elizabeth Warren registered with the Texas bar as an "American Indian" trying to use race to her advantage over others. Absolutely despicable but not surprising since she belongs to the biggest hate group in America: The Democrat party. Here it is👇 in here own handwriting. https://t.co/9MbTl4jQwb
C: (1.000%) T: @ChiTownSam723 @LeftwardSwing See this comment makes me think you are actually just trolling. Among many other things... https://t.co/eVcPglljyZ
C: (1.000%) T: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts speaks about some of the economic reforms she would push for as president. https://t.co/zlSQArRv48
C: (0.999%) T: I was wondering what Elizabeth Warren’s children do for a living. Well her daughter works at for-profit healthcare United Healthgroup. 🤔 https://t.co/TSVYLUomSH
C: (0.913%) T: Kamala and Elizabeth Warren are like the female versions of Harry and Lloyd from Dumb and Dumber. They both regurgitate lies. Truth is,  Michael Brown was a thug and was shot because he was doing thug shit. Y'all are just pandering for the black vote again...pathetic! https://t.co/2sk6LK55zp
C: (0.998%) T: Elizabeth Warren autographs a copy of The Mueller Report with "I Read This Report" at the Iowa State Fair. More photos from the annual fair amid a flurry of visits from Democratic presidential candidates this weekend: https://t.co/VjteABBoHf 📷 @brian_photog https://t.co/6hPSUGRc2K
C: (1.000%) T: Michelle Obama/Elizabeth Warren ticket would be the strongest possible combinations the Democrats can field in 2020 IMHO. Remember you heard it here first.
C: (1.000%) T: In all seriousness, this picture of Elizabeth Warren lunging toward a corn dog took my breath away. https://t.co/lavelll88Q
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren falsely stated that President Trump was "responsible" for the El Paso and Dayton shootings -- despite the Dayton shooter being one of her supporters. https://t.co/W6cAXAM7io
C: (1.000%) T: It blows my mind that there’s people who are actually going to willingly vote for people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren because they’re promised free. @realDonaldTrump isn’t my favorite but he’s better than them by far and y’all are doing a good job of reeelecting him!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren committed fraud to get a job. I said yes.
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren was a “Liawatha” I said yes. https://t.co/mlAclBCpYr
C: (1.000%) T: A very good piece.  I appreciate it because it's about Elizabeth Warren, yes, but what strikes me most is what it says about women in politics and the pressure put on them to overcompensate for their gender by working harder.  https://t.co/art7PBy35U
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and I said yes.
