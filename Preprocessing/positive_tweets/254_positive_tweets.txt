C: (1.000%) T: @Mwparsons @AllllAbboaaardd Rwanda was a racial civil war, it wasn't a political divide.  The Democrats need to avoid trigger affects.  Waco was a trigger that caused Oklahoma city.  I personally think Kamala Harris and Elizabeth warren will cause all kinds of triggers.  It would be good.
