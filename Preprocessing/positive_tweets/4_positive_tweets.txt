C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren Today no one asked me about Elizabeth Warren because nobody cares.   #Trump2020LandslideVictory #AllAmericansFirst #MakeLiberalsCryAgain
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Do better, Elizabeth Warren. This is an awful incitement statement. Why can‚Äôt you do better?
C: (1.000%) T: @TrumpWarRoom And this is the Democrats front-runner I love it. And in second place comes in Elizabeth Warren a liar and a socialist and all the Democrats can talk about is Trump they have major problems
C: (0.959%) T: @tomwatson These are not Bernie style attack on Senator Warren. Bernie and Elizabeth Warren are great friends. I doubt your love for Senator Warren.  There is NO Bernie 2.0 https://t.co/aqTBEafuwW
C: (1.000%) T: If Elizabeth Warren can do this with lemonade, imagine what she can do with a country. https://t.co/lbvafz7AfN
C: (1.000%) T: @joewhitemusic @ninaturner @jjz1600 @washingtonpost @BernieSanders A true "progressive voice" would pay her interns, not exploit a loophole the way HRC did in 2016.   At #AFSCMEForum, again Elizabeth Warren stabbed Sanders in the back and claimed his full student debt cancellation plan exacerbates the racial wealth gap.   She needs to drop out.
C: (0.737%) T: Interesting: @Barnes_Law on @StefanMolyneux discussing his defamation suit against Elizabeth Warren and Maggie Haberman and the Young Turks https://t.co/zdy6hHroCJ
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if people take advantage of race for influence and I said yes, look at Elizabeth Warren! Hypocrisy is obvious alive and well in your mind Elizabeth!
C: (0.981%) T: @CNN The Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren antifa suporter. I'm sure the hate pimps at CNN forgot to mention it. https://t.co/c6bILu5vgE
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was really an Indian. I said she'll tell any lie to get ahead.
C: (1.000%) T: @joewhitemusic @ninaturner @jjz1600 @washingtonpost @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren isn't here to help ensure a truly competitive, progressive candidate like Sanders is nominated.   A true progressive voice would endorse Sanders in 2016. Not stab him in the back &amp; throw shade at him during WeThePeople summit for not releasing his tax returns.
C: (1.000%) T: @intel_ghost @XArmandKleinX And he supported that very rich white lady who lied about being a redskin; I mean Indian. I think her name is Pocahontas; I mean Elizabeth Warren. ü§£
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Has anyone else noticed that Elizabeth Warren seems to have the same problems Hillary did?  Dishonest, entitled, a hypocrite, a bad temper and the help of CNN with skewed polls.  All the Dems come right off the ‚Äúfunny farm‚Äù.
C: (0.975%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth warren is a moron I said yes
C: (1.000%) T: @MrAndyNgo Well you know if you Worship Lucifer and Elizabeth Warren you have Brain Damage and Psychotic Tendencies and the people that are posting this Obviously are Psychopaths! Stay Safe! Without Journalists like you we dont hear the Truth!
C: (1.000%) T: Oh yeah I also don‚Äôt fault Elizabeth Warren for not wanting to go on Fox News out of integrity.  Also fair enough.  Let‚Äôs not fetishise talking to shitheads either.  But fine, let‚Äôs say talking to horrible people might be a decent strategy.  Just Warren has higher standards...
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR So,Elizabeth warren is a prostitute.she sold herself to the devil along with the rest of the demonrats!
C: (0.995%) T: @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump who listens to you-the liar -the propagandist-Elizabeth Warren disavowed Dayton shooter's support of her-while Trump continues to use inflammatory rhetoric and lies but you would know the strategy of lying wouldn't you
C: (0.987%) T: OHIO schutter ook LINKS  Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/nZDnxVl1oc via @washtimes
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get up and teach to show how smart I am. I get up and teach to show how smart you are, to help you have the power and the tools so that you can build what you want to build.‚Äù Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/QENAE4mtp7
C: (1.000%) T: O, please do not drop out!  This will look good on a resume.  I do believe we will have a woman president next, not sure if it will be Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren.  If you take Politics of Women of Color you might be ahead of the game! https://t.co/XozuVhTCXE
C: (0.993%) T: @JohnCarltonKing @kentindell @Akhil_election @johnb78 @YIMBY_Princeton @profmusgrave Government borrowing tends to be cheaper than commercial borrowing.  Elizabeth Warren has a plan for local government to update the internets where necessary. The US reaction has been extraordinary to my ears.  Fairly recent development - Eisenhower used fed cash for highways.
C: (0.972%) T: @ChatByCC Ohhh or let‚Äôs see the killers manifesto full of quotes from Elizabeth Warren directly linked to why he was carrying out the attacks.
C: (0.989%) T: @AOC If you want to blame trump for the El Paso shooting you should name Elizabeth warren for the Ohio shooting
