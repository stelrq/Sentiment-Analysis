C: (0.503%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions Exactly what inflammatory language can you pin on Elizabeth Warren. I thought so
C: (1.000%) T: @OneNastyWoman @BreitbartNews And what about the Dayton shooter who supported Antifa &amp; Elizabeth Warren? Or the guy who shot up the congressional baseball practice who was a Bernie Sanders supporter?

C: (1.000%) T: @kjerstinmandt @CSandbox @NanInKansas @Deb4CongressNM @jljacobson @ewarren This is how Elizabeth Warren, Obama and many other Democrats and Republicans side with #WallStreet over the People. Warren "tried" and failed again against #WallStreet. Tulsi and Beto on this list too. https://t.co/5kSw5KT959  #RegisterToVote Vote #Bernie2020! https://t.co/mp2QNtMerJ

C: (1.000%) T: @Honest_Ee @stonecold2050 In the case of the El Paso shooter, it is not clear, but he did appear to have been registered as a Democrat at least once.    In the case of the Toledo shooter, it is VERY clear.  He was a leftist who supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  https://t.co/MAerbOp52P

C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúTrump cozies up to white supremacists. He calls them fine fellows. He talks about getting brown and black people out of this country. He talks about shithole countries. This is what he does, the wink and the nod. He can‚Äôt have it both ways.‚Äù - Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/1jkah7kd2t

C: (0.988%) T: This argument for a President Warren is extremely strong.   Talking Teaching With Elizabeth Warren, the Most Professorial Candidate Ever https://t.co/AZztMo6lUO via @thecut
C: (1.000%) T: I wish we would not use the term "girl power" to describe Elizabeth Warren. It's so infantilizing. We don't need cutesy slogans, we need aggressive action. She's a grown woman, w/ a real agenda, &amp; we shouldn't rewrite her feminism to seem more palatable for misogynists
C: (1.000%) T: Reminder:  Elizabeth Warren used her families lie to say she was a Native American to get into the best schools and get jobs. This woman is not able to be Our President!!
