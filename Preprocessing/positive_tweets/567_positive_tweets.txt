C: (1.000%) T: "For Warren, the Socratic method did not further inequities; it was a tool to mitigate them."  Much to learn here. I may also begin class by asking "what is ‚Äòassumpsit‚Äô?‚Äù A bit weird for crim tho.  https://t.co/AfDuo5t92D
C: (1.000%) T: The last two times I‚Äôve met Elizabeth Warren I‚Äôve tried to jump out of the way so an intern or organizer can get their time instead. Each time she‚Äôs grabbed me and says there‚Äôs enough time for everyone.  Enough time for everyone. That‚Äôs what we need in the White House. https://t.co/rmp4b3DluQ
C: (1.000%) T: Part https://t.co/0ffFW23Pph will reap what you sow Elizabeth Warren. Everything you value is going to turn to ashes. You will never achieve happiness or prosperity
C: (1.000%) T: @brithume @rphfrank Elizabeth Warren just ended any hope for her campaign with that tweet about Brown. She absolutely panders more than anyone in the history of American politics. Un effing believable! What segment of society got the nod there ? The Thug criminals will surely vote for her now.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a lying weirdo. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: How do I get in on that ‚Äúhave a beer with Elizabeth Warren‚Äù thing? Because that sounds like fun, and also I have a plan for big, structural change involving Mitch McConnell and a manned mission to Mars.
C: (1.000%) T: @CHSommers @AOC I mostly agree. Good to see. The only problem is that when @AOC says "white supremacy," I don't know if she means people who believe that whites are superior or if she just means everyone to the political right of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked was Elizabeth Warren really fundraising off the dead victims that are not even buried yet? I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @Doctor_David One of my good friends donated $1 to a dem‚Äôs campaign, won a lottery for an all expenses paid trip to the most recent debate, and ran into Elizabeth Warren at the airport and got a pic üòÇüòÇ Amazing.
C: (0.577%) T: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders call for Walmart to stop selling guns, as workers protest the retail giant in the aftermath of deadly shootings in stores https://t.co/r0d2TX7pem
C: (0.999%) T: @TimHannan It‚Äôs amazing that someone would blame Trump for inspiring the WalMart shooting but not blame Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooting or blame Bernie Sanders for the Republican baseball practice shooting. Are you willingly hypocritical or did you hit your head really hard?
C: (0.994%) T: @mezbourian @FightDaPower I‚Äôm loving Elizabeth Warren and of course Bernie. I‚Äôll most likely caucus for Warren this election, but whoever gets the nomination gets my vote!
C: (1.000%) T: New polling shows Elizabeth Warren on the rise, Steve Kornacki goes to the big board. https://t.co/fwfUr3ZYh3
C: (0.999%) T: @BridgetKF30 @DNC @georgesoros @POTUS Every mass murder shooter has been a Democrat, a leftist or a Muslim.  The Dayton shooter was inspired by the hateful rhetoric of Elizabeth Warren and the El Paso shooter was influenced by his belief in climate change and the Democratic debate.  George soros hand is in everything

C: (1.000%) T: @FrankConniff Wrong. Ridiculous amounts of us are voting policy over platitudes. And if candidates repeatedly flip flop on issues &amp; support corporate options as Elizabeth Warren has, they don't just automatically get our vote. Come &amp; get it.
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions When Elizabeth Warren vilifies entire populations and races, and starts using racist dog whistles, get back to us and try again.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Donald Trump Is A White Supremacist. She tells it like it is.  I admire her and he leadership so much. What we could be . . . https://t.co/GVXSy26rys
