C: (0.995%) T: @theinformedwin @lisastark351 @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump So, according to your (flawed) reasoning, Elizabeth Warren is also alt-right, funny conclusion ü§î
C: (1.000%) T: @MrAndyNgo @antifaintl @AntiFashGordon @saeen90_ @GrimKim @jaredlholt @EmilyGorcenski @drmistercody @elivalley Also, please cite ANY language the shooter quoted from Elizabeth Warren that can be linked to his motivation to slaughter innocent people? Was it free college education, elimination of student loan debt or healthcare for all? Thanks!
C: (1.000%) T: @Alyssa_Milano @JoeBiden I was so impressed with Biden Alyssa.  He did not read from a TelePrompTer. Nor did he speak in a monotone voice. Of all the presidential candidates, he was the best. And I am for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.989%) T: @ProudResister @BillKristol Take it to trending. I deserve Elizabeth Warren, too.üòä
C: (0.984%) T: @molratty And yet, he supports Elizabeth Warren ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
C: (1.000%) T: If Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic nominee and you don't vote for her because she's not progressive enough and vote INSTEAD for Jill Stein, there is only one possible explanation: misogyny.   See how stupid this dude is? https://t.co/KJhzcG5p3N
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Blames Trump For El Paso Shooting Despite Dayton Shooter Being Her Supporter: She really is on thin ground. https://t.co/By2JQg5CGy &lt;&lt;- https://t.co/Z15DblZcU0
C: (1.000%) T: @virtual_joanne But only blue lives matter is what did this. He was triggered by Elizabeth Warren. How fitting you‚Äôd make this about politics instead of just being compassionate. Voting blue = more murders. Do you support murderers Joanne? B/c planned parenthood kills babies... just saying üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
C: (1.000%) T: CONFIRMED: Democrat Dayton Shooter Advocated For Socialism, Elizabeth Warren, Satanism, &amp; The Recent Firebombing of an ICE Facility by an Auntie-Fa Extremists.  He had also interacted with many of the  leading left-wing figures on ü§´Sh..itterüí© https://t.co/sk02dmClc8

C: (1.000%) T: @ScottOReilly1 @NRA Uh... the El Paso shooter was a self avowed socialist who supported Universal Basic Income.  The Ohio Shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. The Chicago Shooter was a registered Democrat, and the California shooter was a leftist..
C: (0.987%) T: The media is portraying El Paso &amp; Dayton shootings as driven by 'white supremacy' &amp; trying to blame Republicans.   But the Dayton shooter was a liberal who identified as a "leftist". Was a supporter of socialism, Antifa, Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders.  https://t.co/AWT1dc23FY
C: (1.000%) T: @jamisonfoser @charliekirk11 And has Elizabeth Warren ever chuckled appreciatively and quipped "Only in the panhandle could you get away with that!" when a supporter shouted, "Shoot 'em!" about some "not like us" group of fellow humans?
C: (1.000%) T: 1) by the lefts standards/logic of Shapiro and Trump caused El Paso then Cody and Elizabeth Warren caused Dayton 2) also making fun of a gay minority‚Äôs accent seems insensitive according to leftist logic 3) I love watching leftists get mad when they‚Äôre treated like conservatives https://t.co/inbyf12y3y
C: (1.000%) T: @FrankConniff I personally will not vote for Elizabeth Warren.  Her policies will do very little to change my life in a beneficial way and she won't be able to beat Trump.
C: (0.986%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Remember when Elizabeth Warren said a certain group of people were bringing drugs, bringing crime, they're rapists? Neither do I. https://t.co/qTJ1VB5heM
C: (1.000%) T: 'White supremacist' is a liberal talking point.    There's as much white supremacy in this country as Elizabeth Warren is native american.
C: (1.000%) T: @thedailybeast When you mention domestic terrorism, remember the Bernie Sanders supporter (Hodgkins) who shot and almost killed Steve Scalise. And be sure to remember the Dayton shooter who supported Socialism, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. He sounds like a Democratic Progressive.....

C: (1.000%) T: "If Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic nominee and you don't vote for her because she's not progressive enough, there is only one possible explanation: misogyny."  Or what about "because she's not progressive enough"??? https://t.co/kJ37kWf8Hx
