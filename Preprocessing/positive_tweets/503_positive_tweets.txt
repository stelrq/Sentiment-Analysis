C: (1.000%) T: I will vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is but having said that how about a ticket Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. I believe this gives us a winning ticket and also a good chance for woman president in the future.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/lRSwqzDPJM

C: (1.000%) T: I would've liked to heard more. Farmer is right... Technology vs Nature.  He's wise - but wouldn't say he "destroys Elizabeth Warren." He's trying to educate. Appreciate that. https://t.co/7SdrBJ7kZP

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a white supremacist. I said yes but she thinks sheâ€™s an Indian.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I asked a  group of people if they believed Elizabeth Warren was going to be president. The whole room erupted in laughter.
C: (0.637%) T: @CecileRichards @AOC both shooters were registered democrats. One supported Elizabeth Warren.  the 3rd mass shooting that the left wing media wants to ignore, was in Chicago...gang related black on black  crime. 7 dead, numerous injured.  white supremacy trend? Dont think so. Know your facts!
C: (1.000%) T: @RashidaTlaib So the mass shooter who supported Elizabeth Warren was inspired by Trump?  Iâ€™m a little confused....
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions No, dude. False equivalence. Elizabeth Warren never talks about residents of Dayton "infesting" or "invading," nor has she advised people at her rallies to beat up protestors.''  You need a refresher class in logic.
C: (1.000%) T: @bigsickbody @BlakeDontCrack I agree with the sentiment of your contention, but I do not agree that anybody running for president so they have the power to make the lives of the african-american community better is inherently a white supremacist. Elizabeth Warren isnt my first choice, but she's not a racist

C: (0.892%) T: @JoAnnNYNY @kimguilfoyle Because there are lunatics, like the Elizabeth Warren supporter who just shot up a bar in Dayton, and the Bernie Sanders shooter who shoot up a congressional base ball game.
C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 Is that like the shooting that was perpetuated by a person who supported Elizabeth Warren? Or the Christchurch shooting where he said he did not support Trump but the media changed that narrative.
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is anti-American. I said yes.

C: (1.000%) T: @KaitMarieox Hey this last mass shooter is a Elizabeth warren supporter.  All her supporters must be white supremacists. Or it must be her rehteric they like.
C: (1.000%) T: @ksparky13 @Hoosiers1986 @ewarren Elizabeth warren is a white supremacist she supports planned parenthoods genocide of black children
