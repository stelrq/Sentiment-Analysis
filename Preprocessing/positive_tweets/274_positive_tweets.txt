C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN I love the way you deflect by lying and completely turning everything around. You know you have stoked the flames of racism and violence and now you're turning everything around making it sound like it's Bernie and Elizabeth Warren's fault.. you really are a piece of shit.
C: (1.000%) T: Long read: Elizabeth Warren's Classroom Strategy  A lifelong teacher, she's the most professorial presidential candidate ever. But does America want to be taught?  https://t.co/0isCQGuaWQ https://t.co/Mxr6JHla6J
C: (1.000%) T: @AnnaApp91838450 @politico America wasn't built on lies Elizabeth Warren America was built on the backs of the hard-working Americans and the men and women who gave their life to protect America not the lies that you Democratic people are spewing stop the lying and stop with the crumbs and the free for all
C: (0.991%) T: @bethpotter88 @JohnCornyn God said....."Cornyn....stop with the Elizabeth Warren....left leaning Dayton shooter bullshit.....it's not helping ....if you want to help...keep the crap to yourself..."
C: (0.719%) T: @InfoNMP @lumby07 @washingtonpost Dayton Ohio shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter so it only makes sense that she should be to blame.  Oh wait just only when it‚Äôs a republican, right?
C: (1.000%) T: @hulatribunal @EvaB57423389 @RealSaavedra I come from a big family and there are people who show up at reunions who I am completely clueless about. It's interesting to me how you can think of a bunch of strangers as your family just based on their skin color. Is Elizabeth Warren your family? Prince Harry?
C: (1.000%) T: @dandrezner Elizabeth Warren sure is going to love the big golden Ts plastered over everything.
C: (0.989%) T: She might recall just a short while ago an Elizabeth Warren supporter, a liberal radical, committed a mass shooting in her city. https://t.co/XkhBQsGfpr
C: (1.000%) T: @IngrahamAngle So, is there any truth to the Dayton shooter's following of Elizabeth Warren? If so, why are we not hearing that in the news?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to make sure Americans get occasion
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis What about the guy in Dayton who was an Antifa Supporter (the terrorist group supported by Dems) and an Elizabeth Warren fan? Y'all created those flames, when will you take credit for them?
C: (0.994%) T: @justinamash @NancyLRogers1 Which words and actions would you point to? Perhaps the shooters' own words citing Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and parroting Democrat talking points?

C: (0.642%) T: @GideonCRozner She's Australia's Elizabeth Warren. The left like to demonize the USA except when it's one of their own. And when she's importing USA dysfunction and hate.
C: (0.987%) T: @alexis_krieg Love it! Could cut out this headline and post it on the big board! @ashleyn1cole https://t.co/3fxpVL2Et1
C: (1.000%) T: I‚Äôm way too fucking mad to be on Twitter right now. For some reason I am finding more &amp; more idiots on my feed.   AND fuck you anyone who is mad at Elizabeth Warren for calling out white supremacy as a problem.
C: (0.700%) T: @ImpeachTrump012 @realDonaldTrump Guy drives to Dayton says he's a socialist a Bernie supporter and Elizabeth Warren supporter. Then goes to shooting innocent ppl. guess that proves the Democratic socialists are just as violent as evil as any Republican. Thoughts ü§î btw stfu
C: (1.000%) T: Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù @OANN  I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you! https://t.co/Kla9zWvKxo

C: (1.000%) T: @TheRickWilson You r be $5 a l nth, every o nth to Elizabeth Warren and whoever wins the primary will get $5/month after that, although I hope it's President Warren, I'm PROUD to support Any of our Candidates. See how easy that is? If you know your choice is a decent human no need for shame.
C: (0.987%) T: @MrAndyNgo Dayton shooter was a Bernie and Elizabeth Warren supporter. He also had strong ties to ANTIFA
C: (1.000%) T: @iMakeArtifacts @thatgirlfrmOhio he also supported elizabeth warren, we gonna go around pointing that out at every opportunity as well?
C: (0.999%) T: @ICUFamous That‚Äôs your opinion and you are still free to express it. Just as I‚Äôm free to say that you‚Äôre wrong. Trump has no more to do with what the El Paso shooter did than Elizabeth Warren had to do with the Dayton or Bernie Sanders had to do with the DC baseball diamond shooting.
