C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren on the rise in latest polling https://t.co/bBv612r4XQ
C: (1.000%) T: No. Just because you donâ€™t trust Elizabeth Warren or Kamila Harris or Joe Biden to run the USA, that doesnâ€™t make you a white supremacist or the anti-Christ. It makes you sane. https://t.co/q57pJ9LcQA
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Not our first rodeo. In 1913, income tax applied to 4% of population. Top rate for handful who earned $500,000 was â€¦ wait for it â€¦ 6%. Dems say they will only tax wealthy, but soon youâ€™ll find yourself lumped in with the Hampton folks. Fool me once ... https://t.co/Bmcevm0J56
C: (0.995%) T: @AmandiOnAir @ewarren I love Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @TexasAmerica @thehill You didn't answer the question. How are Elizabeth Warren's policies - none of which I would bet you've read - worse than dehumanizing brown people?
C: (1.000%) T: @carriecoon He's been, laughably, thumping his chest for years that he'd take on Elizabeth Warren. Personally would love to see him move out of Massachusetts, but not at the cost of him being anywhere near D.C.  Complete nutjob.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren, Native American, woman of color, peddling racism.I hope you thought enuf of Mike Browns family &amp; officer Wilsons family that you discussed your new campaign strategy claiming mike browns murder. A true televangelist https://t.co/ErPEjawPSa
C: (0.549%) T: Anything that comes from Elizabeth Warren's or Bernie Sander's mouth cannot be trusted is all nothing but lies and more lies !!! ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿ https://t.co/SXOlpUnN9l
C: (0.991%) T: Elizabeth Warren sat down with @nprpolitics podcast to discuss her ideas for big structural change in America. Check it out here!  #Warren2020 #TeamWarren  https://t.co/S6uF74KHbV
C: (1.000%) T: If Bernie really wanted to achieve his goals, he'd withdraw and endorse Elizabeth Warren, who has a head on her shoulders a stack of actual plans, and a ton of her own followers. But he'd rather fail while getting a lot of attention -- and blaming it on the press.
C: (1.000%) T: @TheTattooedProf last year he thought he'd run for Senate vs. Elizabeth Warren. apparently he's figured out Arizona is a better place to peddle his simple-minded bullshit.
C: (1.000%) T: @H4N4W4LT @TeamWarren @GIPHY Haha, she got so much grief for having a beer on a video; this is a funny response to that! Come on. I love ALL the Democratic candidates (well, mostly), but if you look at a picture that screams "PRESIDENT!" it's Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims with legislation she can reduce gun deaths by 80%. What an idiotic statement. The only way you do this is by a full out ban. #GunReformNow #GunControl
C: (1.000%) T: @NateSilver538 Nate ignoring her total non-support among blacks, yet people know you as a data person? Other national polls have also shown Warren polling single digits w/black Americans, often well behind Biden, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).  https://t.co/UN2OYIpFfu
C: (1.000%) T: #LieawathaWarren Funny don't recall any of the new Walmart associates taking on any of the risk to start a company and maintain a company like Walmart.   But Elizabeth Warren is just fine with misrepresenting a lot of things like "I'm Native American because my daddy said I  have https://t.co/spS6aojOSQ
C: (1.000%) T: For those lamenting Charlie Manuel's age (75), keep this in mind:  Bernie Sanders:77 Joe Biden:76 Donald Trump:73 Hillary Clinton:71 Elizabeth Warren:70  Millions voted/will vote for each of these people to run the country. Charlie just needs to teach how to hit good. #Phillies
C: (0.974%) T: @joncoopertweets And yet they'll still vote Republican especially if Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee.
C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren ELIZABETH WARREN/BERNIE SANDERS:  CREATING &amp; RAMPING UP MORE HATRED &amp; RESENTMENT 4 FELLOW AMERICANS.  BECAUSE ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN SHOT UP YET.  STOP.  JUST STOP. TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE FOR AWHILE.  (Bernie RAGS on Walmart for THREE WEEKS then Paso shooter, COINCIDENCE?)
C: (1.000%) T: What an Elizabeth Warren economy would look like as a cake. https://t.co/FeYow5nOh9
C: (1.000%) T: @MtnMD @stephen46785 @Ellahbie @MarcusEdelstein Actually , I just Googled open Secrets Elizabeth Warren Securities and found out she has almost four hundred grand from them. Bernie 14k
C: (1.000%) T: I literally still tear up every time I hear Elizabeth Warren speak and Iâ€™m not even  getting sick of it (even though I should turn her off since I just finished my eye makeup)
