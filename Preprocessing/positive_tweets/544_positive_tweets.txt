C: (1.000%) T: Are you aware the El Paso shooter was enraged the democrat candidates at debate raised their hands for FREE healthcare for illegals? Are you aware the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren &amp; followed Antifa? You only mention what suits your biased @cnn agenda, not the truth! https://t.co/x24z1Vk8HH

C: (0.997%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN I do not like antifa , but they do not exert mass casualties.  Bernie Sanders , And Elizabeth Warren are preaching hatred from the podium. You might need to change your rhetoric. And change your ideology.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù @OANN  I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!
C: (1.000%) T: @Manning4USCong @AzLeggs @JoaquinCastrotx You don‚Äôt need an address and an employer to look up donations. Just go get Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs donor information and publish her top donors. I‚Äôm not one of them, but if my $5 is important to you, put my name there, too.

C: (1.000%) T: Rural &amp; exurban America is already heavily subsidized and the people who live there have outsized political power that they wield like a weapon.  Why should the rest of the country subsidize this? Shouldn‚Äôt we encourage people to move to productive areas?  https://t.co/T3FIhTXeN3

C: (1.000%) T: @theArrjee @CaptinMoonlite @NelStamp I not only read, but I see imagery of Steve Scalise being shot and video of the infatuation the Dayton murderer had for Elizabeth Warren. Just sayin.
C: (1.000%) T: @WashTimes Notice he doesn't say: Elizabeth Warren's words 'not far at all' from language linked to accused Dayton accuser.  That's because only Right-wing speech is problematic for our good comrades.  ...Funny, I thought all legal speech, was legal.
C: (1.000%) T: ATTN: DAYTON OHIO PLEASE SEND YOUR TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO GREET  OUR GREAT PRESIDENT! He is being attacked by crazy snowflakes who don't care that the KILLER love Elizabeth Warren and Antifa member!
C: (1.000%) T: @WalshFreedom I really like Elizabeth Warren. She is very smart. And also very likable. You go  Elizabeth Warren. You are a good person. And you have been doing good things for at least 30 years.üòÄüòÉüëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/JqtLGBKWlQ via @twitchyteam
C: (1.000%) T: @TheRevAl BTW: I see that you have not commented on.. https://t.co/IssyhrUJ02  I think that Pocahontas is responsible for the shooter if @potus is responsible for the other NUT JOB!
C: (1.000%) T: @SenatorDurbin Wrong dumbass the Ohio guy was a Antifi supporter and a democrat that supported Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders you know this but you lie anyway shows you have no moral character and that you are a piece of crap politician! Why can people not see this!! Wake up he is a liar!

C: (1.000%) T: In retrospect, it's amazing how a key argument of Elizabeth Warren's seminal 2003 book, The Two Income Trap, is the same from her stump speech today- how her mother supported a family on one income in the 1960s. @ewarren's cause has been the same for decades.  #BookLoversDay

C: (0.986%) T: @ewarren Funny,  I was asked weather Elizabeth Warren is an American Indian. I said NO. and she ain't no American either.
C: (1.000%) T: @elva_morris @ClistonBrown And in regard to Elizabeth Warren I see that her squeaky, warbling voice, combined with her sort of preachiness turns people off on her.
C: (1.000%) T: @nikole74 @montique47 @RedwoodGirl @Michael07079 @ddale8 It's a great idea, soak the rich and make everything free. He will never get elected President. At least he's not just offering to buy your vote for $1000/month. Elizabeth Warren sells it much better. She makes it not only seem possible, but FUN!
