C: (1.000%) T: @DAVID_W_CARLSON @repjohnlewis He supported Elizabeth Warren. Doesn‚Äôt fit their narrative.
C: (0.996%) T: @BetoORourke So Elizabeth Warren bears responsibility for the Dayton shooting, right? Based on this principle, she does.
C: (0.995%) T: @LuResists @JohnCornyn Hypocrisy becomes you. The Dayton Ohio shooter praised Elizabeth Warren and socialism as his reasons. Try and catch up...
C: (0.533%) T: @hardball @JoaquinCastrotx so I assume you will blame Elizabeth Warren for the Ohio shooting then right? Here's a novel thought, how about blaming the gunman? Dems are ridiculous!
C: (0.571%) T: @charliekirk11 Charlie, this is not rocket science. Trump incites racial hatred and violence with his tweets and his Redneck Rallies. Elizabeth Warren preaches acceptance and inclusion. She does not incite violence. See the difference?
C: (1.000%) T: I love the juxtaposition here of white supremacist vs. Elizabeth Warren supporter. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a white supremacist, he‚Äôs a democrat.‚Äù Almost makes you think that white supremacist is becoming increasingly synonymous with the opposite of a Democrat... https://t.co/vIENb0kgAD
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Heavily armed men are obviously supporting liberals like Elizabeth Warren, try again Geraldo.
C: (0.966%) T: @RyanAFournier Does it matter who he supported?  Did Elizabeth Warren instigate hate?
C: (0.999%) T: @SenWarren you're a threat to American (&amp; world) security &amp; safety, #Pochahontas!go back where you came from! https://t.co/fqexLDaZyj https://t.co/Ozb2C0t3iC
C: (1.000%) T: @MyLifeIsMunitz Bernie Sanders in first place, by far. Elizabeth Warren a distant second. Tulsi Gabbard a maybe in third.
C: (1.000%) T: @nanwhaley Mayor,  you encourage protests against the President when he comes to Dayton. You do realize the perpetrator was ab Elizabeth Warren supporter and Antifa supporter? Will you be encouraging protests against them as well?
C: (1.000%) T: @NBCNews I hear the guy is a Warren supporter. Is that the Elizabeth Warren "free" Assault Rifle and 100 round mag donation gift? ü§î
C: (0.981%) T: @perillo_joshua @Kathatestrump @seanhannity @maddow @ewarren Haha The Elizabeth Warren Shooter was inspired by the extreme hate filled rhetoric of the socialist left.  @ewarren is unlikely to recover from this politically without a national apology tour
C: (0.987%) T: @PaulVolk4 @MommaBear2201 @riza_blade @eugenegu @ewarren @realDonaldTrump Okay, I looked at the article you posted and it has absolutely nothing that in any way indicates that Elizabeth Warren condoned Antifa or violence against anyone. Again, if you have a source that actually says what you claim, post it.
C: (0.994%) T: @ladydashby Are the donors embarrassed because they support Trump? I donated to Elizabeth Warren and Amy McGrath and I don't care who knows it!  BTW, you may have been raised Liberal &amp; Democrat, but you're a MAGAt now! (Read your tweets)
C: (1.000%) T: Yeah that's funny all the fake news I believe failed to mention he supported Elizabeth Warren!! now Democrat ideology!!! doesn't that make Warren responsible!!! https://t.co/VK0ap6YNne
C: (0.993%) T: #NEW on @OANN: A spokesperson for Sen. Elizabeth Warren addresses the Dayton shooter (expressed support for her and  far-left ideologies): ‚Äúthere is a direct line between the president's rhetoric and the stated motivations of the El Paso shooter.‚Äù https://t.co/hNPWB1pyiV
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC What about one of the shooters supporting Elizabeth Warren. Does she get another pass
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis Waiting for you to address the shooters who quoted AOC and were supporters for Elizabeth Warren. You know, as long as we are blaming people other than the asshat who made the decision to pull the trigger.
C: (1.000%) T: @pepesgrandma @IlhanMN What about the Dayton shooter, news flash Elizabeth Warren set him off!
C: (0.960%) T: Dayton this person was a Elizabeth Warren worshiper why isnt this her fault wake up America but the news isnt reporting this so you sleep
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren @ewarren ¬∑ 2h Two background check bills passed the House months ago. But Mitch McConnell is refusing to let the Senate vote on them.  @SenateMajLdr : Call us back into session. We need #GunReformNow. https://t.co/hV9B91uNye
C: (0.731%) T: Rude to women. Always. Elizabeth Warren being a prime example. https://t.co/fO8y2Ff3Gf
C: (1.000%) T: Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed ‚Äúpro-Satan‚Äù views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren. Yet the lame-stream media says they can't find a motive.
C: (0.990%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a plan to counter evil ISPs with public broadband https://t.co/IezpQKG2iw https://t.co/gyXUShY4Nj
