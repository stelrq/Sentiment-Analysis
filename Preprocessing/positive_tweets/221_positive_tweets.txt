C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Tell us about Elizabeth Warren and the Ohio shooter who was a big fan, then. You won't do that will you, you clown.
C: (0.794%) T: Elizabeth Warren is blasting THE LIGHT by Common right now yeeeesssss
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren  Cory Booker  Hillary Clinton  Obama  Nancy Pelosi  Kamala Harris  I could go on all day there's so many https://t.co/eoBpqdsSlh
C: (1.000%) T: @mike_axelrod @charliekirk11 @ewarren Hey Charlie. Before you crawl back in your hole please post the Dayton shooters manifesto or screed quoting Elizabeth Warren. Also are you spending more time on your knees kissing Trumps ass as @VP directed?
C: (0.983%) T: It turns out, these people are part of a group called AZ Patriots. I remembered them suddenly disappearing at last Thursday's event and this was why. https://t.co/Gj2MY1SPa3
C: (1.000%) T: @StopThugsNow @KamalaHarris Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed ‚Äúpro-Satan‚Äù views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/h3i23Pn0Cy
C: (0.989%) T: @BillKristol @DevinCow We all deserve Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.985%) T: @homer_n_peter @PardesSeleh The Ohio shooter used msnbc and Elizabeth warren talking points....
C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker Yes, I‚Äôm sure Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren will.  You on the other hand need to go take a nap.
C: (1.000%) T: Charlie.  Would you please let us have the quotes from @ewarren that lead to or encouraged the Dayton shooting. Where did the shooter say that he was a fan of Senator Warren. I'm one of Elizabeth Warren's biggest fans. I have no inclination to go on a shooting rampage. https://t.co/NrHSFkxsQA
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN I have a question? What about the Dayton shooter who is a Socialist and an Elizabeth Warren supporter. I completely condemn white nationalism. Will you condemn the violent socialist and the eco facism of the El Paso shooter. OR, does it, like I think, hit too close to home?
C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders Attention Bernie supporters ,Please make sure to say Tulsi Gabbard when the pollsters call you this month. DNC is actively trying to cheat her out of the debates.We need her to get above 2% so she can be an attack dog for Bernie against Kamala and Elizabeth Warren #Bernie2020
C: (1.000%) T: @difficultharith @NotRexaur @V1kt03 @zenithvox @h3h3productions You do also know that one of the shooters was pro-gun control and supported Elizabeth Warren, don't you?

C: (0.997%) T: @Trump2020Yuge @tanajam @TaggertGirl @davidwebbshow @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl @JGilliam_SEAL @WilkowMajority @TheDemocrats @GOP @TwitchyTeam @thehill @jack White supremacist is two words and they're both English. I love antifa why would I disavow them. The KKK supports Republicans. Elizabeth Warren never demonized or dehumanized anyone, that's trump. Dayton killed his own sister. They don't know if there was any political motivation
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Nice try! Nothing that Elizabeth Warren has said has lead to any murders.  He didn‚Äôt write a manifesto, quoting Elizabeth Warren, like the El Paso shooter did.  It‚Äôs unfortunate that Republicans cannot confront Trump on his racism, and stand up and say that this is wrong!
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/KeYyzWbfKl  Love this profile of Warren as expert educator and how those skills would serve her as president.
C: (1.000%) T: @Peter_shirley @Reedbeta @shortalbino @AndrewYang This is my problem with Elizabeth Warren. I respect her and think she has a lot of plans and ideas but she does not seem to understand automation and prefers a more interventionist approach to protecting jobs.
C: (1.000%) T: the people who usually say we shouldn‚Äôt politicize these shootings sure are goin nuts over the fact the dayton kid liked elizabeth warren
C: (1.000%) T: @mkraju What did Elizabeth Warren say  when asked about the Ohio shooter supporting her?
C: (0.992%) T: @hardball @JoaquinCastrotx This hate monger and race pimp can't make enough TV appearances trying to PERSONALLY capitalize on a national tragedy. Where is his list of Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs contributors since the Dayton shooter supported her? There is none Castro is the one who inspires hate and violence.
C: (1.000%) T: Let me break the shooting down for you Trump haters, the Dayton shooter supported Antifa, Bernie, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie was not responsible for the shooter in the baseball park a few years back who supported Bernie fully.....in Contrast Trump is not responsible for this...
C: (1.000%) T: @morningmika You obviously have no idea what the word: ‚ÄúRacist,‚Äù means. BTW:The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan and the El Paso shooter was not a fan of Trump and said he wanted to kill long before Trump was President. What say you about that?
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner Hey Robbie. I've noticed that you and your Hollywood pals are conveniently leaving Dayton, Ohio out of your rhetoric.  Why is that?  Could it be that Conner Betts was a Liberal who supported Socialism and followed Elizabeth Warren? #Hypocrite  #DaytonShooting #ElizabethWarren
C: (0.611%) T: Pretty sure his misogyny -- he kept RAPE LISTS -- is far more relevant here than his atheism or RTing of Elizabeth Warren, since there's zero evidence he was politically motivated. https://t.co/xQPpNeVfGP
