C: (1.000%) T: @denisethewriter @DrJasonJohnson Doesn't sound like "force" - Elizabeth Warren is a worthy candidate for consideration, methinks. (And let's go with "their"...)
C: (1.000%) T: @MarcusEdelstein I support Elizabeth Warren, but if she's not nominated to run for POTUS, then whoever is the candidate, I would hope she'd be his/her running mate. She is the REAL ADULT IN THE ROOM. I also like Bernie.

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren It‚Äôd be nice if Elizabeth Warren ‚Äúhad a plan‚Äù for anything in her own state.  She got elected and immediately started campaigning for president.  She‚Äôs a lying, hypocritical, loud mouthed, talker. Lots of promises, no action to bring her words to fruition.....

C: (1.000%) T: @baddestmamajama @Fitz456 @benpearceca No what pisses ppl off is that she wouldn‚Äôt be in any position without her misappropriation of her heritage, that‚Äôs the part you don‚Äôt understand.  It wasn‚Äôt a simple mistake, it was a lifetime of lies that she was called out for. Rachel Dolezal meet Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Democratic candidates could easily marginalize Bernie Sanders because he is a ridiculous man.  The problem is Elizabeth Warren, who has decided to appropriate all of his positions and give them a patina of viability.  That is what is pulling down the field.

C: (1.000%) T: @ndrew_lawrence I hear the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders fan and in Antifa.  I've yet to hear ONE Dem leader denounce Antifa.  Will you do so now?  I hear the El Paso shooter was all over the place (environmental extremist).   Where do you link this to white Supremacy?

C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Dayton killer's BS support of Elizabeth Warren is just that, BS. This man killed his SISTER! He deliberately threw out that red herring to mask his true ideology: racism, bigotry, misogyny, just like Trump. I believe his classmates.
