C: (1.000%) T: @kylegriffin1 Democrats love what Indigenous people know to be the white supremacy of Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/J67m7vXaJB A strategy that would define Liz‚Äîquiet on the cares of Native peoples. From the Senate gallery she called for the arrest of a Crow Creek Sioux activist protesting DAPL

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs agriculture plan is spectacularly bad. It's just price controls with a speech ripped from a bad ex who's trying to convince you that this time will be different
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris Murder???  You Are So Full of Shit, you make Injun Elizabeth Warren look like she's Honest Abe - And She only tells the truth 1/1024 of the time.   #DespicableDemocrats
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is an idiot. Want faster and more access? Just let the fucking market work! That's why I have in Romania better and cheaper internet than ANY area of the USA. Because the politicians were dumb enough not to know it exists so no regulation. https://t.co/i2OkjrNX4p
C: (1.000%) T: Facts matter. Outcomes matter. Always look beyond the headline before assuming it‚Äôs true. Especially if that headline or statement conveniently fits your current beliefs.  Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs Ferguson Lie https://t.co/ZwItFUg4GT
C: (1.000%) T: @HeidiPriebe1 I think Elizabeth Warren is an xNTP. She can conceptualize a plan for various issues in thoughtful ways.  I think Kamala Harris is an xNTJ. She's brilliant but a bit narrow in perspective in comparison, i.e. she may conceive of new ideas but committed to conventional frameworks.
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr You really think you even have 1/100th the economic knowledge of Elizabeth Warren???  You‚Äôre delusional.  Of course every knows that.

C: (0.995%) T: Policy wishes are now headlines, even though the article clearly says the 80% goal is "impossible" and "unlikely"  Please add these kinds of modifiers to the headline  https://t.co/dJth5hHhKQ
C: (0.996%) T: @PhilCase13 @vin9251 @DiamondandSilk Wrong. The shooter in Ohio was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Blaming Trump for these shootings is like blaming the baker for making you fat. There's a thing called personal responsibility, which is apparently lacking these days.

C: (1.000%) T: I also get the sense none of them will go after Elizabeth Warren. And vice-versa.
C: (1.000%) T: @RightHookUSA @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is easily and willfully duped.
C: (1.000%) T: @JRubinBlogger The real issue here is that we‚Äôre saying that Elizabeth Warren is some kind of  creature that can‚Äôt exist in our democracy, because she‚Äôs asking for stable college, stable wages, stable healthcare, and all the millionaires and billionaires are terrified.
C: (0.988%) T: No way. Elizabeth Warren all the way. https://t.co/CBAdnAJgA6
C: (0.732%) T: "The Democratic Party of Polk County [Iowa] put out a call for the presidential campaigns to contribute volunteers for some county project and the Warren campaign here filled nearly all of the spots almost immediately." https://t.co/YEO6K08d4I
C: (1.000%) T: @stranahan The Iowa Rancher that spoke to Liz Warren explained how "well-managed grassland where you rotationally allow cattle to graze ‚Äì you‚Äôre actually going to use more CO2 and sequester more carbon because of the regrowth all the time."  https://t.co/0PFdAgT8SS
C: (1.000%) T: @KatyTurNBC They won't take the chance and vote for someone like Elizabeth Warren who would change things, and the media is part and parcel of scaring the voter since they're owned by big corporations which support people like Trump.
C: (0.977%) T: @PeterWelch By your logic, Bernie is responsible for @SteveScalise being shot and Elizabeth Warren responsible for Dayton Ohio shooting.
