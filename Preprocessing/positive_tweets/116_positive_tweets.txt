C: (0.994%) T: @BernieSanders Democrats are told that this party is the party looking out for people of color. The three front runners are joe Biden, Elizabeth warren and Bernie Sanders. Nope nothing rigged here. https://t.co/r810ZvekbC
C: (0.994%) T: Democrats in Iowa Offer Plans to Combat Gun Violence https://t.co/Y7WuHaEJG1 Lots of ways we could work to reduce violence and suicide via guns.
C: (1.000%) T: I watch Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren interact with people, and it's like, "Wow.  This is what a decent human being is like.  Imagine that." #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #Democrats #BlueWave2020
C: (1.000%) T: @JimericanTweets EW is a wacky one. I imagine that if we had another 9/11 style attack on the US, Elizabeth Warren would start campaigning for Ilhan Omar to be the first woman president.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren’s Ferguson Lie https://t.co/jnJr4FrfQ6  She is an opportunistic lying piece of garbage! If this is the best they got then CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR 2nd TERM MR PRESIDENT! @POTUS
C: (1.000%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr I know that Elizabeth Warren worked very hard to get to where she is today. Just curious if you have worked an honest day in your silver spoon fed life?
C: (0.998%) T: @noahforchange @sweetbabyjosi There is always a line of people waiting to get into Trump’s rallies.  Your idea wouldn’t hurt Trump’s rallies at all.  Now, if you did that at a Beto O’Rourke or Elizabeth Warren rally,  no one would be there!
C: (1.000%) T: Urging retailers is one step. When nearly 9 in 10 Americans support universal background checks, it seems as though lawmakers would listen. https://t.co/p5DffmibXV
C: (1.000%) T: Wow. Watching a TV game show. And celebs don't know who is Leslie Jones, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Elizabeth Warren, and Simone Biles.
C: (1.000%) T: @Meisheaven @Dre_Qns @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump for its dark, satirical themes of sexual violence delivered for shock value  He had posted tweets that opposed Donald Trump and supported Elizabeth Warren, made favorable references about Satan, and described himself as a "leftist".
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris Check Elizabeth Warren’s comments. She basically endorsed you for president. You won’t go the distance, but one more down. She referred to the future president as “she”. Not as herself. I assume it’s you
C: (0.978%) T: @marklevinshow What? Alternative Facts? Hate peddling pathological liar fits one person perfectly and that person isn’t Elizabeth Warren; that person already occupies the Oval Office. If your ignorance wasn’t so strong, you might see the actual problem.
C: (0.995%) T: @IWashington I dont know who's more irritating: Kamala, Elizabeth Warren, or Hillary....
C: (0.984%) T: @VAKruta @PeteBelmonte @SharylAttkisson Another huge Gaffe from self proclaimed Native Indian Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Brit Hume @brithume  Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter Friday that Michael Brown was “murdered” by a “white” policeman in Ferguson, Mo. This is an absolute whopper and obviously does nothing to... https://t.co/I7t79R5Nlz
C: (0.999%) T: @FarmBureau On 8/7, Elizabeth Warren tweeted:  "Agriculture has become one of the biggest polluters in our economy, thanks to decades of failed policy. By paying farmers to fight climate change and investing in R&amp;D we can tackle climate change."  WARNING! It's a takeover disguised as help!
C: (1.000%) T: @BassedInShow I wish I had taken a photo of the reporters surrounding Elizabeth Warren. They gave her absolutely zero room to move.  The caption would have been “when you open a pack of gum in class”
C: (1.000%) T: @Bob39613968 And Elizabeth Warren is now parroting it. She's using Michael Brown now as the face of the anti-cop movement, as if cops are the problem. Just like Obama. Liberals will once again eat it up and take to the streets if the media joins in supporting her.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren, basking in the spontaneous adulation of her proposed wealth tax, prompted roars as she called on the ultra-wealthy to "pitch in 2 cents so everybody gets a chance to make it." https://t.co/8unc5xRBjf
C: (1.000%) T: I love how this article pretends that @ewarren 's plans are subtley different. No. They are meaningfully different. I don't think I could be a bigger Warren fan after this announcement. https://t.co/rPfwmRGxeK
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Doubles Down, Repeats Charlottesville Hoax Cherokee woman warren! What a joke, this woman can never bet trusted!  https://t.co/9rlaK3gZYW
C: (1.000%) T: But what if... and just go with me here, Elizabeth Warren can throw down on the dance floor
C: (1.000%) T: @tedcruz They should be checking the bank accounts of every employee at that prison, but they won't. This will go away faster than Elizabeth Warren's Indian heritage. #MiscarriageOfJustice
C: (0.988%) T: @Sansonetim @SaveTheOAToday @netflix Well I think if Elizabeth Warren ends up in the White House they'll be coughing up taxes... ;p
C: (1.000%) T: The "catch" (heh, "the deadliest catch") is in the word "needs". Who decides? Marx? Lenin? Pol Pot? Elizabeth Warren? https://t.co/79Os9hYIdt
