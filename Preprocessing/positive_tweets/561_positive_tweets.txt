C: (0.978%) T: @ewarren Today nobody asked me if Elizabeth Warren is a lying sack of dirt, because everyone already knows she is. https://t.co/aBdfPaBGQX
C: (1.000%) T: I'm looking forward to President Elizabeth Warren and her diplomatic governance not subjecting us to  hourly tweets, propaganda, and white nationalism. Can that start soon?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren  "We need fair and honest leadership" Said the person who lied to get into Harvard https://t.co/0zKzuW5gaB https://t.co/0dh9To2QZX
C: (1.000%) T: Tea leaf reading. You can play the same game by yourself and have more fun... 1/  https://t.co/B8gwT8K88q
C: (1.000%) T: @cryptoriana @slippish Me, writing a template for a press release: "today Elizabeth Warren said X" Me, hasting editting that template to go on the twitter page: "today I said X"  If it is just a product of office workers being lazy I have no choice but to defend it
C: (1.000%) T: @Linked333 @WELTHAJANE @McNeilJaden Elizabeth Warren's salary is well within the average range for a Full Professor of Law at Harvard. This is Harvard Law, where students often graduate and make more than $400k within 5 years of graduation. And no, upperclassmen do not teach classes in college ðŸ™„

C: (0.994%) T: No let up in the criticism of President Trump in the wake of the Dayton and El Paso shootings, with Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke both calling him a white supremacist.

C: (1.000%) T: @BernieSanders You're first day as President? Bernie, Elizabeth Warren has beaten you at your own game. You are done.
C: (0.990%) T: @TalbertSwan @RealOmarNavarro @realDonaldTrump Hmmm... Funny you should mention opportunistic promotion of campaigns. Do you mean like what Elizabeth Warren is doing by sending out emails requesting campaign contributions citing the tragedies in El Paso and Dayton?
C: (1.000%) T: @BrentMcCay I honestly don't think anyone would care about my little $11 a month to Elizabeth Warren. Except maybe Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI So going by your logic, anyone who supports or is a member of ANTIFA, supports socialism, Elizabeth warren and/or is a staunch liberal could also be a mass shooter since the Dayton ,Ohio shooter were those exact things.
C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker Ohio shooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren and the El Paso shooter wrote an anti-corporation (sound familiar?) manifesto and stated that Donald Trump is not to blame. Stop the rhetoric and the democratic party needs to own up to itâ€™s part in all this.
C: (1.000%) T: @theblaze Then maybe she should turn into an Indian like Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: This was a great profile. I'd be totally fine with a teacher-in-chief. https://t.co/0ooMRYfpaj
C: (0.981%) T: @loreennzzoo @TIME So, no invasion, no illegal aliens, no caravans, "they" means anything else but ms16 ? And after all, the shooter is socialist supporter of Elizabeth Warren and some bernie bro ? Nice "logic"
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren calls for $85 billion public broadband investment  https://t.co/BoPeixC4uY Like satellite internet and TV doesnâ€™t exist.
C: (0.995%) T: "Democrats might appeal to these undecided, cross-pressured voters by focusing their campaign not on Mr Trump, immigration or the politics of race, but on economics. Some candidates are already taking this path. Elizabeth Warren..." https://t.co/6GUOIq9vqp
C: (0.998%) T: @richten47 Your point was comparing Elizabeth Warren to Sarah Palin to prove that there's not sexism is refusing to vote for her.
