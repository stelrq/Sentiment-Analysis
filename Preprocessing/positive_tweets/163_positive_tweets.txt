C: (1.000%) T: @sairasameerarao Can you retweet your same clame to moslims... I asume you called them out too. Can you also add that the Dayton shooter HATED Trump and wanted to vote Elizabeth Warren. True she is also white.
C: (0.508%) T: @somasyntax @ThisWeekABC Just stay away from Elizabeth Warren rallies both of them people could be after you
C: (1.000%) T: @maggie_lang Racist? Criminal? Traitor? You are insane, and your sources of information suck. You probably don't even know that the Dayton Ohio shooter was a fan of Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, and liked the fascists of Antifa.
C: (1.000%) T: @BrentMcCay No. Donors are public record.  Elizabeth Warren’s donors are proud supporters.
C: (1.000%) T: @ifindkarma @JoaquinCastrotx @Morning_Joe Trump Jr is correct the guy posting names for someone to do something for what other reason would he post it. How come you people not blaming Elizabeth Warren for the other nut job love her she always screaming racism calling out POC
C: (0.730%) T: ARE YOU STILL A DEMOCRAT?  Dems: Dayton shooter? What Dayton shooter? That won't help us against Trump! Fuggedaboutit!  Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Bernie... https://t.co/IryksAQwr4
C: (0.556%) T: so interesting #vice Elizabeth Warren Promises to Kill State Laws That Ban Locally-Owned ISPshttp://www.vice.com/rss https://t.co/ERMLb4ij1H
C: (0.996%) T: @OutnumberedFNC Hootie Jessica Tarlof says Elizabeth Warren is the only 1 on the ascendancy Elizabeth Warren is a national joke.  Just goes to show "again", how stupid Jessica Tarlof is.
C: (1.000%) T: @sairasameerarao Dear Saira, Elizabeth Warren is one of you. I think we got a better deal.
C: (1.000%) T: https://t.co/3ZNS8fgF9Z  How many times must we repeat this to feel safe from Leftist Democrat’s who are trying to say we are the violent ones?  That’s why Dems haven’t created a better world.  They avoid responsibility for their own actions.  I do not believe that is everyone.
C: (0.999%) T: @realDonaldTrump The Dayton shooter was literally a Elizabeth Warren supporter and expressed support for antifa and other leftist organizations multiple times, yet somehow thats Trumps fault? What about the guy who just shot up an ICE facility and quoted @AOC, is that Trump fault too?
C: (1.000%) T: @PSYCH_HYPE @JoaquinCastrotx @Morning_Joe So how do u explain the Ohio shooter? He was a Bernie and Elizabeth Warren  supporter. Ya right u r a medical provider. How about shooters are criminals or insane.
C: (0.988%) T: @flyaway_k Even Elizabeth Warren doesn’t have a plan this generous. You’re my write-in vote.
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnJHarwood At the last debate Elizabeth Warren asked, I don’t know why you run for president when all you want to talk about is what you can’t do. I agree. Donald Trump has more power than I’ve ever seen a president have. I’m sure congress will go further if he wants to.
C: (1.000%) T: ~25% of rural America doesn't have broadband internet —  enter @ewarren: A blueprint of Ms. Warren’s plan envisions a “fiber infrastructure necessary to bring high-speed broadband to unserved areas, underserved areas, or areas with minimal competition.” https://t.co/gSU1k5P9HE
C: (1.000%) T: @Deena_Zaru Wonder why they don’t have blow up balloons of Elizabeth Warren since that’s who the Dayton shooter idolized?  #misfits
C: (0.999%) T: @tribelaw @JoaquinCastrotx Are you related to Elizabeth Warren?  ...Not even 1/1024?   Oh and .@JoaquinCastrotx is not right, he's left. That's what (D) means.  It means #NotRight
C: (1.000%) T: @TheRealWaitWhat @dukie38087 @jjstraka34 @TheRickWilson They've used up all strategies possible to defend Trump: video games, lack of prayer, mental illness, Elizabeth Warren, hoax of white supremacy, &amp; now, Castro.  Soon Alex Jones will suggest that the #ElPasoShooting was a hoax. Boycotts r constitutionally protected protest.
C: (0.997%) T: @DorseyFilm Sure they did.....just like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders did in Dayton....STFU
C: (1.000%) T: @terrybrozier @Haley94W @rleech2 @justbrilliant55 @steph93065 @JoaquinCastrotx As an experiment, I would challange you to wear a MAGA hat for one day and walk through a major city.  And then the next day, wear a Bernie Hat or a Elizabeth Warren T shirt.   Come back on Friday with your results.
C: (1.000%) T: @realPaulShea @Deena_Zaru Would you let Elizabeth warren visit?
C: (0.982%) T: @TozyTerry @CBSNews Once again, if Elizabeth Warren were out here dehumanizing races of people, and killers acted on her suggestions, you'd have a point. Alas, you don't. Nobody's criticizing trump because the guy was a supporter of his, it's because his motive was exactly the hate filled rhetoric
C: (1.000%) T: I just answered a call that my phone warned me was likely a scam, because it was from a Massachusetts area code and I was hoping it was Elizabeth Warren, but it was somebody wanting to talk about my electric bill.
C: (1.000%) T: @MichaelBennet Nice try, but when Elizabeth Warren is elected President I’m going to have to call you on a weekly basis to try to get you on board with universal health care.

All she did during the debates was spew hatred against Trump.  Oh, and spend our money like we print it ourselves.
