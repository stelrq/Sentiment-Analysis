C: (1.000%) T: @LauraUr23371071 @CNN He‚Äôs not my leader.. I just think Elizabeth warren would eat Beto alive one on one.
C: (1.000%) T: @DNCWarRoom @TheDemocrats Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed ‚Äúpro-Satan‚Äù views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren.  He also supported gun control....notice your silence on this issue....
C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker The Mass Shooting in Ohio was Committed by a Elizabeth Warren supporter/Democratic Socialist! You echo much of her opinions does that make you responsible for that horror? 52 People Shot in Chicago 7 Dead! White Supremacists?
C: (0.989%) T: This üëá because only @POTUS is up there on stage at his rallies nodding and laughing at the hate that is being spewed. Only @realDonaldTrump purchased 2,000+ FB ads including language like invasion and invaders. Show us @JohnCornyn where Elizabeth Warren has encouraged hate? https://t.co/icmCDW3Ws1
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Actually @iamcardib you are wrong.  The Dayton shooter is a left wing Elizabeth Warren supporter.  You really should know the truth before you spread a false narrative.  So I assume you will now condemn Ms. Warren right?
C: (1.000%) T: Hell. Yes! SO important &amp; as usual Warren always ahead of the curve with great policy &amp; great message! Thanks for the heads up @_seanikins! ‚Äú@ewarren unveiled  plan for public internet option that aims to provide universal broadband access across U.S.‚Äù https://t.co/5p0XmdgMHa
C: (1.000%) T: @raziabm @Lmchristi1 @senatemajldr @SecretService First of all what you said is not true one of the shooters was on Elizabeth Warren supporter and antifa the other person didn't like Donald Trump did not support Donald Trump he had mental issues so what is yours?
C: (1.000%) T: @Malik3G5 @m_nwwn1 @daveweigel I believe she's a kind, exceptionally smart person who genuinely cares. I understand where you are coming from, but the 2 main problems I see with Bernie (as much as I love him) are his age &amp; the antagonism amongst hardcore Clinton fans. I like them both.  https://t.co/5A0uXLCZYt
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/6QwE1T4pcI
C: (1.000%) T: If your business funds @ewarren then you are supporting hate. The Dayton shooter supported fascist terror group Antifa, socialism and Elizabeth Warren. According to Morning Joes tweet it must work both ways, right Joe?  Supporting Warren is equal to supporting fascism &amp; murder? https://t.co/PLdeMIGc3r
C: (1.000%) T: @RepDeSaulnier @KTVU Now that more info is coming out about the shooters and their love affair with socialism, Elizabeth Warren, aoc's concentration camp comments, and hatred of ICE and guns, are you gonna retract your Trump blame, or nah???
C: (0.987%) T: @Schug_Keith @ndrew_lawrence Funny that the El Paso shooter is being talked about far more than the far left Elizabeth warren supporting Dayton shooter isn‚Äôt it ? Anyone that would do that is evil.
C: (1.000%) T: @JulianCastro The Dayton shooter is a far-left progressive who supports Elizabeth Warren and Antifa. Doesn't sound like "white supremacy" to me. But I guess his leftist views don't fit your narrative.
C: (1.000%) T: @Clownboys_wife @cheche_201 @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson I guess you also know the shooter in Ohio was acting on orders from Elizabeth Warren and AOC. Leftist Antifa guy trying to make his mark.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN I challenge YOU to show me Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders promoting hate or violence towards a group of people in this country. A person could produce a mini-series with clips of you promoting hatred and violence. Do you ever actually pay attention to what you say?
C: (1.000%) T: President Elizabeth Warren! I am ready and unafraid. https://t.co/3VkI7D8Aqg
C: (0.994%) T: Pretty sure Elizabeth Warren is listening to me via my Alexa and targeting me with personal political plans.   I literally complained to Ari about this 48 hours ago. https://t.co/ctDnet3EfN
C: (1.000%) T: fave democratic candidates so far?? ‚Äî elizabeth warren is my ride or dieee but i also like julian castro, kamala is okay, i kinda like cory booker, and i‚Äôm lowkey rlly getting into andrew yang as well. also i love john hickenloope‚Ä¶ https://t.co/FEPfZWdyxu
C: (1.000%) T: @utnictex @SpursBecky @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl Than any Bernie supporter was for the Republican Congressmen that were nearly killed by a Bernie supporter. Nor are Elizabeth Warren supporters responsible for Dayton.  But the left somehow sees it okay to call out Good people who supported a legal Pres candidate.  It‚Äôs sickening
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump What about the Ohio shooter? Did Trump inspire him?  You know, the socialist, antifa supporting, Elizabeth warren supporting radical leftist?
C: (1.000%) T: @kevsaucebro Join the campaign! It‚Äôs meaningful, grassroots organizing and fun too! #Warren2020 https://t.co/meuyBUokhj
C: (1.000%) T: While slamming critics, Trump says his words 'bring people together': "I would like to stay out of the political fray," Trump said while targeting Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Beto O'Rourke,‚Ä¶ https://t.co/QTJ9Nd2Qsr #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachKavanaugh #TheResistance https://t.co/Awn6oWeahr
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are serious about revitalizing rural America. https://t.co/5Kg3tzcUes
C: (1.000%) T: @RubenG654 @SenSanders A tax on Wall st speculation would. Also, I'm in favor of cancelling debt for those making less than six figures and reducing the debt on a graduated basis for those above 100K. Elizabeth Warren alread has a plan for that
C: (0.623%) T: @EmeryvilleMatty @RepEscobar @ewarren @EmeryvilleMatty Elizabeth Warren doesn't repeat racist comments. She doesn't quote White Supremacist tweets. She isn't a racist. Trump is. Besides he was  asked not to come. This has nothing to do with fairness. This has to do with Trump's words. His hateful racist words.
