C: (1.000%) T: If we being real, Elizabeth Warren is the best candidate for the presidency but America ain’t gonna let a woman in office. Hate to see it
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Elizabeth Warren is a native American. Sort of. Not really

C: (0.990%) T: Love TV’s Frank, but it’s hard to buy @ewarren as “progressive enough” when she keeps voting year-after-year to increase the US’ gargantuan military budget.   https://t.co/ZxQWrMldln https://t.co/ki5qUvh4lK
C: (1.000%) T: @RotNScoundrel Today I asked myself if Elizabeth Warren has all the chromosomes one is supposed to have.... I said no! https://t.co/lRcVf4qFRG
C: (0.994%) T: @dixiedees50 @RobRobbEdwards No. You are an idiot if you think Joe Biden is going to save us. He won't.   Without a true progressive like Bernie or Elizabeth Warren who both do not take corporate money not much will change. The same old corporate agenda, with a nicer face maybe, will continue.

C: (1.000%) T: Connor Betts, the 24-year-old suspect in the deadly shooting in Dayton, Ohio, expressed pro-antifa, pro-socialist and anti-ICE positions on a now-suspended Twitter account believed to be his, as well as support for Democratic Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @MarkDice Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren was really It the clown. I said yes. #IsaidYes
C: (1.000%) T: @C_may93 There were 24 mass shootings during Obama’s time in office, yet no one blamed him for any of them. The shooter in Dayton was a major supporter of Elizabeth Warren but I don’t blame her for that tragedy. Don’t let hatred consume your heart. You need help.
C: (1.000%) T: @Benito35ddDavis @RepDougCollins I agree, that could be Elizabeth Warren's tribal name.
C: (0.986%) T: One of .@realDonaldTrump’s most effective advocates on-air Tue w/full-frontal assault on #Democrat Pres. candidates trying to use the weekend’s mass shootings to further their own political goals. https://t.co/8FFzWhZU6Q  #MAGA2020 #WalkAway #Warren2020 #ORourke2020 #Election2020
C: (1.000%) T: @SteveScalise An Elizabeth Warren supporter goes on a killing spree, and the next day Castro thinks this is appropriate??
C: (1.000%) T: @CNNPolitics Well why doesn’t CNN cover any of that news about the Democrat shooter who supports Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders socialism and ANTIFA?????????Why you’re a Democrat lover or a Trump hater
C: (0.999%) T: @Road_trippn @realDonaldTrump @sundarpichai Is Elizabeth Warren also responsible for her rhetoric that inspired and fueled her #Warren2020 loving, leftist Dayton shooter?
C: (1.000%) T: @tedcruz An Elizabeth Warren supporter goes on a killing spree, and the next day Castro thinks this is appropriate?
C: (0.516%) T: Crooked hillary, version 2.  I cannot believe how misguided and anti-American these folks are. Elizabeth Warren: People Who Are Hateful ‘Celebrate’ President Trump https://t.co/KjIScnZ4Fh
C: (0.994%) T: Wouldnt vote for Either for dog catcher.Surprised Warren doesn't claim she was there  https://t.co/4kT0lr71mi

C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump You cannot trust these companies because they are in the pockets of people like Elizabeth Warren who wants to “structurally change” the US government. I wonder what she means by that? 🤔
