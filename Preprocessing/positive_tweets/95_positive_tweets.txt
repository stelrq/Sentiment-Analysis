C: (1.000%) T: What do you want to bet that Epstein will NOT have an open casket? With trump and barr on the job, I wish that some people like Beto O'rourke and Elizabeth Warren would be allowed to view the body...if there is one. He's probably on his own island right now.

C: (0.988%) T: @riotwomennn @artist4ever @KamalaHarris @ewarren Elizabeth Warren agreed with Bernie Sander when he accused Hillary Clinton of rigging the Democratic Presidential Primary against him. And she trashed President Obama for earning money. She was a Bush/Reagan Republican until 1996.   Along with her NA claims. I canâ€™t  support her.
C: (0.982%) T: @AmyTan The hill is completely corporate owned. Bernie supporters hate Trump. Berners are most likely to vote Green party candidate. Many could vote for Elizabeth Warren or Tulsi Gabbard. Some would sit out.

C: (1.000%) T: @HillYes1 @MrJonCryer @USMCBRAT2 @SpeakerPelosi On the contrary, I've supported Pelosi for quite a while and was firmly on her side when she was challenged for the Speaker position, I voted for Hillary, and am 100% behind Elizabeth Warren for 2020. My issue with Speaker Pelosi is that she has shied away from stepping up ...
