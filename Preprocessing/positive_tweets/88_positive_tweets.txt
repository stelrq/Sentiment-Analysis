C: (1.000%) T: @WereUThinkin @UnitersCentrist My mom leans right and I lean left, but we both cringe equally everytime Elizabeth Warren explains that she'll FIGHT for [insert thing]. Most well-adjusted individuals are sick of fighting for fighting's sake. Fighting is necessary but nothing is achieved without cooperation.

C: (1.000%) T: @seagullsquirrel @realDonaldTrump And yet you can’t answer the questions. Why aren’t you blaming Elizabeth Warren for the #Dayton shooting?  Also please provide one piece of evidence that Trump holds racist rallies. Pretty sad that you live your life thinking half the country is racist.
C: (1.000%) T: @ClayTravis Issuing the word tribe here is offensive to people like Elizabeth Warren.  Come on bro, be 1/1024 more sensitive please.
C: (1.000%) T: @yeshua_porvida His pinned tweet is about how excited he was to meet Elizabeth Warren. I guess her white womanhood is ok??

C: (1.000%) T: @connie_nyc @petefrompitt @tedfrank @Steigerworld He's been cleared by the legal system. For you to call him a murderer is slander, Elizabeth Warren is guilty of the same thing. Your opinion is invalid. You have no legal standing here.

C: (1.000%) T: Joe Biden has that nostalgia vibe to him that is attracting a lot of older voters. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running on progressive populism which is probably more dangerous to Trump than the nostalgia.
