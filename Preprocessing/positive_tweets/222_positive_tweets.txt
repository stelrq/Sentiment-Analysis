C: (0.979%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN The shooter in Dayton did not quote Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders as the inspiration behind his horrible deed. You are a horrible person.
C: (1.000%) T: The 2nd Amendment protects the right to bear arms--not the right to bear arms that Joe Biden &amp; Elizabeth Warren say are OK.

C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ "A good education is a foundation for a better future" Elizabeth Warren  "We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came" Donald "The Racist" Trump
C: (0.983%) T: Everyone loves to talk about the El Paso shooter, because he was probably a trump supporter in a pro gun state. What about the leftist, Elizabeth Warren supporting shooter in Dayton, in a state with very strict gun laws?
C: (1.000%) T: On Monday Trump called for bipartisan cooperation to address mass shootings, but today tweeted that the Ohio gunman had 'a history of supporting political candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.'
C: (0.660%) T: @AOC Should we blame antifa and Elizabeth Warren for what happened in Ohio he was a big supporter of them. And the people of El Paso should only know that the leftist candidates are trying to raise money for themselves on the deaths of these poor people
C: (1.000%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl You planning on posting Elizabeth Warren's tops donors? Would only make sense with her connection to the Dayton shooter.

C: (0.957%) T: @Tyler_Sederwall @realDonaldTrump If the El Paso shooter is indeed Trump's fault, then the Dayton shooter is Elizabeth Warren's fault by the same logic.  I'm just saying, maybe it's not a good idea to blame people for the individual actions of others. üòï
C: (1.000%) T: Dems have been milking the El Paso tragedy for all it's political worth. Meanwhile, they &amp; media have paid little or no attention to the tragedy in Dayton. Is it because Conner Betts was a leftist, wanted socialism, supported Elizabeth Warren &amp; was a registered Democrat? You bet! https://t.co/ngi7vpKsMr
C: (0.986%) T: @JordanUhl @GoAngelo @USAA Great! Now do the Dayton shooter who was an Elizabeth Warren and progressive supporter
C: (1.000%) T: @RitaBartley7 @BetoORourke @GeorgeTakei Just like Elizabeth Warren and the date and shooter who support of her
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders don't spread hatred of immigrants, like Donald Trump.  If the political ideology is dangerous mixed with guns...  We get rid of both or just... ‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè ??? üá∫üá∏üï≥‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè
C: (0.995%) T: @upperclasstwit3 @TulsiGabbard Tulsi, Donald, and Elizabeth Warren for that matter also use a toilet.  Write a blog about it!
C: (0.581%) T: @DonaldJTrumpJr @VFL2013 @foxandfriends Lol.  Are you Indian now? Like Elizabeth Warren.... #winning
C: (0.999%) T: I had a dream that Elizabeth Warren and I became best friends and I‚Äôm sad I woke up ü•∫
C: (1.000%) T: @MikeAkers40 @JackPosobiec It‚Äôs PUBLIC INFORMATION. Stop clutching your pearls and focus on the real issues America is facing. I‚Äôm proud to say I donated to Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs campaign. Feel free to broadcast it. What‚Äôs the issue?
C: (1.000%) T: Democrats and Republicans can't let this go on. The people that pulled the triggers were followers left and right. The politicians should be calming, not inflaming things. The President did not cause this, Elizabeth Warren did not cause this. Truth and Justice. WWG1WGA https://t.co/tt6uNTQ70A
C: (1.000%) T: @ACLU Elizabeth Warren worked hard with me on preventing unlawful detention, and we have formal adjudication procedures going on for the cocaine Congress, regarding the land grab case here, involving cocaine trafficking. Anyone can call me (760) 672-2028. https://t.co/qxdhsbhRlW
C: (0.996%) T: @SenSherrodBrown The President is already doing the right thing and has been for 2 1/2 years. Democrats are the ones spewing hatred at him and his supporters (half of the country) daily. The Ohio shooter was a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Antifa radical.
C: (1.000%) T: @willtbh Weird, because #HillaryHadAPlanForThat but nobody noticed or cared. Now, when Elizabeth Warren keeps stealing her plans/ideas/platforms, tweaks them a bit and claims she came up with the plan, she‚Äôs celebrated. https://t.co/O67r3NvZ56.
C: (0.637%) T: @Cynthia34318447 @NBCNews Ah yes, Cynthia, we all know how Elizabeth Warren works up people with her inflammatory rhetoric. Oh wait, nope, that's your dude.
