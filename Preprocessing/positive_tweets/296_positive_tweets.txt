C: (0.828%) T: &amp; silence their political opponents through defamation &amp; demonization. There is a coordinated effort by the left to use these shootings to marginalize, demonize, &amp; silence the President &amp; his supporters. The DNC &amp; Elizabeth Warren are
C: (0.565%) T: @TheHarryCherry That makes me want to cry that he killed to impress Elizabeth Warren. And she hasn’t even said anything about the heinous actions of the shooter!!!  Why hasn’t she denounced the actions of that awful person in Dayton, OH???
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol None of the tycoons at the Hamptons fundraiser would send their kids to war that the neo-cons want. But now they’ve got their tax cuts and access. So they’re on board, and the country be damned. They deserve Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @michael23221047 @BresslerBetty @nini1776 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr I believe the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter! And what about the 57 people shot in Chicago this weekend? What@race were the victims? Oh, no dems care so media not reporting. Really? Crime, drugs and gangs responsible for@most of our shootings. Let’s address that

C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol @gtconway3d Elizabeth Warren is who the world needs
C: (0.990%) T: @MariaTCardona trump said these words and so did this other person so trump is certainly the guy who provoked that guy to go kill people in el paso..its a straight line, on the other hand the Dayton guy openly supports Elizabeth Warren on social networks but the police haven't
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN Queen of anti-Semitism is telling us what to believe!  I KNOW the last 2 shooter's were white radical leftists NOT white supremacists or nationalists.  They were both linked to Antifa.  One was a Satanist and was a Elizabeth Warren supporter. Wake up!  Get the facts!
C: (0.999%) T: @CNN The Dayton shooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren and was a supporter of ANTIFA so your argument doesn't hold water.

C: (0.987%) T: She usurps a culture as did Elizabeth Warren.  A problem with the truth perhaps? https://t.co/XKAUQ5Rd6E
C: (1.000%) T: @slipperyloon96 @PhilaPhans @AltNatSecAgency In the case of Dayton,  what you would expect from an Elizabeth Warren supporter...  1/1024th sanity...  in El Paso, pushed over the edge by Democrats...
C: (0.989%) T: @BillKristol We all deserve Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.990%) T: I believe #GreenShirtGuy should have a cabinet position in President Elizabeth Warren’s administration.  @ewarren, do you have a plan for that?  You’re a legend, @Alex_Kack!
C: (0.994%) T: @MaxknOws2012 @JohnMichalski16 @TheNewSocialism @NateSilver538 That's sort of what Elizabeth Warren does, no?
C: (1.000%) T: Surreal evening to say the least. Hosted Presidential Candidate and Senator, Elizabeth Warren!   Kara and I opened our home to 150 or so people to welcome hopefully our next president.  Our Highland Park/Oak Park Neighborhood came together to pull this event off beautifully. https://t.co/ohPLSiQos7

C: (0.994%) T: I doubt Yang will succeed in contesting the Far Left vote with Elizabeth Warren. He should have taken on Biden for the moderate vote https://t.co/DEhjgKF9rO
C: (1.000%) T: @TheRightMelissa @Cernovich @washingtonpost Go to her twitter and all you see is the usual leftist talking points. Desperate for a female president in her case Elizabeth Warren. Disparaging of white men. Supporter of gun control. Supporter #Metoo. And it goes on. She could not be more biased if she tried.1/2
C: (0.986%) T: @cooluser51 Why are you dissing Elizabeth Warren? She's progressive too
C: (0.952%) T: @MikeGro41282842 @Stop_Trump20 Rather than assume, ask us? I’m happy to address specific questions to build bridges of understanding. What if a Republican posted, “It’s sad that Mike Gross is fueling a campaign of hate by supporting Elizabeth Warren because she inspires Satanists to murder innocents” https://t.co/UpzdMWWJmd
