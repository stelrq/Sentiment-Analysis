C: (0.987%) T: @MarkDice @Rockprincess818 @realDonaldTrump And, a democrat who supported Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @brianstelter If the guy is a devout CNN junkie using Democrat talking points like concentration camps (AOC), and attacks on ICE/border patrol while professing his approval of Elizabeth Warren, Antifa, and domestic terrorism, yeah there's a political element. People in glass houses, you know.
C: (1.000%) T: @Natalie83049 @1idiots_opinion @CBSNews Oh bullshit. You people are pathetic. The shooter in Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren fan and supported antifa.  Elizabeth Warren has yet to say anything about the shootings in Dayton.
C: (1.000%) T: @egrette @BillKristol I love Elizabeth Warren but don't think she will attract independents - time will tell
C: (1.000%) T: @thewillpierce We need him to win. If not him Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr So if Trump owns white supremacy, I guess you own it too? This guy was a “Warren supporter” &amp; killed several black people along with his sister.   https://t.co/x7MYQH5xvV
C: (1.000%) T: @DineshDSouza Is it just me, or is Elizabeth Warren starting to look more and more like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons? https://t.co/zI8oOq6lwv
C: (0.736%) T: @AnnCoulter How could any policemen or law enforcement person vote for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.933%) T: Who are you going to trust going forward: a serial liar and cheat who won't even disclose his tax returns, or someone like @ewarren who is running for the office and says, 'no president is above the law'?   Donald Trump is a serial cheat and Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that. https://t.co/pL5K1VDngO

C: (1.000%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI Even though the mass Shooters always turn out to be crazy Lefty Looney liberal types that are antifa and support Elizabeth Warren and are Trump haters? You are an absolute fucking idiot. It's always the left that goes on the shooting sprees.

C: (1.000%) T: @braak Unregulated capitalism is bad. People are bad. Greed is bad. Power corrupts in any economic system. If I were a captain of industry, I’d be secretly working to elect Elizabeth Warren, cuz if we don’t get some reasonable regulations on capitalism, the guillotines are up in 5 years
C: (1.000%) T: @PelosiSquadFive @ewarren Oh please where was Elizabeth Warren 5 years ago when Michael Brown was killed? I know where Hillary Clinton was and what she said about it and the personal calls she made to Michael Brown’s Mother.
C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren's, and how racist 4 U to keep calling whites white supremacists, if you said that San Bernardino and Orlando shooters were radical Muslims there  would be outrage! This is why you're fake news and no one can trust you anymore! https://t.co/Hqzpcgh72A
