C: (0.989%) T: Elizabeth Warren's awkward attempt to connect with an Iowa farmer launches hilarious new meme https://t.co/RZv4BVO4sh via @BIZPACReview
C: (1.000%) T: @BetteMidler I guess you missed that the Dayton shooter was a far-left, Elizabeth Warren voter who supported antifa and wanted socialism right?
C: (0.983%) T: Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a useless race baiter. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @TheProductDS I personally like Elizabeth Warren, because she‚Äôs the first ever candidate to acknowledge non-binary gender identities but Bernie‚Äôs a close second.
C: (1.000%) T: @PCBearcat @jermman2085 @KMacalicious @KimNorvellDMR Huh? I have no doubt that Elizabeth Warren has bought lemonade from children before, or that she did so today.  I just don't believe that the person paid to cover her accidentally saw it happen in the 45 seconds it took to pour 7 glasses of lemonade and hand over a $10 bill.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren will say anything to get elected, even if she knows it's not true. I said yes.  Same for Bernie. Pete. Kamala. Joe. Should I continue?
C: (0.999%) T: @nberlat @JackDexterity @GarrettShorr @BrianSwiftie13 @BernieSanders Actually, this is untrue. Bernie Sanders has a very high favorability rating with people of color. Perhaps you're looking at old data. In fact, Bernie pulls higher with people of color then Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.999%) T: @RepAdamSchiff Really. You are silent with killings every week in Chicago. In fact two mothers patrolling their block were gunned down 2 weeks ago and you said nothing. Ohio shooter supported Elizabeth Warren. Your a hypocrite
C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren He as much white supremacist as Elizabeth Warren is Indian. Zero.
C: (1.000%) T: Meanwhile Elizabeth Warren did the right thing and doubled down on calling Trump a 'white supremacist' https://t.co/cOZddexkUM
C: (0.999%) T: Elizabeth Warren has gotten so bad, she can't even fake buying a cup of lemonade now!? https://t.co/TIrPdBP1gm
C: (0.997%) T: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wants America to pay for all these college kids it‚Äôs not our responsibility the Democrats have no right to steal our money to pay off student loans for people that we don‚Äôt even know such bullshit
C: (0.999%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren is a pathological liar and not only is she not an Indian she is a compulsive liar who has no idea what's happening in the world around her Mark R Levin sometimes the truth hurts and when she wakes up and realizes the reality of her life maybe she'll quit politics
C: (0.988%) T: @RWwatchMA @MSNBC And the Dayton shooter echos the words from antifa and Elizabeth Warren and the Democrat party. This is why #morningJoe and the media incessantly went on about El Paso while simultaneously ignoring Dayton. Wake up.  https://t.co/an5Gk6ye1A
C: (1.000%) T: Pinnochiohontas ü§•ü§•won‚Äôt retract stmt that Brown was murdered, even though eye witness accounts led to report  that Wilson ‚Äúdid not act with the requisite criminal intent‚Äù &amp; eye witnesses, fearing for their lives, spoke out! #Racebaiters https://t.co/vNEFKRV0Xw
C: (1.000%) T: @bongino @TheRightMelissa What a horrible thing to say!   Look at clinton,  Elizabeth Warren?  Now these are some sick women and Harris she wasn‚Äôt born with a brain, class, Couth?
C: (0.988%) T: @MarkYoungTruth @DavidIanRobin BERNIE SANDERS &amp; ELIZABETH WARREN(BOTH FAR-LEFT SOCIALIST/COMMUNIST) BELIEVE THAT AMERICAN WOMEN NEED TO BE RAPED!  "THESE IDIOTS ARE DISGUSTING PERVERTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE IN OUR GOVERNMENT MAKING LAWS" https://t.co/XdWxULCUJA
C: (0.988%) T: Despicable but not surprising. https://t.co/GnY9CmhExa
C: (1.000%) T: Correct! My vote is either gonna be for Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren! Just because the candidate is a minority doesn‚Äôt mean they have our best interest at heart!!! https://t.co/LUpHM5nJ8f
C: (1.000%) T: I'll support whatever democratic nominee y'all pick. But PLEASE don't make it Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.693%) T: @MichaelAvenatti @ChrisCuomo Social Media never spoke without an input from a human, say Maxine Waters or Corey Booker or Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: A #trump weakness is his relatively narrow experience of living in clubs, towers, other protected spaces--a strength of @ewarren is that she likes the people, gets out there and meets the people, leads for ALL the people, not just a wealthy few. Lead Ahead with Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Imagine @ewarren Lead Ahead with Elizabeth Warren filmed on urban sidewalks, National Parks, seashore, senior centers, schools, libraries--places where she talks to American people to inspire, teach, lead daily w/well-known and lesser known supporters. I'd tune in daily.
C: (0.993%) T: As 2020 race heats up, growing worries Warren and Sanders will split leftist vote: At rallies at the Iowa State Fair last week, 2020 White House contenders Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders drew raucous‚Ä¶ https://t.co/maCWRJ3npd #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachKavanaugh #TheResistance https://t.co/S3rDcyFSHF
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnathanRoyale @ChiTownSam723 That Bernie always tries to play the victim and it won‚Äôt work this time. That‚Äôs why he is being trounced by Elizabeth Warren. I didn‚Äôt stutter.
