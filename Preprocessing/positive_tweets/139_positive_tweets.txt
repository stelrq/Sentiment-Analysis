C: (0.952%) T: @SamEllison11 @YancyFaith @CSojourner @realDonaldTrump By your logic, should we classify all Democrats as Satanists because one was a Democrat and liked Elizabeth Warren or classify AOC, Bernie,  Climate Change proponents as EcoTerrorists and blame all of them for the violence? https://t.co/QCMUPUpfpu
C: (1.000%) T: There's something so innately comforting about Elizabeth Warren's voice. It's like your favorite high school teacher and your mom's BFF all rolled into one.

C: (1.000%) T: @MarysGotClass @ShuLordMomma @EdwardTHardy @RepEscobar Turns out the Ohio shooter was a big fan of left wing politics and Elizabeth Warren for president. I’m guessing she doesn’t have to prove anything though right? Or AOC after the attempted ice bombing, or Bernie after Congress ballgame shooting. Only Trump gets accused of this BS
C: (1.000%) T: @SenWarren  Elizabeth Warren is a serious candidate willing to make deep dives into policy and to lead. How grotesque that she is met with buffoonery. She seems ready to stand up and support her fellow Americans; we should reciprocate.
