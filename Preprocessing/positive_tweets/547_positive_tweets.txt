C: (1.000%) T: @SteveEsker @politico Your choice.  Just genuinely interested.  Didn‚Äôt blame Obama. Don‚Äôt blame Elizabeth Warren. Just don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs okay for one and not the other. If everyone was even across the board I‚Äôm good with it
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren had ever lied about being an Indian to get into college. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @SenSanders Not a crisis is it?One of you moron compadres (Elizabeth Warren) is proposing forgiving that debt!Just imagine how many votes that will buy her?Sounds easy-print more money &amp; the value of the dollars I worked hard to save will plummet!  I paid off my debts but I get screwed!  FU!
C: (0.870%) T: Why isnt anyone blaming the Dayton shooter who believed in Socialism on Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. We hear all the El Paso blame going to Trump. Does no one understand that we r responsible for our own actions! Own ur mistakes @ewarren @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump
C: (1.000%) T: Its time for people to understand. Elizabeth Warren is not a progressive. She is faking it. She never enters into anything unless it‚Äôs politically safe. Real courage would have had her endorse Bernie 2016.She never once called for imprisonment, for any bankers or Wall St. crooks. https://t.co/cM8SWzgqZn
C: (0.998%) T: @tariqnasheed This is a horrible tweet. The Ohio shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren. This dumb nut was probably a fan of John Wick. Will John Wick have to apologize? You are trying to silence these conservatives by creating an  association to this guy.
C: (1.000%) T: @mcgrimus @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS It‚Äôs sad when people only ever see the worst, he is smiling because the baby is alive and well. The rampant hatred on both sides serves no one. Trump is no more responsible for El Paso than Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Just Happen ... another reason why people call out Fake News .. your Bio states you cover Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked whether Elizabeth Warren is an American Indian supremacist. I said yes.

C: (0.996%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren: "Nobody can be part of the 21st century economy unless you've got access to high speed internet." https://t.co/DXHJGJJlIx
C: (1.000%) T: The only candidate I can imagine overtaking Joe Biden is Elizabeth Warren. In my mind it‚Äôs a two person race.
C: (1.000%) T: @dukie38087 @anniekarni @katierogers But hey go ahead and expose all the Elizabeth Warren donors if it makes you happy. I already volunteer I am one
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a man, I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren And for decades when anyone asked you if you were a Native American you‚Äôd also say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.   An intelligent person would reach the conclusion that there is no lie so absurd that Elizabeth Warren will not spread for her own political gain.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Yeah, Elizabeth Warren - known race appropriator and speaker of the truth. üôÑ #DemocratsThinkYoureStupid
C: (0.998%) T: @FunnellMike @MatthewBevan Joe Biden obviously has dementia and he is facing Donald Trump who is obviously crazy they need another choice say Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @hrenee80 Then on the other hand you have Biden and the smells of Indians and poor kids are as smart as white kids....etc. Elizabeth Warren n lying about heritage screwing a qualified minority out of standing and positions.
C: (1.000%) T: Can we just make Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris President now...   Joe Biden says 'poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids' on the campaign trail  https://t.co/4T05pNCg9W
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a menace to society &amp; would sell her soul for a vote.
C: (1.000%) T: Joe barton obviously has dementia and he is facing Whiskers the cat who is obviously crazy they need another choice say elizabeth warren
C: (1.000%) T: Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was Native American.  I said no.  This is fun and easy! https://t.co/FR549ygwMS
