C: (1.000%) T: @pbfrsox @thejaninegranda @jrockg8000 @JET101684 @HeatherLewisTV The best thing would be to get those people help, and try to figure out their anger. Let's be honest Trump didn't tell the El Paso terrorist to kill people that day, and Elizabeth Warren didnt tell the Dayton terrorist to kill people.

C: (1.000%) T: @claremccann i have all the sympathy in the world for scammed for-profit college borrowers and think they should get generous relief. i think elizabeth warren is awesome. But I do wonder why we're talking about college grads so much and not, say, people living in decrepit public housing.
C: (1.000%) T: Some good info about Warren's "electability" (üòí) here. Key takeaways: 1. She does about AS well as JB with your faves‚Äîthe white peepo in diners in Wisconsin.  2. She does a better job of getting Democrats excited to vote for her. That matters.  https://t.co/WMi4wnySvv

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @ewarren crazy, hate-filled biased attacks directed at America's President &amp; every American who voted for him is Irrational unhinged, insane!  Apply #RedFlagLaw to Elizabeth Warren.   Never allow her near weapons.  This disqualifies her for President! NO #Warren2020
C: (1.000%) T: @themaxburns @davidmweissman @shaunking @benshapiro There you libs go again. Pointing fingers at people instead of the trigger happy nutjob. Now, since we know the Dayton shooter was Antifa, we ready to condemn those terrorist also? Are we pointing fingers at Elizabeth Warren?

C: (0.977%) T: Last South Carolina poll had Elizabeth Warren at 2% with Black voters. Likely similar throughout the south and thus I‚Äôm very bearish on her odds to be the nominee https://t.co/gPx9cZSEgl
C: (1.000%) T: @bearsalldaylong @peterdaou Here are two examples of that being incorrect. Also, once the official candidate is named, people will rally around that one name. This isn't a complex thing to unwrap.  https://t.co/VJyPQS4hI8  https://t.co/DGN7Z1bNtu
