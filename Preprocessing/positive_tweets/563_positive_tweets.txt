C: (1.000%) T: @RepKarenBass As one of the more respected Congresswomen I‚Äôm shocked &amp; saddened to see you stoop so law. Why are you letting @AOC @ewarren @SenWarren &amp; @SenSanders @BernieSanders off the hook so easily? https://t.co/e8wGETAHIV
C: (0.999%) T: @g_sk_one @wandermom @karenmulter @PeteButtigieg @PaulObrienUSA The El Paso shooter espoused left-wing environmental views, including thoughts about the importance of population control. Try again. PS - The Dayton shooter was a full-on, all-out Antifa leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @JessicaTarlov @MZHemingway Funny no mention of the progressive extremist. What is he? No label for him? He followed Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The El Paso shooter was an environmental extremist as well. Now THAT doesn't sound like the alt right at all. A terrorist is a terrorist you puke heads.
C: (0.711%) T: Remember when Sonia and I met years ago as first year College Dems and never could have dreamed of both working for future President Elizabeth Warren from different states?  Yes, I‚Äôm crying that‚Äôs not sweat. https://t.co/wOz03NS1n3
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @jimserra You do realize the shooter held a convoluted ideology that mostly included Socialists, environmentalists, nazism, population control, and was leaning to vote for Elizabeth Warren. So, he was more like one of your people than a Trump supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @DebraMessing @laurenwerner Not anymore, you are losing.  I cant wait watch the videos of crying super leftists like you when Elizabeth Warren loses the popular vote and electoral vote.  Its seriously funny how you dont understand America.

C: (1.000%) T: @ndrew_lawrence Prep-school demagogue says mentioning white supremacy is designed to distract honest, Real Americans‚Ñ¢ from noticing the class divide?! You must think your audience fools.  Four words, @TuckerCarlson : Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @TrumperSeaney @my3monkees @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump GREAT IDEA! And can we send the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren socialists to live there? üôèüèª

C: (0.996%) T: @SmurfAccount654 @rolltide_gofins @KSTiLLS @schadjoe Got it so Bernie Sanders is to blame for Steve Scalise being shot and Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooting and AOC for the ICE headquarters being almost shot up by Antifa.  Glad to know how dumbasses like you think.
C: (1.000%) T: @whyulying10 @AlAddictSupport @AdrianNormanDC @whyulying Well, the next time a "leftist" shoots up a room full of people while wearing an Elizabeth Warren hat, we can talk.
C: (0.997%) T: Today has literally been a whole saga of me realizing just how in debt I‚Äôm gonna have to go for grad school and almost crying while clutching my Elizabeth Warren action figure and praying she becomes president and erases the 130,000 debt law school is gonna put me in tee hee :)

C: (1.000%) T: @lifter_brandi @molly649 @carrieksada @BreitbartNews A very bad one. The same idiots touting gun control the loudest likely have an arsenal larger than most deplorables dream of. After all, weren‚Äôt both mass shootings committed by libs this past week? ü§î Yep. Elizabeth Warren supporter in OH and admitted progressive in TX.
C: (0.994%) T: @Neolibshilling @sooze555 @kenolin1 @HillaryClinton Now find me a quote where Elizabeth Warren contradicts herself.
