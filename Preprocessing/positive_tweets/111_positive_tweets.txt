C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris This is an outright Lie! It's people like you who keep racism alive. Disgraceful! https://t.co/TaLGJBysha
C: (1.000%) T: @exavierpope How about Elizabeth Warren supporters? No matter, all the same. The question is, why are you only concerned with 5% of gun homicides? 95% of them occur with handguns so maybe you should be less selectively outraged.

C: (1.000%) T: @RealMattCouch Are you kidding? Ahhh yes! Anyone is better than Trump and his saying one thing one day, and a reversal the next day. And insulting leaders or in love with leaders the next day. Elizabeth Warren is a lawyer and a Professor. Educated, Intelligent&amp;Motivated.
C: (0.513%) T: Not that I was considering voting for either, but this is disqualifying-  On Ferguson, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris Told a Terrible Lie https://t.co/fGyeHlAd2m

C: (1.000%) T: @agehrt1 @douglas80_phil @sairasameerarao She doesn't sound any different than Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. All D's seem quite eager to exploit racial fault lines in a particular direction.  https://t.co/1OopTp4SMT  https://t.co/asWzefTlAZ
C: (0.984%) T: And here‚Äôs some stranger who has dropped into my feed to remind me that no, Elizabeth Warren really, really is part Native American. EJECT. At 6 pm? That‚Äôs showing up at my Twitter party with a bottle of Cold Duck, FoH
C: (0.997%) T: @hazechu @EireFreeSpeech @EbunJoseph1 @sandra_ruizSD @SocDems @TBuczkowska Travellers themselves would dispute it, and they'd be right. Like when US politician Elizabeth Warren pretended to have Native American ethnicity in order to have a minority status. Or "activist" Shaun King pretending to be black to get that Oprah Winfrey scholarship.
C: (0.982%) T: @psalms_11_3 NH has some problems with Hispanic immigrants in Nashua, Derry, and Manchester, but is otherwise lily-white and doesn't seem to be attracting the Elizabeth Warren types anywhere near as quickly as southern Maine is.  And unlike northern Maine, it actually has an economy.
C: (1.000%) T: @CJR credit to @germanrlopez of Vox for writing this up -- intellectual honesty over press-pack silence on something like this ain't fun https://t.co/qI3p3XESbz
C: (1.000%) T: @seanhannity How about we fix the college fraud instead.   No way these "Professors" Like Elizabeth Warren (and the Deans!) are worth the kind of money they get.   What a scam.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is literally the worst democratic candidate possible. I like  Tulsi Gabbard and Kamala Harris a lot too and DeBlasio is decent
C: (0.987%) T: Psst! You Can‚Äôt Turn Straw Into Gold (and other fun stories)  ‚Äî‚Äî  Open Letter to Elizabeth Warren et al.  https://t.co/GMlnSkSLay
C: (1.000%) T: anyway this twitter thread was sparked by that #myberniestory hashtag that's been trending all day. most of the stories has been about the idea of wiping out student debt.   i prefer elizabeth warren's approach, its economically sustainable
C: (1.000%) T: @BurgSkeletal @peterdaou You crazy? Elizabeth Warren. She makes obvious tactical blunders constantly.
C: (1.000%) T: @BethanyBeeches @washingtonpost A quick google search shows that the Dayton shooter was a left wing radical who adored Antifa and Elizabeth Warren.  Facts don‚Äôt always fit your narrative.
C: (0.986%) T: @ewarren  Republicans you have to get over the fact that Elizabeth Warren does have Native American blood is she member the Cherokee tribe who knows everybody from Oklahoma claims to be Cherokee.
C: (0.991%) T: @keethers I guess you forgot that when #Bernie didn't get the Democratic Nomination, he accused Hillary of cheating, and the only person who backed his üêÇüí© claim was ELIZABETH WARREN.  She is just as much a PUTIN PUPPET as #Bernie is.  Swapping one PUTIN PUPPET for another isn't PROGRESS.
C: (1.000%) T: Do the Dems really need to continue the whole primary farce? I've seen the future and Joe Biden wins the nomination to serve as a figurehead, with Elizabeth Warren as the corporate sell-out with just enough leftist cred to do a better job than Hillary at "leftist populism."
C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren implored Walmart to "do the right thing ‚Äî stop selling guns," in response to the El Paso shooting: "Companies that sell guns have a responsibility to the safety of their communities." https://t.co/AzP2HG55XB via @HuffPostPol  Warren standing up for Americans
C: (0.995%) T: Elizabeth Warren can rise above anyone. And should. https://t.co/N1THPirPkM
C: (1.000%) T: @WalkerBragman I am 100% a supporter of Elizabeth Warren in 2020. I want her to be the next POTUS. Bashing Biden is not the way to accomplish that and simply weakens the D‚Äôs if he is the nominee. This is too important. Pro Warren comments? YES! ALL DAY! Anti Biden comments? NO. Stop it. Now.
C: (1.000%) T: The answer should have been no.  Just as the answer to ; is Elizabeth Warren a native American ...... NO https://t.co/RigzRPPQ9P
