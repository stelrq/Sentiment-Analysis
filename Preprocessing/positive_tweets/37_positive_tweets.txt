C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Could you attach the evidence of him liking Elizabeth Warren? Who said that? What or who is the source? Names, who are they?
C: (1.000%) T: @CatsAreGods @shortalbino Warren knew full well the DNC was rigging the '16 primary and did nothing about it. Tulsi Gabbard resigned her position w/ the DNC due to this rigging. https://t.co/4tNJkDCplp
C: (0.788%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl You are sick and should be banned for doxxing people.  They are now targets of violent attacks like the 2 Democrats committed last weekend  Elizabeth Warren supporters are violent

C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúShe did not condescend to her readers or her friends; she was utterly confident of her own capacity and of ours.‚Äù This reminds me of Elizabeth Warren as portrayed by @rtraister (and as I experienced her in Chicago). Rest In Power Prof Morrison https://t.co/dYMOjDBNRS
C: (0.954%) T: "Elizabeth Warren is a fake progressive because *screeching noises*
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol That‚Äôs the thing about Elizabeth Warren, though. We *all* deserve her. She would be as good for everyday Americans as she would be bad for shady plutocrats.

C: (1.000%) T: @seanhannity I'd happily be outed as a Castro donor.   In fact I'll let you in on another non secret I've donated to President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren and was happy to do so.  Why are Trump supporters so ashamed of their support? ü§îü§î
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris Like you care, lady.  You did so much shady shit as a prosecutor and now you‚Äôre playing all innocent about it.  You are a horrible person.  You don‚Äôt deserve any respect.  Even Elizabeth Warren that corporatist shill is better than you‚Äôll ever be!
C: (1.000%) T: The voting public should start considering whether or not Elizabeth Warren (among others) is suffering some sort of mental illness. She appears to really believe her delusions, which is a characteristic of mental illness. OR she's a great actor promoting lies and understands that https://t.co/DrypFyhf9p
C: (0.988%) T: Sometimes I imagine Elizabeth Warren has a plan factory
C: (0.982%) T: Yes. Oh my God yes.  https://t.co/wzyiVkVG7X
C: (1.000%) T: You just don't get it!  It's not about who the shooters supported. It's about a politician's actions which ignited the flames. You loaded the GUNS with your racist words and actions. Elizabeth Warren &amp; others did not.  You need to APOLOGISE!  @realDonaldTrump A real leader would https://t.co/Br1H1pS7X3 https://t.co/MNzwJGQiFn
C: (1.000%) T: So while we, as Labour supporters, look at Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and think "what is there to disagree with here? It's just common sense!", we ignore the south and the mid-west. We also ignore that Hillary's base was invariably among latter-day Jacksonian Democrats.
C: (1.000%) T: @MaryWills612 @thehill I'm pretty sure one of the mass shooter was a Bernie and Elizabeth Warren supporter
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren proposes 'public option for broadband' https://t.co/F3VXmF5cx0
C: (0.997%) T: @seantbrown87 @billwowdotcom That is why I am saying that his motive is confusing. If he was truly an Elizabeth Warren supporter, this is not what he would have chosen. Senator Warren does not speak in any sort of hateful rhetoric like Trump does.
C: (0.995%) T: Elizabeth Warren's universal childcare plan will help everyone, most of all poor and working-class families.  https://t.co/71WJBF7EgA
