C: (1.000%) T: @johnmbusher @FDRLST @OpenSecretsDC Let's have Trump choose 44 Elizabeth Warren donors and post their personal info on twitter. See how that goes over.
C: (1.000%) T: @Mr_JHowes @TwitterMoments @TuckerCarlson Pretty much anything you hear about race comes from liberals. Look at Marianne Williamson, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders‚Äîthey all ascribe to the notion that your race dictates your status in life.  Also, I don‚Äôt know where you got racial profiling from.
C: (0.999%) T: @AnastasiaFennec @dagreatscienski @Mark_Penn Incredible logic there, Anastasia.  By your logic Obama was responsible for the police killed in Dallas. He was a fascist.  Bernie is responsible for the baseball field shooting. Fascist.  Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton. Fascist.  And AOC is responsible for Portland.
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Because Elizabeth Warren doesn't call brown people, infections, rapists and gang members. She didn't laugh when at a rally someone suggested Mexicans should be shot. And because a white nationalist mass-murdering terrorists didn't quote her words in his manifesto. Just a theory.

C: (0.983%) T: @robreiner What about the Elizabeth Warren supporter ultra-leftist Dayton shooter? You seem to be ignoring this violent leftist mass shooter...
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis And given this stupid logic, since the Dayton shooter is a Elizabeth Warren supporter, that one lies at her feet? Is there a democrat alive that believes in personal responsibility? Give it a break.
C: (0.995%) T: @ABC It was Elizabeth Warren supporter that committed just act of violence, why are you not addressing Elizabeth Warren for this person‚Äôs actions
C: (1.000%) T: @Arthur_SLM @ewarren That's better.  I like new stuff like this.  It's a reflection of your stupidity in every way.  Keep them coming, I'll let Elizabeth Warren know how much you love her &amp; how you are preoccupied with her every day.

C: (0.995%) T: @KamalaHarris Why have you Democrat‚Äôs abandoned the Dayton shooting that happenedwithin 24 hours. Is it because he was a socialist, Elizabeth Warren supporter, hated Trump, and supported transgender rights included his sisters transition. Sounded like a modern progressive to me.
C: (1.000%) T: @GovHowardDean Moderate to progressive. I‚Äôm supporting Elizabeth Warren for #POTUS
