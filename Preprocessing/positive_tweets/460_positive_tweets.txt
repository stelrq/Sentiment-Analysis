C: (1.000%) T: @AStratelates @ewarren Elizabeth Warren: Yesterday I was asked if I was Native American. I said yes.  EW: Today I asked if I would wrestle in cherry Jello w/ @KamalaHarris  &amp; @AOC - I said yes.  EW: Tomorrow I will promise a YES to another whopper question. With 8% chance of being correct.

C: (0.980%) T: @JoeBiden Joe, have you charged Elizabeth Warren with the Dayton shooting, he supported her. And when will Bernie be shut down, he had the ball field shooter.  Get real old man.  You are a liar and a criminal by not calling them out.  #UnfitJoe
C: (1.000%) T: But it was Team Warren that was consistently the loudest of the bunch, and arguably most creative with the chants. A sample: ‚ÄúE-L-I-Z She‚Äôs got a plan for me.‚Äù ‚ÄúBig. Structural. Change.‚Äù ‚ÄúI-O-W-A Elizabeth Warren all the way.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am a Warren Democrat.‚Äù

C: (1.000%) T: It's encouraging to see digital inclusion as a campaign issue for one of the major nominees.  A staggering 1.5 million Bay Area residents (20%) don't have home broadband Internet.  Unacceptable. https://t.co/2U9WdqYBau

C: (0.987%) T: @AOC gilroy iranian, el paso half hispanic and your supporter. Dayton satanist and a elizabeth warren supporter. 59% of mass shooters are black. but most are democrat. why...... because you're a liar.
C: (0.999%) T: @RadioGuyChris @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Hey, Scowly McSour-puss (aka Huckasands), like Trump, there are hours &amp; hours of speeches, addresses &amp; appearances by Elizabeth Warren. Find me the one where she excuses or encourages violence against her enemies and MAYBE, I'll buy your argument.
C: (0.997%) T: @Ferral_Carol @LadyPLS24 @Alyssa_Milano @BetoORourke @TennesseeKitKat I like him and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.995%) T: @Tra777 @TheDotP So why are Republicans blaming the Dayton shooter and saying he was Elizabeth Warren supporter and say ‚Äú SEE LEFT WING SHOOTERS‚Äù
C: (1.000%) T: @HeartsOwls And how was that? I pointed out that the Dayton shooter was a fan of Elizabeth Warren (and Bernie Sanders and Socialism).
C: (1.000%) T: @KellyScaletta #Yeehawdi members secretly love that the minorities are killing each other, the same way they loved the Toledo shooting because the shooter (maybe) followed Elizabeth Warren on Twitter.   Since we are in the dumbest timeline, I am aware it was Dayton, not Toledo like Trump said.
C: (1.000%) T: The DNA samples from Indigenous people from Mexico and South America were used to compare Elizabeth Warren's DNA. There is no DNA test for Native American ancestry! The DNA testing companies can't use DNA samples from the Native American tribes in the United States. #Genetics
