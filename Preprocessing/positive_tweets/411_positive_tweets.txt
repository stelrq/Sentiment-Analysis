C: (0.990%) T: Dayton shooter was 'exploring violent ideologies,' investigators say https://t.co/948Jv3sfJA #FoxNews his hero is elizabeth warren..
C: (0.962%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ This is a despicable comment. Please cite one time that Elizabeth Warren has called for hate and racism to reign. Please cite evidence that the Dayton shooter was motivated by anything that Elizabeth Warren said. You are a United States senator. Shame on you.
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC Number one cable show in America in time slot sets the country straight.  Let's talk about DAYTON, The nut was a huge Left wing crazy... And would vote for  Elizabeth Warren... Antifa,  A Left terrorist group the democrats never confront https://t.co/oAA9WcCN7B
C: (0.998%) T: @Herbert_L_Reed @SenKamalaHarris @SenBooker Kamala Harris is done. And thanks to the Dayton shooter, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders also might be done.  It looks like 2020 will be the battle of the rich old white guys.   #Trump2020 #MAGA #KAG
C: (0.999%) T: @JoeNBC What a disgusting lie. Trump is not a white supremacist and the Dayton shooter was a leftist fan of Elizabeth Warren. You need to find another job, because you're a disgrace to journalism.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepAdamSchiff What about the 59 shot and 7 killed in Chicago this weekend? Oh that‚Äôs right it doesn‚Äôt fit the lefts narrative. The Dayton shooter was a liberal who supported Elizabeth Warren!
C: (1.000%) T: @MsNerdyNurse Yea I‚Äôm sure that trump had a lot to do with the Elizabeth Warren supporting Antifa nut that shot up dayton, the one that was already known to authorities.

C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Clearly you missed that one of the shooters was a huge supporter of Elizabeth Warren and not the president. Did you know there was another mass shooting in Illinois this week? 35 shot and 4 killed. Ooops...n/m...just another week in democrat run chicago: https://t.co/xKpS3MtD6d
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúThere is a divide between some of my older colleagues and myself in regards to who we want to see elected and become president,‚Äù Garvin said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think that is a divide that Elizabeth Warren can‚Äôt overcome.‚Äù

C: (1.000%) T: @SharronSmiley @MichaelCoudrey Actually, it is. Reported by the New York Post again today. They didn‚Äôt scrub fast enough and the truth about the fact the Ohio shooter was a Liberal and an Antifa and Elizabeth Warren fan. All that Antifa violence and rhetoric is spreading hate and violence.

C: (0.994%) T: @bamagirl4464 The news media will soon move on from the El Paso shooting. The media has already ignored the Dayton shooting because the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúWhen the process started a couple of months ago, Elizabeth Warren was not even on my list of candidates that I was intending to support,‚Äù he said.
C: (0.983%) T: @rezaaslan So is Elizabeth Warren and everyone who follows her responsible for the Ohio terrorist?
C: (0.598%) T: @JeremyDBoreing @benshapiro Imagine being as dumb as Elizabeth Warren and genuinely not realizing that your white ass single-handedly insulted every Native American with your own horse crap and then blamed Donald for white supremacy.
C: (0.770%) T: @iamcardib He was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and hated Trump. Get it right!
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Your right facts matter. We have enough info already THe Ohio shooter was a leftist Elizabeth Warren supporter and hated Trump. What are YOU going to do to control some of your hate filled Democratic dividers They are sewing racism
C: (0.986%) T: @paulsperry_ The shooter attacked the power of corporations throughout his manifesto, parroting word for word how Elizabeth Warren attacks them.
C: (1.000%) T: @RepJerryNadler The Dayton, Ohio, shooter identified as a ‚Äúleftist,‚Äù according to his Twitter profile.   His account tweeted in support of socialism, against the election of President Donald Trump, and in favor of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) for president in 2020. https://t.co/wpdFuaFAfN
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN What do we do about liberal Elizabeth Warren supporters (although I suppose that, in itself, would qualify as mental illness), like the Dayton killer?
