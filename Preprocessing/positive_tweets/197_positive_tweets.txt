C: (1.000%) T: @RichardVeii @mgssnr My grandmother always said “If you lie about the small things, you’ll lie about the big things”.  Pretty much sums up Elizabeth Warren for me.

C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 You people make it so easy to point out how dumb you are.  Did Elizabeth Warren tell him the victims of his hate were his enemies, or invading his country?
