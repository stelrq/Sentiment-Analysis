C: (1.000%) T: @davidmweissman @HillaryClinton I doubt you were ever a Trump supporter, much less voted for him. And Elizabeth Warren? She has about as much chance of becoming President as you do of believable.
C: (1.000%) T: @alexi That's ridiculous. The Ohio mass shooter supported and spewed hateful rhetoric from AOC, Elizabeth Warren, Antifa and Bernie Sanders. Also sounded very much like .@JulianCastro. So, obviously Castro responsible for deaths in Ohio shooting?
C: (1.000%) T: BREAKING: Elizabeth Warren was asked why she calls Trump a "white supremacist"  SHE SAID THIS   "You know, when the white supremacists call Donald Trump one of their own I tend to believe them."
C: (1.000%) T: @GayRepublicSwag Uh oh...I've already called Elizabeth Warren a loser this morning.  I'll try again tomorrow.  You are a very kind soul.
C: (1.000%) T: @RavMABAY @LaurenOrder2020 @pmccre @WilesWj @ShirleyMortens3 @IsaacDovere Excluding Warren, because she's alright, just disappointing she held out doing 2016 in an attempt to get the VP from the Clinton Campaign. Let's examine some of the stuff these folks "got done" shall we?  https://t.co/6yG3cJRxCg
C: (1.000%) T: @BillieSSmith Oh know.. I love Elizabeth Warren.. She fantastic.. I would love for her to be President in 2021.  Yes
C: (0.995%) T: As if I need more reasons to stan Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/yxeyBYj9tL
C: (1.000%) T: @DineshDSouza Has anyone ever seen trump doing any of this? Trump lived in an ivory tower for his whole life and knows nothing about being normal or normal people!  Elizabeth Warren knows the struggle and has consistently advocated for average Americans her whole time in office!
C: (1.000%) T: @RebelBlue36 Oh, god!!! I thought you were talking about the post I did on Elizabeth Warren. Sorry
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery and people want to use this picture of elizabeth warren as a form of birth control.
C: (1.000%) T: @markzbarabak @melmason is that because one of the mass Shooters recently was a Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders supporter and you want to be like him.
C: (1.000%) T: .@GlennKesslerWP's fact check of Kamala Harris' and Elizabeth Warren's lies about Ferguson is devastating in its clinical efficiency. It's a thorough, methodical debunking and dismantling. https://t.co/HVNjGTdLFN
C: (1.000%) T: @zeefa64 This is Elizabeth Warren's way of denouncing the white race.
C: (1.000%) T: Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%. https://t.co/jJqSOsy69t
C: (1.000%) T: Now that‚Äôs what I call a Top Tier candidate response!  Also, they did ask him. He just starts talking about how he‚Äôs against open borders and how the Dayton shooter liked Elizabeth Warren and An*ifa. https://t.co/2zfMcKQyZF
C: (0.984%) T: Michael Bloomberg sasses Elizabeth Warren for digs on the 1 percent https://t.co/zc1ql9a5sy via @nypost
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister @brycetache Although I‚Äôm all in for Elizabeth Warren (but I *will* for the Dem candidate), I have always thought very highly of Joe, but that‚Äôs more than a ‚Äúgaffe‚Äù. This is genuinely, genuinely concerning. Now think that he would be 82 at the end of a first term.
C: (0.988%) T: Join me in supporting Elizabeth Warren via @actblue https://t.co/lP58vxAG60
C: (1.000%) T: do people afraid of Elizabeth Warren coming off as "elitist" not know about her extreme BALLERS fandom? this is why we need an informed electorate!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a new plan to protect our communities from gun violence.   Yes it's about mass shootings, but it's also about the gun violence that happens every day with Black and Brown communities particularly impacted. https://t.co/ATaroePGAr
C: (1.000%) T: @AmandaBlackb The most recent one from Dayton Ohio was a liberal who was obsessed with Elizabeth warren. It‚Äôs not trump. It‚Äôs social media and society who give them their five seconds of fame
C: (0.988%) T: I think @MSNBC likes Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @jeffsguardian @grumpybirdieS IMO Elizabeth Warren wouldn't completely tarnish a #PresidentBernieSanders term.  Maybe I'm underestimating how important VP is but Bernie Sanders is going to have to fill his cabinet with Democrats.   There aren't many good ones....plenty who are worse than Warren ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
C: (0.949%) T: @chuckwoolery Elizabeth Warren is a genuine person. Trump is a genuine lying, racist, cheating piece of shit! I think Hitler was a genuine person, too, so that means absolutely nothing!
C: (1.000%) T: @DykeVanTom @MotherJones That's Mrs. Elizabeth Warren to you. Get it straight.  Or, is this above your pay grade?
