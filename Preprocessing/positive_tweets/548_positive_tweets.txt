C: (1.000%) T: @walkmehome1234 @acitrep @maggieNYT One was and Elizabeth Warren fan and leftist and supported antifa. Is it her fault for that person? I would say no. Just like the other isn't Trump's fault.
C: (0.990%) T: Senator Elizabeth Warren surged past Senator Bernie Sanders in the Monmouth University Iowa poll, showing support for Democratic presidential candidates shifting among likely Iowa caucus-goers in the critical primary state.  https://t.co/WYA1UCZsXP
C: (1.000%) T: @DineshDSouza What an even bigger coincidence is her job is to cover Elizabeth Warren! What are the odds of that? 1:1?
C: (0.689%) T: @Gulfcoast_Stan @CNN @CNNOpinion But it’s okay to blame Elizabeth Warren. After all talking about curtailing corporate influence and corruption is enough to make a dozen mass shooters. Right?
C: (1.000%) T: I (surprisingly) found the framing here a little shaky at times, but of course loved reading about Warren and teaching. https://t.co/Ueo31At9um https://t.co/PjDfVlSmst
C: (1.000%) T: @drmoore The #DaytonShooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren, was connected to #ANTIFA, and was into satanism.  The #ElPaso shooter originally had social media indicating he was a #Democrat.  Neither had these "White National Terrorist" aspects that you people are making up.  Sick.

C: (0.543%) T: @JoeNBC If you support Elizabeth Warren or AOC you support left wing murderers.
C: (0.995%) T: Sorry, what? Populism is about pitching “ordinary people” against supposed nefarious elites. Has George Packer listened to Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders et al?!?!? The mind boggles. https://t.co/MQgSKELIqc
C: (0.546%) T: @lahomar @omayasosa So blood is on Elizabeth Warren in Ohio.  The psycho in Dayton was a fan of her. Same logic.
C: (1.000%) T: @WillWalton13 So because a mentally deranged person shot people, that’s somehow Trump’s fault? He’s already denounced it. What about the Dayton shooter being an Elizabeth Warren fan? Is that her fault?? The correct answer is no for both. Any rational person understands this
C: (1.000%) T: @RepAdamSchiff Really?? I guess @SenWarren is a white supremacist... https://t.co/qp5lXPmMrU
C: (0.728%) T: @Herbert_L_Reed @LibertyLady45 I was suspended for 3 days. Never use potty language but am a conservative. Unfortunately white so Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker would assign me racist epitaphs
C: (1.000%) T: @mikeo188 @KamalaHarris The Dayton shooter was an anti-trump, Atheist, Elizabeth warren supporter, Satanist. Explain your meme with him please.
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris Interesting fact is you're not talking about the other shooter who took lives also...maybe because he was a democratic sponsor who loved Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders plus AOC
C: (1.000%) T: Y’all ever get emotional about hearing Elizabeth Warren speak?
C: (1.000%) T: @RashidaTlaib A security risk - &amp; it's never done - it's they're safety.  As for donors, go take a good look at the rest of the politicians &amp; their donors. Racism - Ohio shooting was a firm Elizabeth Warren supporter - you might want to ask her who her donors are.
C: (1.000%) T: @Destini41 @Anthony56089499 @SteveScalise @thecjpearson @DNC Please provide location where I can find and post list of Elizabeth Warren donors....other than abortionists which we already know about.

C: (0.839%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress What about the Ohio shooter who was a Leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren?  Or how about the Bernie supporter who shot up the Congressional baseball game? The only people at fault here are the shooters, and people like you for politicizing the loss of American lives. #Pathetic
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill Now we have the language police out. Did the Dayton shooter use language in Elizabeth Warren's speeches. What a bunch of garbage. I'm surprised the Hill is so partisan since I love Solomon &amp; Carter from there.
C: (0.985%) T: @JulianCastro The shooter in Dayton was a socialist supporter of Elizabeth Warren who was inspired by the Left's Antifa.   #KeepAmericaGreat   Support @realDonaldTrump
