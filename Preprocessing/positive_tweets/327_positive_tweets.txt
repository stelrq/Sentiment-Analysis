C: (0.992%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren not only misappropriates that label on trump who has disavowed the KKK and white supremacist at least five times but she also misappropriates that label to any person that supports Trump. This woman has no business being president.

C: (1.000%) T: @subsidingchaos I’m really energized and feel positive about Elizabeth Warren’s steady rise in the polls. She is even inching ahead of Bernie and currently in second place behind Biden.
C: (1.000%) T: The energy and the momentum for Elizabeth Warren keeps getting stronger and stronger every day. #Warren2020 https://t.co/NEhZFVCoqt
C: (0.717%) T: @IMissJamesWoods @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is now in the race-baiting business. It’s been proven that Michael was not innocent...he tried to take s policeman’s gun. To say otherwise is just a plain lie. Elizabeth Warren you are a liar... it seems about everything...Pocahontas!  You’ll never be POTUS!
C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren implored Walmart to "do the right thing — stop selling guns," in response to the El Paso shooting. "Companies that sell guns have a responsibility to the safety of their communities." https://t.co/icwOCE9j7k
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren BREAKING: Shocked by her racially incendiary, politically expedient and completely irresponsible remarks about Officer Darren Wilson ... the Lone Ranger disavows Senator Elizabeth Warren ...  Said Kemosabe, "She speaks with forked tongue ... I'm finished with Lieawatha." https://t.co/Aoh2x8Nnik

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Fuck you Elizabeth warren- hands up don’t shoot my ass he was grabbing for the officers gun- go sit down!! Fake Indian American
C: (1.000%) T: @Barnes_Law Elizabeth Warren is lying about Michael Brown’s death. Grand Jury testimony revealed he never said “Hands Up Dont Shoot” &amp; wrestled with the cop to grab his gun. Why is she stirring this up after 5 yrs, just to gain votes...? @SenWarren #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
C: (1.000%) T: @Lila_Eeyore @pdabrosca @skgilroy @AOC The media is hiding the fact that he was a Democrat &amp; an Elizabeth Warren supporter &amp; even used her name in his manifesto
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren’s getting a ton of applause at Wing Ding with a speech keyed off her new rural/farm plan (tho the biggest applause came during her close and walk-up song and wealth tax mention). Most other candidates have taken pretty national or bio focuses with their speeches.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth warren is the only one in the race that has the balls https://t.co/qqOj0ibBpc
C: (1.000%) T: @RealDeanCain I'll bet Elizabeth Warren is really dull at cocktail parties.
C: (1.000%) T: Trump "has given aid and comfort to white supremacists" and "done the wink and a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. He's done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country," Warren said. #Us_Extremist    https://t.co/EPeYkIfB8D

C: (1.000%) T: @ElBlayde @RussContreras But, Elizabeth Warren does not encourage hate speech like Trump...
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was a race baiting lying socialist. I said yes!
C: (0.990%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was an idiot.  I said yes.  I was also asked if Donald Trump was a white supremacist.  I said no.
