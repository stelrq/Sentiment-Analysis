C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren stoke money intended for minority opportunity. I said yes.  My answer is true, your‚Äôs isn‚Äôt.
C: (0.999%) T: @ChangeEvolve ... our president never said immigrants were animals, he never said all Mexicans were rapists &amp; drug dealers, the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren &amp; antifa fan, the El Paso shooter was a progressive who believed in guaranteed income, universal healthcare, &amp; climate change.
C: (1.000%) T: @MATTtheG @STEMExcelNYC @MChristo2019 @BobHoldenNYC @STEMExcelNYC  FYI  AppleSeed has 438k in assets, revenue of 521k/yr and seems to also have a White man at the helm stirring up the minorities. @MATTtheG  Vavruska is more Asian than Elizabeth Warren is Native American. Racists only see skin color.
C: (1.000%) T: I have a hunch Elizabeth Warren has a strong opinion on it.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren agrees with you: your internet is not very good. But can her newly released plan to fix it actually work? @KarlBode explores. https://t.co/Zt2WVYQ2Y4
C: (1.000%) T: @KingfaceF1 @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a clown,  a moron and a major hypocrite! She was hugging the woman making the despicable remarks of wanting to massacre Mitch outside his home! The hug was at one of her rallies so who is really encouraging the violence?  Elizabeth Warren is Despicable!!
C: (1.000%) T: Networks like CNN and Democrat candidates such as Elizabeth Warren not only think so but claim to know so (without the use of logic), especially if supporters 'Don' megahats and they've had their emotions 'whipped up', presumably white supremacist and racist ones at Trump rallies https://t.co/pMDYKQ2Rsh
C: (1.000%) T: @WordswithSteph @davidhogg111 @KellyannePolls And I guess Elizabeth Warren is to blame for the Dayton shooting right?  How about the mass shootings in Chicago EVERY weekend. Is trump to blame for them as well? https://t.co/68yxC4DPkV
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren lied about being Native American to use her ‚Äúminority status‚Äù for advantage. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Did those girls have permits?  Are taxes paid on these sales? Has this food been inspected and approved? (Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs thoughts)
C: (1.000%) T: @mom22rs @MiaFarrow Well I do know that one of the mass shooters this weekend said one of the reasons he did this was illegals were going to be getting free health care and that upset him and the other one supported Elizabeth Warren sooo there's that

C: (0.720%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Wow, Kim, big deal that whacky Elizabeth Warren gave the girls $10 instead of $7.  Alert the media!!! https://t.co/5eAbaOhKSl

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I said No. My white husband says No. My black best friend says No. But if I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is Native-American, I say No.
C: (1.000%) T: On paper, Elizabeth Warren is as electable as Joe Biden.   If you believe your own eyes &amp; ears, she is far more so. https://t.co/qxc9GfgWzv
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren was an idiot.   I said yes.    ü§î that must be true.
C: (1.000%) T: @libblubon @tribbleday @VoteBlueNow @Hollow_Raven @AndrewHClark @BetoORourke Wait a second if I'm defending women how am I misogynistic?   even though they were completely false at least you gave some clear reasons why you do not like Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren. Smart as a whip. Experienced. Tough. Had tough times in her life. Ex-Repub. Brothers in military. Fights for right &amp; honor. We need someone who can clean up the mess tRump has made, restore our Country‚Äôs honor &amp; honor &amp; dignity to the White House. Warren2020 https://t.co/XFW31nxMep

C: (1.000%) T: Broadband infrastrcture for the 25% of Americans living on 97% of the land will hilariously blow up this budget. That being said, Internet infra should be a (costly) public good.  But in terms of government-owned ISPs...it seems Elizabeth Warren has a CCCP-inspired plan for that. https://t.co/bp3WgwAKju
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/6TfUYtfsaJ
