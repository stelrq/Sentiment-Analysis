C: (1.000%) T: Attended the grand opening of the Elizabeth Warren headquarters in Cola, SC and it’s a great space! My favorite part? The kids’ room, Bailey themed, so folks can bring their children along on their volunteer shift. Thanks for having a plan for that @ewarren! 💙💙💙 https://t.co/FoZTctnueO

C: (0.543%) T: Should be Elizabeth Warren's 2020 campaign ad. You may not like @realDonaldTrump but he says what he means, and doesn't pretend to be something he isn't. #TRUMP2020Landside https://t.co/9gDkpdDYWT
C: (0.667%) T: @GOPChairwoman Keep worrying about Biden while Elizabeth Warren is running rings around your dumb asses.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren And everyone says Elizabeth Warren is wooden, inauthentic &amp; has no sense of humor.   The first two are def true, but apparently Warren can be funny..”when I’m president..” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
C: (1.000%) T: @Liz_Wheeler Elizabeth Warren pretty much disqualified herself from holding (any) public office by slandering a policeman whose “crime” was to be white! It is indicative of a lack of character and ethical structure!

C: (1.000%) T: Under Elizabeth Warren's new plan, the excise tax on handguns would rise from 10% to 30%, and the tax on ammunition would jump from 11% to 50%.... https://t.co/NkrZOoXuYD
C: (1.000%) T: "Elizabeth Warren is running a campaign of hope and optimism and enthusiasm as surely as did Ronald Reagan, that ol' Iowa radio guy, in 1980, and as surely as Barack Obama did in 2008."  They get it. https://t.co/ig5GM4m30D
C: (1.000%) T: y’all dont like elizabeth warren because she speaks what’s on her mind and won’t back down. if she was a man this wouldn’t even be a problem https://t.co/6h4xP3pqNn

C: (0.988%) T: @lunadyana @EricShapiro3 @nytpolitics What do you all think of Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter Friday that Michael Brown was “murdered” by a “white” policeman in Ferguson, Mo. This is an absolute whopper and obviously does nothing to calm racial tension in this country. Yet it’s gotten almost no coverage@brithume
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @IowaStateFair Now why can't this country elect decent people like Elizabeth Warren President? Is there something wrong with our media?
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill Elizabeth Warren is always positive, speaking from her heart (without a teleprompter), provides facts, and always has a plan.
C: (0.986%) T: Elizabeth Warren looks addied the fuck out 24/7
C: (1.000%) T: I am still pissed that Elizabeth Warren called officer Darren Wilson a white murderer.  That was no joke. She is a leading Democrat candidate, and yet where are the progressives calling her out, and telling her to step down?
C: (1.000%) T: @timjacobwise Well said! I have absolutely **nothing** against Elizabeth Warren - but her “I have a plan for that” isn’t the message we need right now. Her campaign must be listening, as they’re not pushing that much anymore

C: (1.000%) T: Both Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren used twitter on Friday to state the fact that Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer. I hope more people, candidates or not, develop the ability to admit this. https://t.co/vzVkuAfLmd
C: (1.000%) T: @TheMarkPantano @NoTatsClassy @TrumpWarRoom @parscale @realDonaldTrump Hell, just vote the Democrat in and let the civil war begin anyway. This shit was all coming to a head. All because families didn't take responsibility to get their loved ones help. The kid in Dayton was talking to demons ( and Elizabeth Warren).
