C: (1.000%) T: @B52Malmet @ewarren Elizabeth Warren who lied from her early days stealing valor from Native Americans MOST DEFINITELY IS NOT THE ANSWER.  How can anyone trust a POS like this.  No thanks.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Rational people know that Elizabeth Warren and Antifa don't have a lot in common.
C: (0.934%) T: @cweiser @jwilliamscincy @Enquirer @SharonCoolidge But the shooter was a far left satanic nut. He seemed to like Elizabeth Warren as a presidential candidate.
C: (1.000%) T: @rachbarnhart You only say this because you are a democRAT! I have heard a word out of you or your democratic commrades about the Dayto Ohio @ewarren Elizabeth Warren democRAT shooter!! They are just as important as your anti @realDonaldTrump post on El Passo! Democratic trash reporting!
C: (1.000%) T: @RepMaryGonzalez You do know the shooter is an ANTI-TRUMP hardcore LEFTIST Bernie Bro who supports Elizabeth Warren.   He HATES Trump supporters.

C: (1.000%) T: Bernie supporters are a niche group at this point. They dont even like Elizabeth Warren lol.
C: (0.998%) T: And, while right wingers are pretending otherwise, it's not just Trump donors. By law, everyone running for president makes their donor list public. Here are the heroes donating to Elizabeth Warren: https://t.co/vp10trb4X3
C: (1.000%) T: @thatgirlfrmOhio He literally supported Elizabeth Warren are you dumb? Now I'm not gonna do what you're doing and blame her, because even though I don't support Warren I find that notion fucking stupid since she doesn't do hate speech. But at least TRY not to be disingenuous next time, please?
C: (1.000%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress I noticed you conveniently forgot to mention the Ohio shooter who was a leftist Ant1fa and big Elizabeth Warren fan. You are a hypocrite troll shill. Change your life. https://t.co/b3Cw5OYqpW

C: (1.000%) T: @alexsalvinews @JBaker31826004 @OANN Joe is just like Elizabeth Warren they both lie so much they themselves think it is the truth.
C: (1.000%) T: Red Flag Law has nebulous qualification standards to confiscate guns from gun owners and on flip side an even less clear legal remedy for getting their gun(s) back.    https://t.co/p2sDLC1bBo
C: (0.965%) T: When will Democrats learn that guns are inanimate objects they can't hurt anyone?  People are to blame for killing no one else, any object can be used to kill.  Will Democrats try to ban every object ever used to kill?  People KILL People!  https://t.co/2kz9gLf8Bd

C: (1.000%) T: Dayton Ohio shooter subscribed to Elizabeth Warren's ideology! However Media's coverage only hyped up El Paso shooting because they felt they could attack Trump! The media is responsible for a lot of the decisiveness in the United States! STOP BLAMING TRUMP FOR FOR UR ISSUES!
C: (1.000%) T: That Elizabeth Warren has a plan for everything, from saving the economy from the huge Trump-GOP deficits to actually becoming President of the United States, as you can see in this article, below. I miss hearing smart people like @ewarren in government. https://t.co/4vJFoNsCBh
