C: (1.000%) T: Trump draws crowds of 15,000 plus. Elizabeth Warren brings out a multitude of one. In a corn field. And she loses in the exchange that ensues.  Future leader of the free world? Hmm. https://t.co/cuODTLP36y

C: (1.000%) T: @kburton40 @akkitwts Precisely.  Obama was a sellout.  America needs a Bernie Sanders.  Or an Elizabeth Warren.  Somebody who won't stop fighting no matter what, who won't go back on their promises.  AND, a Movement to hold that leader accountable.  Like Bernie's #OurRevolution #Sanders #Warren

C: (1.000%) T: @DJBurn77 @apppro1 @ByronYork @SebGorka So then Bernie Sanders is responsible for the shooting of Steve Scalise right?

C: (1.000%) T: @DineshDSouza Everything about Elizabeth Warren is staged and deliberate. Nothing is spontaneous! Unlike my President, @POTUS, almost everything is spontaneous which is very refreshing and which is why we love üíï ‚ù§Ô∏è üíó Trump!!! #Trump2020
