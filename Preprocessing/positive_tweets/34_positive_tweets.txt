C: (1.000%) T: @conservmillen @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren would lie and purposely misrepresent her cultural heritage for personal gain. I said yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I was asked today if Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee. I said no but I am &amp; we can stand that lying witch race baiter.
C: (1.000%) T: @AuthorKimberley @catikins9 I really, really want to see that happen. Elizabeth Warren wiping the floor with his head would be awesome.
C: (1.000%) T: @wittelstephanie So by your logic the Dayton shooting happened because of Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders?!
C: (0.988%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is way too dorky to be president.
C: (1.000%) T: .@realDonaldTrump - Aug 7  "Meanwhile, Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA." @OANN I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to FAKE NEWS.  Thank You! https://t.co/heUliEB29J
C: (1.000%) T: @Me_And_Harpua @CharlieDsmIa @demIN240 @MrFootballGuru @EmmaKinery Get over yourself and vote for the best candidate, who happens to be Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.996%) T: @fendiadlib oh so we talkin politics on the tl? elizabeth warren is the best from what I've observed. stay away from buttigieg (and here's a lengthy article as to why I think that) https://t.co/SObzciDJVy
C: (1.000%) T: @BillyBobSanderz @BobHarr1944 5 more years of TRUMP. You libs will be in MENTAL HOSPITALS by the time Trump leaves office. You do know that both of shooters were from the left right? How bout posting Elizabeth Warren donner list. After all according to YOUR rules she's responsible. Shooter quoted her and AOC https://t.co/FdWehQBx9j
C: (0.985%) T: @seankent @MrTommyLand And then, who was the Ohioâ€™s shooter hero??? Elizabeth Warren???
C: (0.994%) T: @ScottAdamsSays And Elizabeth Warren is just white. ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/l2qtcDZMWo
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Doesnâ€™t matter if Elizabeth warren thinks trumps a white supremacist. What matters is that white supremacists think trumps a white supremacist.
C: (1.000%) T: @RealCandaceO @AOC @BetoORourke The Ohio shooter didn't quote Elizabeth Warren as his reason for his act. Warren didn't incite people against the ethnicity of the victims. If he's Warren fan, then why are you blaming AOC? You would be saying something totally different if the shooter was undocumented or Muslim.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump "Trump is now telling the world that the Dayton Shoot supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  Who cares?  Unlike Trump himself, neither of these individuals are White Supremacists who incited violence in any way, shape or form!" Ed Krassenstein #Trump #ImpeachTrump #MAGA
C: (1.000%) T: @XxBTExX Elizabeth Warren is a woman of class. She doesn't settle for that cheap garbage. You can't effectively shake down Wall Street after consuming yellow ass powder drinks.

C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions Bullshit. The El Paso shooter was making a political statement. The Dayton shooter certainly did not murder his sister and eight other people because he supported Elizabeth Warren.  If you donâ€™t get the difference I do t know what to tell you.
C: (1.000%) T: Trump "has given aid &amp; comfort 2 white supremacists" &amp; "done the wink &amp; a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. He's done everything he can 2 stir up racial conflict &amp; hatred in this country," Warren said. https://t.co/Zy4Ej3CxgA @mnewsince @joy31608
C: (1.000%) T: Biden centers campaign where he started: Trumpâ€™s character: BURLINGTON, Iowa (AP) â€” Joe Bidenâ€™s campaign is not anchored in a big policy idea like Bernie Sandersâ€™ Medicare for All. He is not proposing transformative change like Elizabeth Warren. Instead,â€¦ https://t.co/7auLzY1sju https://t.co/Qv6iNEegtV
C: (1.000%) T: These people must honestly believe that they win points at the poll for pandering  ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„  Elizabeth Warren  https://t.co/cciigWZQft
C: (1.000%) T: @FrakerMonica @_JackMoreno @Jess4Beto Just like Hillary and Bernie all over again the DNC needs to step out of the way and we tell them who we want I'm from Texas I'd prefer Beto in the Senate and Elizabeth Warren as president as of today
C: (0.993%) T: @chandlerUSA @laurenacooley @thehill This is a bailout for universities led by a professor (Elizabeth Warren). Imagine if a General Motors (GM) Executive was running for President, with a platform of bailout the car industry.
C: (1.000%) T: LEFT continues to lie &amp; keep racism alive... Candidate Elizabeth Warren Claims Ferguson Police Officer "Murdered" Mike Brown... https://t.co/zb2fi1ow6Q via @thelastrefuge2
