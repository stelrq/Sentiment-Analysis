C: (0.730%) T: @SharylAttkisson Seeing Elizabeth Warren recycle this hoax is disgusting.  She will do or say anything for a vote.
C: (0.982%) T: Sen. Warren (D-MA) has been churning out plan after plan in her bid to be the Democrat‚Äôs nominee for president in 2020.  Most of plans are wildly ill-considered and untenable, but her latest roll-out on ‚Äúgun violence prevention‚Äù is positively bone-chilling https://t.co/h8xBGE9p5D
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is just Hillary Clinton lite. Used to be a republican, will say whatever needs to be said to stay popular, and is just copying Bernie. She has a marginally better PR team tho
C: (1.000%) T: Some very good points are made here.  If I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay my student debt, I‚Äôd have chosen a better school and a more interesting but less lucrative major, writes @semanahte https://t.co/kVHWpLwDDa
C: (0.989%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt deserve to be within 2 miles of the Oval Office.  Vote her out!

C: (0.979%) T: News media and Democrats continue to ignore Dayton mass killer was a LEFT WINGER. He supported Elizabeth Warren, admired Bernie Sanders, was pro socialist, and admired Antifa.

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Leave it to Elizabeth Warren to turn human tragedy into an opportunity to sop up a few billion more for one of her "hamsters in space" public works programs... #GunControl #2A #HamstersNeedMoney
C: (1.000%) T: @joe41clayton @RustyBelinda You mean like the Bernie Bro who shot up a Republican baseball practice? Or the Dayton shooter who killed in the name of Elizabeth Warren? Or the Tacoma, Washington ICE facility shooter/bomber who took his language from AOC regarding "concentration camps"?
C: (1.000%) T: Dear ‚Å¶@washingtonpost and ‚Å¶@GeorgeWill‚Å© - I‚Äôm sure Oren Cass appreciated reading this personal screed, but why publish it for the rest of us - just put a stamp on it and mail it.   https://t.co/BsIgOXDLEa
C: (0.719%) T: @VampiricMoth @FergusABlair @hayleyglyphs thinking Elizabeth Warren is more leftist than an explicit anticapitalist because she‚Äôs a woman
C: (1.000%) T: @Ibishblog Elizabeth Warren figured that out. She is still refining her message but it is much more direct and accessible. She has a teacher‚Äôs ability to communicate
C: (0.999%) T: @marklevinshow Funny how your autocorrect replaced ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù with ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren‚Äù. ü§î  That‚Äôs how Trumpsters like you roll. Everything that Trump is guilty of, you project it onto someone else.

C: (1.000%) T: On Ferguson, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris Told a Terrible Lie https://t.co/xOU43V4d7Z @LouO53 Is this the way you win by not telling the truth? Surely you are better than this to try to incite violence
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren That is a scary thought...Elizabeth Warren is making plans. For like how you run Massachusetts Liz...We all know how bad you are as our Senator. I cannot even fathom your flecklessness in the White House..scary thought.
C: (1.000%) T: @petefrt @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews @CNN @MSNBC @nprnews @nytimes @washingtonpost @thehill @politico Elizabeth Warren is so power crazy, she will pander to any anything that seems to suit you. As the wind changes, so doe Warren, which makes her a very untrustworthy person.
C: (1.000%) T: How about finger prints &amp; DNAs to match with real Epstein‚Äôs . That‚Äôs simple just like Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs case. https://t.co/olGbUy4rxa
C: (1.000%) T: @DemandReal @marizel7 @ACrazyWoman @realDonaldTrump And it seems that @AOC and the other freshman Representatives are raising some good awareness of this... I support them more along with Elizabeth Warren because they're raising concerns about this issue...
C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner White Nationalist is a talking point for all of you DemocRATS/Meatheads because everything you've thrown at our President hasn't stuck! From what I understand the Dayton shooter was a Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren supporter was he a white nationalist also?
C: (1.000%) T: @bigbluelake1 Your choice to believe as you wish, i feel the same way about all democrat presidential candidates currently running, not smart enough.  https://t.co/wNxm3ZFZH7  https://t.co/Wvo8V6c6DP
