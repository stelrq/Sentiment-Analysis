C: (1.000%) T: Almost the truth but CNN just couldn't tell the whole story.  He was an Elizabeth Warren supporter! https://t.co/qEniPLeJI5
C: (0.995%) T: @charliekirk11 Hey dipshit you’re gonna have to point me to the statements where Elizabeth Warren fomented violence against the Dayton barhopping scene.
C: (0.991%) T: @realDonaldTrump By the way the Dayton Ohio shooter was a socialist Elizabeth Warren supporter! No one is blaming her for the shootings because it’s irresponsible to do so!
C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton shooter had an extreme left Twitter feed From CNN Aug. 3, the day of the shooting, when he retweeted a post saying, “Millenials have a message for the Joe Biden generation: hurry up and die.”  He also retweeted support for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: Why are news organizations like @CNN &amp; @ABC pretending NOT to know that the Dayton Ohio shooter was a left wing fan of Elizabeth Warren &amp; Antifa?  Why do they pretend that all they know is his interest in violent ideologies?  @realDonaldTrump @RealCandaceO @Joy_Villa @w_terrence
C: (0.742%) T: @CoryBooker The idiot in Ohio is a socialist Elizabeth Warren supporter moron. Don’t you know how to read
C: (0.950%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump So Elizabeth Warren inspired the Dayton attack? And Bernie Sanders inspired the attack on GOP congressmen that almost killed Steve Scalise?? Interesting logic...
C: (1.000%) T: @TeekeeMon @cody_k @JakeReif @KamalaHarris New Quinnipiac poll is full of great news for Elizabeth Warren! She's risen to 21% approval in  (vs Biden's slowly sinking 32%).  Great momentum, brilliant campaign. By the primaries she'll be nipping at Uncle Joe's toes, if not overtaking him. @BernieSanders has slipped to 14%!
C: (1.000%) T: @_stephenbell_ I knew you'd say that first part and it's true, but only one candidate willingly owns that label, which I think is a mistake. Again this is a lot about labels. Dem Soc is misguided. When you hear Elizabeth Warren talk about how / why she is still a capitalist, it does a lot IMO.
C: (1.000%) T: Time to break up @Ebay for all of their liberal bullshit they pull on people. Imagine Ebay type people running our country. They would look like AOC and Elizabeth Warren. Very scary. ZERO logic. Pathetic. #BreakUpBigTech
C: (1.000%) T: @strayhorsedad @btmikk @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Uh... like the Elizabeth warren supporting Dayton socialist? The guy who shot a republican at a softball game? The eco terrorist in El Paso? I can keep going.
C: (1.000%) T: I don't believe Veronica Escobar and notwithstanding her stupidity; and the fact that the shooter supported Elizabeth Warren and Socialism. Many more people want the President to go and he should.  Those who don't approve can stay the hell home! https://t.co/zhs5Vn8Fd7
C: (0.706%) T: @TomiLahren He was also a fan of Elizabeth Warren and Satan worshiper.
C: (1.000%) T: @dmataconis @mchastain81 "The account retweeted messages supporting Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as posts against ICE agents, including one that said, "these people are monsters," and multiple posts condemning police, and supporting Antifa protesters, who often use violent tactics."
C: (1.000%) T: FACT-CHECK: Rapper Cardi B jumped to Twitter and declared the mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio, was a “white supremacist.”   VERDICT: She failed to mention that the killer was a left-wing, Elizabeth Warren supporter. https://t.co/sxhYPDlqd6
C: (1.000%) T: @TomiLahren Elizabeth Warren's message of free college and affordable health care must have really gotten to him.
C: (1.000%) T: ... On the left like Booker that can't even take care of Newark New Jersey which pretty much takes care of itself because it's Mobsters LOL and Kamala Harris the smokes a joint and listens to rappers that haven't even been discovered yet, and Elizabeth Warren that still thinks ..
C: (0.987%) T: @AOC AOC, WHY ARE YOU NOT CALLING OUT ELIZABETH WARREN? The Gun owner in Dayton was a flaming liberal that loved Warren, why are you not calling her out? maybe because she’s a democrat and doesn’t fit your false narrative/ Again, your a fake and fraud...
C: (0.524%) T: 2020 poll: Elizabeth Warren boosted by debates but Biden paces 2020 Democratic field - CNNPolitics https://t.co/Xt5W55ElmA
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren’s supporter who did the killings, harmed Americans more than known but Warren, obviously not.
C: (1.000%) T: Including a cast with James Rodriguez and Lionel Messi, if anyone can stop the convicted sexy high heels, it's Elizabeth Warren. (☆☆☆☆)
C: (1.000%) T: @SenTedCruz      Dayton shooter supported Gun Control and Socialism.  No surprise. https://t.co/kmbYSeixni
C: (0.877%) T: @C_may93 Moron. The Zombie Dayton shooter was exposed as an extreme far left Elizabeth Warren supporter. #FalseFlag #DemocratesAreDestroyingAmerica
C: (0.524%) T: @ewarren Today I asked if Elizabeth Warren has any intelligence. I said hell no!!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren says she was asked if Trump is a white supremacist. Her LYING answer more than 1/1024th backfired https://t.co/8NbjZBeE0S via @twitchyteam
