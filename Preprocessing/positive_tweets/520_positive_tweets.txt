C: (1.000%) T: @Herbert_L_Reed @Dab7One How does Rosanna Arquette really know that for sure. Perhaps if she had a DNA testing performed, she may find out that she is more Cherokee than Elizabeth Warren. And Liz never has to apologize.
C: (1.000%) T: @MeeFarrah @CNNTonight @bettyhenderson7 @donlemon Anyway (not anyways), the other nut job was a follower of Elizabeth Warren.  When a person loses an argument on issues, they tend to attack a persons character.  Trying to assist you for future debates.  Good luck üçÄ
C: (1.000%) T: @CA_Dem Actually, the Ohio shooter was a Democrat supporter of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The El Paso shooting, the shooter said the reason he did what he did was because American citizens were going to have to pay more taxes to give illegals healthcare for free.
C: (0.699%) T: @kevinomccarthy I‚Äôve donated to Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, RAICES, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and the SPLC recently. And I don‚Äôt care if anybody knows that, because I‚Äôm not embarrassed to have donated money to any of those people or organizations.
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 #FritzORourke he needs to step up to his own Irish Catholic Heritage, no better than what Elizabeth Warren did with her heritage!
C: (1.000%) T: @amaizieng @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats C'mon maizie, I'm your friend   Is the Elizabeth Warren supporter shooter a #WarrenTerrorist?  If I was fair, I'd say no

C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC They also didn‚Äôt blame Elizabeth Warren because one of her followers killed 9 people in Ohio. No politician is to blame, the killers are to blame. That makes Republicans are doing the right thing, however liberals are off the rails and it will  certainly backfire in 2020!
C: (1.000%) T: @JayCostTWS Also why not free pizza? Elizabeth Warren could propose a $2 trillion nationalization of all the pizza parlors.
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC @maddow Were Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris silent today?  I watch all day and saw not a second of coverage of their comments on El Paso and Dayton.
C: (1.000%) T: @llauralouisiana @MatthewJshow @real_defender @realDonaldTrump Did Elizabeth Warren "start the fire" in Dayton Ohio?  You're really twisted. I hope you know that.
C: (0.989%) T: @BillKristol @DJx1555 Sane Americans deserve Elizabeth Warren. YOU DO NOT.
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol We ALL deserve Elizabeth Warren. Because it would be the best thing to happen to America since FDR. Take your passive aggressive bullshit and go fix your own racist party.

C: (0.995%) T: @ewarren What an honor it would be to have Elizabeth Warren as POTUS.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚Äúset aside an hour to at least read Warren‚Äôs plans. You‚Äôll see that on just about every grave threat facing Americans today, she offers a plausible theory of the problem and a creative and comprehensive vision for how to address it.‚Äù  https://t.co/ZUNobx2UA2

C: (0.656%) T: @TruthcastersTv @Breaking911 You mean like the Dayton Ohio Antifa Elizabeth Warren supporter?
C: (1.000%) T: @lhfang Elizabeth Warren wants to break up facebook, and get rid of private equity.  Not sure if that would solve everything, but it would help a lot.
C: (1.000%) T: Trump apparently tweeted this on AF1 heading to Dayton from El Paso.  A few days after calling for ‚Äúone voice‚Äù of unity, Trump attacks:  Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley "Sleepy Joe Biden" Beto O‚ÄôRourke Elizabeth Warren Shepard Smith https://t.co/gyptpNf7y9
C: (1.000%) T: We saw @ewarren in Iowa today. She was AMAZING. She brought down the house.Then my daughter almost fell off the stage, and Elizabeth Warren caught her. If she can save Alma, she can save our country! #Warren2020 https://t.co/Ug9KdY21ST
C: (1.000%) T: @Sra_DJGC @purdyhaze @sunrisemvmt @ewarren @support_a_teach The first thing I'll say for Warren, Sanders, Harris, Booker, Gillibrand... they voted against Betsy Devos' confirmation. And I think that already shows how much better they are. This is also what Warren is doing: https://t.co/bGsRCKFFix
