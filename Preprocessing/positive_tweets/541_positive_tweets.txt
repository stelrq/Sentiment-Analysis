C: (1.000%) T: @NicolleDWallace I'm sending you this to record this. First of all I'm with you, I'll vote for the candidates bus but my first choice is Uncle Joe but my daughter, who is mildly disabled yet WAY into politics loves Elizabeth Warren. Needed to record that. Save it for me?üòÇLoveYa!
C: (1.000%) T: Sharing this because of the first line. "Regimes, however intellectually disreputable, rarely are unable to attract intellectuals eager to rationalize the regimes‚Äô behavior."  https://t.co/i2A4Aoa7tn
C: (0.996%) T: @Ksmith929 @Itsmyyalia @iCount_7shots @PremeTvinc @HBCUfessions Elizabeth Warren has a few good policies too.
C: (1.000%) T: @winstonCovfefe Am I the only one that sees that Elizabeth Warren is batshit crazy? Just looking at her eyes  &amp; her mannerisms.  It's all there.
C: (0.545%) T: @TwinklingTania https://t.co/ECNgKnTiTu  https://t.co/H17Ldk41Py  Read these 2 articles.  The claim of "largest crowd" came the day before Sanders spoke.  His crowds described as "overflowing".  Look at the pictures.  It's clear, both had damn impressive crowds.
C: (0.998%) T: "Bernie Sanders.. class-struggle politics give us the best chance we have to take on the fossil fuel companies.. avoiding catastrophic climate change requires electing the only candidate calling for a political revolution". Great piece by @Matthuber78   https://t.co/qTEZyN27AF

C: (1.000%) T: good morning! Bernie Sanders does better among lower income and POC voters than Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: So there‚Äôs a pretty good chance I‚Äôm voting for Elizabeth Warren after this video https://t.co/TNVRF9wv5f
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúMr. Kennedy has introduced legislation aimed at making the MSRB‚Äôs public directors more independent. The measure has support from Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, along with Sen. Doug Jones (D., Ala.).‚Äù

C: (1.000%) T: @BernieBroStar @PamKeithFL not to mention Corey "I've never seen a check from Big Pharma I didn't like" Booker as VP??? Dream scenario is Bernie POTUS, Nina Turner Chief of Staff or VP and Elizabeth Warren as Treasury Secretary.
C: (0.989%) T: ‚ÄúBoth Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Harris were significantly penalized in this scenario...‚Äù

C: (1.000%) T: @frinkenomics For sure. I notice Elizabeth Warren has come dressed as Bernie Sanders.
C: (0.998%) T: Elizabeth Warren should shut her cake hole. who in their right mind is going to pay for such an idiotic plan. The Medicare program is barely solvent now. wanting to extend it to everyone is saying the government can afford anything. Even if their stealing from all of us stops. https://t.co/idmzEQbyKT
C: (0.990%) T: @kentsomers @azcentral I thought he was running vs Elizabeth Warren in MA? What happened to that? So he challenges someone no one in the country ever heard of? I follow politics and I have never heard of him I'm in MN. Though!
C: (1.000%) T: @LitzGerald @petekachu @Fiorella_im @FirePuff12 Yesterday, Facebook and Twitter sent me a notice to join @circle_cosmic - my own biz pages - in following Elizabeth Warren... which Circular Soul Studios is NOT! I suppose they're sending it to everyone who follows me. Newsflash! It's not Russia influencing elections.
C: (1.000%) T: @FitzpatrickMO It is ABSURD how the wealthy in this country live. And we just toss the poor aside. Shame on you for condoning that!!  We need more folks like Elizabeth Warren who actually have plans and see the disgrace this country is headed in.
C: (1.000%) T: Charlie Cook's  Iowa -- "After driving more than 500 miles around Iowa ... the two strongest impressions I received were just how fragile Joe Biden‚Äôs front-runner status is, and how Elizabeth Warren's ascendancy continues to be underestimated."  @CookPolitical #Iowa
C: (1.000%) T: @BurgSkeletal @justme_lilly @JoM1227 @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren has railed against the skyrocketing costs of college. Elizabeth Warren also received $400,000 to teach one class. One semester.
C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro But, the Walmart heirs already have millions .. $11 an hour won't get workers to that goal working for Walmart. I wonder if Elizabeth Warren pays her fair share of taxes that she expects from other millionaires.
C: (1.000%) T: "A law student makes the case against Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren's push for 'free' college in a new Wall Street Journal op-ed"  Sanders/Warren = IDIOTS.  https://t.co/XqtllOnM2y https://t.co/rZeIUHrntK
C: (1.000%) T: I feel like Elizabeth Warren is a True Socialist, you know?
