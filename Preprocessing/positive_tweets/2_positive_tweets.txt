C: (1.000%) T: @sherrilee7 @stuartpstevens I sent $10 each to Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, the Texas guys(Beto &amp; Julián) just because I like all of them and wanted them to be in the debates.   Still deciding which one to vote for.  Also money to Christine Mann for TX-31 &amp; MJHager for Tx Senator
C: (1.000%) T: @RosemaryMcL @KathyPTillman @CNN @MSNBC Then let's vet Elizabeth Warren, too. Her stance on Medicare-for-All, her being a definitive northeastern liberal and her squeaky voice and constant preachiness are serious strikes against her in terms of her being able to win in the key Midwest swing states.
C: (0.988%) T: @OverpaidA @JammieWF @ewarren S h h h h h, you're messing up Elizabeth Warren's narrative.
C: (1.000%) T: @pesterplarson3 I agree. It is too early and it needs to play out. I actually like a few of the candidates. Elizabeth Warren is at the top of my list so far. I will #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

C: (1.000%) T: @flyaway_k @RichardEngel Not many people I would want to talk to for 2 hours but I’m gonna go with Elizabeth Warren. My student loan debt is unforgiving.
C: (1.000%) T: @NDemleitner Any comment on two licensed attorneys, one a law professor, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren staring Michael Brown was “murdered”? Especially given even the DOJ stated the use of force was justified?
C: (0.955%) T: calling Biden the most “electable” candidate is code for the most “moderate” or white candidate. Left-wing candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are each frequently dogged in corporate media by accusations that they are somehow not “electable” enough https://t.co/bmEpMtYnHI
C: (0.641%) T: Warren Calls on Walmart to Stop Selling Guns: 'No Profit Is Worth Those Lives' Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) called on retailers like Walmart to "stop selling guns," arguing that they have a responsibility to their communities and are shirking their duties by putting profits …
C: (0.987%) T: @atensnut Elizabeth Warren is so excited exclaims, "YEAH HILLARY, NO POOP STAIN ON YOUR TROUSERS TONIGHT!... WHOO-HOO"
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren lied about her ethnicity in order to gain a disingenuous professional advantage over other people. I said yes.
C: (0.722%) T: @SenWarren It is terrible that Trump calls people names, say it with me, I AM A HYPOCRITE: Elizabeth Warren Labels Trump a ‘White Supremacist’
C: (1.000%) T: @GalacticaZ @realDailyWire now do the guy in dayton. he was a lefty, supported elizabeth warren. supported antifa, and other far left things. who is to blame there? oh right. the dude that killed those people including his sister. self-accountability.
C: (1.000%) T: @DJLOK @JoeBiden Elizabeth Warren posted a very similar tweet. This must be the latest Dem talking point.
C: (0.989%) T: @SenWarren You seem to want government to control our lives, I think this makes you a "communist": Elizabeth Warren Labels Trump a ‘White Supremacist’
C: (0.998%) T: @brithume For Elizabeth Warren (and the American left) the “Truth” is merely whatever will advance her cause and her career.
C: (0.540%) T: @masanaken @CarmineSabia @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump Yes, in addition to Beto, Cory Booker &amp; Elizabeth Warren all cosponsored a bill for infanticide.
C: (1.000%) T: @RWPUSA @JoeBiden @ewarren @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump I would vote for just about anyone to get rid of Trump, honestly. But I'm not loving Biden, yes, I'll go with him in the end if that's where it goes. But I am an Elizabeth Warren voter, and I have liked several candidates, none who have made it to the top.
C: (1.000%) T: @TaxReformExpert I value the opinion of Mother Teresa more than Elizabeth Warren’s https://t.co/j9YafAVCRE
C: (1.000%) T: It figures. Disarm law-abiding systems. Tell businesses what to sell and not sell to support your anti-constitutional rants.  https://t.co/Eruu8tzBjl
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren takes out the garlic and crosses against private equity. https://t.co/IO15tMGFF0 via @WSJ

C: (0.987%) T: @realDonaldTrump Between Nicole Wallace and her extermination lies to Elizabeth Warren and her Ferguson lies, some people have no connection to reality.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren you need to go away and fade out of politics entirely. We need leaders especially on the left that are doing the exact opposite of what you’re doing now. We need unifier’s to heal this extreme divide and pull this country together and not make police the enemy.
C: (1.000%) T: How can you tell when a Democrat politician is lying, and pandering to the uneducated minions who dutifully believe every word?  Quick answer: Their lips are moving, and their publicists get the words out to the "faithful." https://t.co/s8bYy2ZcHn
