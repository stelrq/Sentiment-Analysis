C: (0.973%) T: @JRubinBlogger @CNNPolitics He was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and member of Antifa. You can't control reality with your lies.
C: (0.989%) T: @NicolleDWallace Bob O'Rourke has become totally unhinged. Don't hear him complaining about the Dayton shooter supporting Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Antifa!!
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke Stop lying, you empty suit. You are from the rich family, who didn't trust the local schools and send you to Latin America private school. You are not Hispanic.Try to prove it to us, like Elizabeth Warren did with her Indian heritage.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC I am very proud that my friends and family know I contribute to Elizabeth Warren every month.
C: (0.982%) T: @JoeNBC I forgot the last time i felt embarrassed..lol. Hell no, I'm 61 years old, mother of 3 sons, 5 grdkts, 5 dogs and got off all meds (except 1) after I was prescribed THC. I Voted for Obama, TWICE, and will be voting for Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Elizabeth Warren for VP and Harris AG.
C: (1.000%) T: @jennerific713 @realDonaldTrump Um he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, if you‚Äôre going to accuse a group try getting the facts first, but those probably won‚Äôt matter to you anyways unless MSM tells you to think that way....
C: (1.000%) T: @Garossino Elizabeth Warren sent out a mass email asking for fundraising donations for her campaign shortly after the shooting. That's taking advantage of a domestic terrorist attack for her own campaign. Trump visiting a hospital is comforting.
C: (0.973%) T: @RepAlGreen @CNN How will you blame Trump for the Dayton shootings too although they are fans of Antifa, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie?!! I'm sure fake news CNN will help you spin it!!
C: (1.000%) T: @magi_jay Agreed.  Better to use the opportunity to raise campaign funds like Elizabeth Warren and Kam Harris. üëçüèª
C: (0.986%) T: Shouldn't she encourage they protest Elizabeth Warren? Just sayin'. https://t.co/Xnav5MKDBm
C: (0.987%) T: @KUTV2News Ummmm wasn't one of this weekend's shooters an Elizabeth Warren and antifa supporter? Why YES, Yes he was. Somehow the media keeps forgetting that inconvenient fact. https://t.co/hT3c2GYBDc
C: (1.000%) T: @barncat26 Also, they have to worry about someone like Elizabeth Warren, whose policy positions toward China sound even more stringent. So if he caves, I think they'll deal.
C: (1.000%) T: I support Senator Kamala Harris for president and a 2020 Democratic ticket of two of these women:  Stacey Abrams Tammy Duckworth Kirsten Gillibrand Kamala Harris Sherrilyn Ifill Caroline Kennedy Amy Klobuchar Michelle Obama Ayanna Pressley Dina Titus Elizabeth Warren Sally Yates
C: (1.000%) T: Someone needs to tell Elizabeth Warren about all these gays paying $4000/yr to lift weights and run on a treadmill
C: (1.000%) T: @CindyLouWhoot @regrock29 @dana1981 @TuckerCarlson Did u see the one where the shooter in Ohio is a left-wing democrat who supports Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is every fifth grade girl who just finishes the damn school group project herself instead of waiting for everyone else to get their act together. (I am also this girl) https://t.co/CAlDHZeuCH
C: (1.000%) T: WARREN‚Äôs GOING TO  CONTROL HSIA? HOW? BY TEARING RVERY LARGE COMPANY DOWN?? Elizabeth Warren unveils $85 billion proposal to guarantee high-speed internet access https://t.co/UjXfmSu5DS
C: (1.000%) T: Unfortunately sleepy Joe only means more of the same as he has already assured the billionaire class &amp; the poisoning &amp; polluting crony Capitalistic Corporations that they have nothing to worry about a Biden presidency. Elizabeth Warren will/has stand up to those who need it. https://t.co/61jXsTThdJ
C: (1.000%) T: Of course it's big, bold, and well thought out.  It's an Elizabeth Warren plan. https://t.co/jWBbwacwBH
C: (1.000%) T: @RMFifthCircuit No, he‚Äôs making this face because he just thought of a clapback to Elizabeth Warren and is trying to figure out whether he should issue a press release about it.
C: (1.000%) T: @flyaway_k @RichardEngel Elizabeth Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I want to listen to what they have to say to each other, especially since they both eventually will be President.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Dear Elizabeth Warren. If you wish to tackle gun violence in America. First you must create a gun owners register. Where all gun owners would be required to register their firearms. All NRA members who are cautious owners would probably be grateful collectors.
C: (1.000%) T: Male paths to presidential endearment are apparently off the table for women. So what are they going to do? For Elizabeth Warren, the answer lies in her past as a teacher, @rtraister reports https://t.co/q7lDDl6ZnL
C: (1.000%) T: Someone please fact check whether multiple people have expressed the desire to "grab a beer" with Elizabeth Warren. I'm not buying it. https://t.co/sRhh4B7bK0
