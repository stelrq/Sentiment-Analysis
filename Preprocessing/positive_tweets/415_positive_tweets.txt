C: (0.996%) T: @AndrewSnarks Your logic is flawed. It’s like saying because the Dayton Shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and a Satanist that Elizabeth Warren and thereby all Dems are Satanists.  https://t.co/V0lyJn0qhX
C: (1.000%) T: 1 mass shooter was a Trump supporter. 1 mass shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter. When I'm getting shot at I don't really care what political party you're with. I'm thinking I wish I had a gun to protect myself.
C: (1.000%) T: @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump Shooter is responsible.. Gun didn't go off by itself.. It appears The President gets blamed no mention of the person who actually committed the crime.. Shooter in Daytona was a big fan of Elizabeth Warren let's blame her!! Fair?
C: (1.000%) T: @CCINDYT7 Has Elizabeth Warren made a public apology yet for one of her supporters being responsible for the shooting?
C: (0.996%) T: @shaunking @realDonaldTrump I believe that guy also was concerned about global warming..disliked trump and was an Elizabeth Warren supporter .to talk like those facts don't exist makes you a manipulator and the very evil you accuse trump of. This is why trump wins. Cause the good guys like you are garbage
C: (1.000%) T: He’s not fit to be President.  He’s perfectly fit to have his own show on @foxnews or have his own talk radio show, but he’s simply not fit to be President. Deep down, you all know that’s true. https://t.co/jUejSUeTw7
C: (1.000%) T: @JPMediaBoss @montaga @CNN @RepMaxineWaters @CoryBooker @MSNBC @elizabethwarren @BernieSanders @abcnews @JoeBiden @BarackObama @RashidaTlaib @donlemoncnn Elizabeth Warren hasn't picked a group of people and tried to ostracize them as "others" and sic her followers at her rallies at them. Just look at how the RIGHT and LEFT handles those tings. The right is beyond dangerous.
C: (1.000%) T: Why has the media coverage of the 2 mass shootings almost strictly focused on the El Paso assault while basically ignoring Ohio?  Simply because a follower of Elizabeth Warren totally screws up the media narrative that only GOP supporters are racist and capable of evil acts.
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump - "NYT is correct I am encouraging unity over racism"  Next two tweets- "Beto is a fake Hispanic and needs to shut up!"  "The Dayton shooter killed people because he is a leftist, Elizabeth Warren supporter. @OANN Is the only real news out there reporting this!"
C: (0.988%) T: @repjohnlewis WRONG!!!  BOTH SHOOTERS WERE NOT FOLLOWERS OF TRUMP, ONE SAID HE HATED THAT DEMOCRATS WANTED TO GIVE FREE HEALTHCARE TO ALL ILLEGALS, other one WAS AN ELIZABETH WARREN FOLLOWER. SO YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO ALL AMERICANS FOR YOUR FALSE STATEMENTS!!!
C: (0.571%) T: #1andDone! We as a country cannot let that bigot in the WH stay. I want the FBI to drag his a$$ out when Elizabeth Warren wins the election! https://t.co/x7RbnNuwmF

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is better than Hillary Clinton?  This is a new one for me. https://t.co/n3Y2VYWzO9
C: (1.000%) T: @CNNPolitics And Elizabeth Warren is directly responsible for the Dayton mass shooting!  2 can play that game!
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: Trump is a white supremacist - CNN Politics. #agree  https://t.co/CWGL1If6kF
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN Is it me or is it Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke are the only ones emotionally upset about the orange Grand wizard in the White House and what he's been doing? everybody else looks like they're commenting because of political reasons

C: (0.985%) T: @CNNPolitics Anyone supporting Elizabeth Warren should be completely and totally ashamed of themself. This is despicable less because of the false allegations and more because she’s exploiting minorities with lies for votes. The KKK is a Democrat creation.
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol Yeah maybe, but I’m not rich like you or a tycoon, and I don’t deserve Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @MarisaKabas Makes Elizabeth Warren not going on Fox News stand out even more. Sometimes "getting your message to a wider audience" doesn't matter as much as not giving legitimacy to that audience's racist, homophobic platform.
