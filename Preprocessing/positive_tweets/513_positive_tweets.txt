C: (1.000%) T: @idreamofanarchy @nikoCSFB @McscNetwork No they don't. When Elizabeth Warren wavers on it we(Tulsi, Berners and other lefty groups) jump on that as we should. When Tulsi does it for some reason [some] Tulsi supporters do mental gymnastics to justify that she is being consistent https://t.co/bOA1LiRRn3

C: (1.000%) T: @TwcArthur I think Elizabeth Warren is showing  her character, policy chops, and tough mindedness by continuing to build her base of supporters who believe that she can handle Trump in a debate, hecklers on the campaign trail, and the office of President itself. She will be the nominee.

Nobody held a gun to Elizabeth Warren's head and made her and her husband falsely claim Cherokee identity while trying to pass off their disgusting tomato oatmeal and crab mayo teriyaki as actual Native family recipes.
C: (0.787%) T: @WalshFreedom Since when did Elizabeth Warren not slant something to her benefit?  That’s right, never.
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson They got no fight, which is why they’re easily captured by a self-described “fighter” to do the work for them. Plus, if you’re intimidated by Twitter comments &amp; crazy enough to blame a cand for them, maybe this ain’t the place for you.  Bill Kristol is cool with Elizabeth Warren.
