C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is too much of an opportunist 2 relate 2 We The People. She turns off most male voters &amp; almost as many female voters by her high pitched obxious voice.

C: (1.000%) T: I quit reading after 1st paragraph.  Author refers to El Paso as "racially inspired rampage" (it was).  In same sentence, author refers to Dayton shooting with no description of that shooter's beliefs, specifically  his love for Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/9YqBokkflb

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren wouldn’t tell the truth if it was hitting her in the face.  All she knows is how to yell and scream untruths. Keeps people from looking into her background. She doesnt want anybody looking into her past.  Her record as a MA Senator should speak for itself.

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren’s favorite image for businesses is that they “suck” profits out of American society like vampires. Her latest targets are private-equity firms that invest in struggling companies, often replace management and bet on a turnaround. https://t.co/fwtRmRMNn5
C: (1.000%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions 'If Trump is responsible for El Paso, Democrats are responsible for Dayton.'  That's because the Dayton shooter intended to kill as many Magats as possible and used Elizabeth Warren's words to justify it, right?  #FactsMatter

C: (1.000%) T: @AndrewHClark My candidate is Elizabeth Warren come anyday. I don't think Biden was wrong though, only the new normal is not tell the truth but speak in esoterics. I cant still forget what Biden said abt Clarence Thomas" accuser during Clarence's confirmation. But he was a gd public servant.
C: (1.000%) T: @UpNorth62 @LisaTalmadge @AnneBercilla Lots of joy in the HRC campaign of 2016. But not very much between Hillary folks and Bernie folks and we all know why.  So let's cheer when fans of two terrific women candidates dance together and celebrate Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.

C: (0.970%) T: @jodikyman By linking the Dayton shooter to Elizabeth Warren, Republicans had been giving me the impression that he was motivated by rage that everyone isn't covered by Medicare or something.

C: (0.990%) T: @mccainin4 @cspanwj Bullshit. Not a single Republican thinks the results of El Paso or anything other than murder. As far as the Dayton, that was committed by a far left Elizabeth Warren supporter

C: (0.681%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, AOC, and Beto need to dial down the anti-White rhetoric.  They triggered both of those losers.   #ImpeachJoaquinCastro  #BoycottSanantonio @ChatByCC  #WednesdayWisdom
C: (1.000%) T: Fuck this guy. Sorry Connie, but fuck this guy. Elizabeth Warren is not responsible for this.   And I’m really sad and angry that we even have to have this conversation. Because this belligerent solipsist always has to make it Someone Else’s problem. Fuck. https://t.co/dMoQmCcOV6
