C: (1.000%) T: More of this please.  Also: I know that retail politics don't have much of a moment in a presidential race, but given the pragmatic core of Elizabeth Warren's make up and story, I can't but believe that if she spent ten minutes or so with this family, she'd wow them. https://t.co/BBXreG3P8K

C: (0.760%) T: @ewarren I generally dislike Elizabeth Warren cuz she comes off fishy and war hawking. But in this case, China is breaking agreement when it comes to slowly taking back Hong Kong. And Chinese government doesn‚Äôt hold fair trials and can prosecute anyone at a whim for disagreement.
