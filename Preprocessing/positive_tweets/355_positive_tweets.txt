C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @POTUS That's good they need you now to try to lift them up , now the ugly people will say Texas was cause of you, but they won't blame Ohio on Elizabeth Warren,well it's stupid you can't stop crazy people from doing what they want to do . However the common Sense people want you there.
C: (1.000%) T: One of the shooters was a HUGE, LOYAL fan of Elizabeth Warren!  Why aren‚Äôt they blaming HER for this atrocity? Apparently everybody is fair game to blame, ESPECIALLY Trump, when in reality it‚Äôs a wack job.. and the dems like this A-HOLE want to see more people killed? GOOD JOB. https://t.co/qNCayRLaKc
C: (1.000%) T: @ABCPolitics Ohio shooter was a Elizabeth Warren supporter should we blame her?? Sanders supporter shot up Republican Congress members BB game, should we blame him. The media never reports good news. If the democrats aren't happy no one can be happy.
C: (0.988%) T: If you are blaming Trump for the shootings while also failing to recognize the Dayton shooter loved Elizabeth Warren, you are the problem
C: (1.000%) T: @ShawnInArizona @Fidgety_Kitty @ewarren Elizabeth Warren represented Dow  Chemical in a case where women were harmed by breast implants ,she doesn‚Äôt always disclose this ,but how can she be anti-big business and have made a career of representing big business over women? not truthful is bad
C: (1.000%) T: @GovInslee Connor Betts, the suspect in the Dayton mass shooting in August 2019, has on social media described himself as a leftist, expressed ‚Äúpro-Satan‚Äù views, and has stated support for Elizabeth Warren.  He was also very pro gun control....so blame warren?
C: (1.000%) T: elizabeth warren admitted the 2016 primary was rigged in favor of hillary.  yet she didn't have a problem jumping ship to join hillary.  the @DNC is pushing warren as their nominee but she is not to be trusted.  too easily swayed by 'opportunity'.

C: (1.000%) T: What? Electability? No. The biggest question hanging over her campaign (and I'm a big fan) is not electability, it's her inability to address her past claims of Native identity. Good grief.  https://t.co/i7FuvI9w4d
C: (1.000%) T: @SenWarren Do you condone or disavow Antifa?

C: (1.000%) T: @exposefakemetoo @winningalldat @Redhead196749 @Jojeification It really is and you know the Ohio shooter was different he doesn't count as a mass shooter becasue then they would have to blame Elizabeth Warren.

C: (1.000%) T: @ndrew_lawrence A bunch of people were killed in Dayton Ohio this weekend by an Elizabeth Warren supporter also is she a white supremacist also? Yet by comparison you hear very little about the Dayton shooter. Hmm I wonder what the real problem is.
