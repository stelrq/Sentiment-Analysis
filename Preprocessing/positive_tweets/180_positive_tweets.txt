C: (0.994%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Remember when Elizabeth Warren referred to majority black countries as "shithole countries"? or when she signed on to the Muslim ban? or when she referred to Mexicans as rapists? Remember when you had credibility? Yeah, neither do I.

C: (1.000%) T: As is true with all “capitalist to my bones” Elizabeth Warren’s plans, there is a market waiver, loopholes and a pragmatist logic, but no structural or even moderate change. Militarism, defense resiliency and readiness, and yes climate change are retained https://t.co/qtdoiDlOYj

C: (1.000%) T: @RoArquette White Privilege? Let's see Elizabeth Warren pretending to be an Indian to help her in Academia. Being white didn't help her there. Robert Francis O'Rourke grabbed a Latino name and get rid of Robert Francis so white privilege didn't help him. Not buying your BS
