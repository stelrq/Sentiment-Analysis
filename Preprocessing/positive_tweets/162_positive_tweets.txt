C: (0.999%) T: @GeoffMiami @Dr_CMGreer Elizabeth Warren, Kamala, and pete essentially are running a 2016 Bernie platform. This is why i dont waste time with cable news networks. Complete trash
C: (1.000%) T: @RabbiJill I have received a number of nasty responses when I respond positively to Elizabeth Warren's tweets.  My approach now is to block anyone who is rude or calls me names.
C: (1.000%) T: Someone doing a texting shift just got asked if Elizabeth Warren would release a plan regarding alien life forms ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£  I love this campaign
C: (0.512%) T: @ewarren Love you Elizabeth Warren!  You have kind words unlike the orange buffoon.
C: (1.000%) T: @LegendaryEnergy C'mon breh, saying Bernie will keep it the realist is like saying Elizabeth Warren keeps it the realist ðŸ˜‚. Still a fan haha just totally disagree w Bernie keeping it real.
C: (1.000%) T: #NC09 candidate Dan McCready is relying on out-of-state liberal groups to come to his rescue. While McCready campaigns as a moderate, he's happy to accept the help of far-left groups aligned with the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. https://t.co/UL71whcIfJ
C: (1.000%) T: @ananavarro @ewarren I donâ€™t have any tweets in Elizabeth Warren fear mongering her base, but I have these tweets from @realDonaldTrump aka #DonTheCon repeating the words INVASION like the shooter of the Latinos posted before he went into his murderous spree. https://t.co/LwVs4F5F17
C: (1.000%) T: @KurtSchlichter well, the guy was a great follower of Elizabeth warren @ewarren https://t.co/4whbQLRtxn &amp; https://t.co/3517GZNXV6 &amp; https://t.co/RynSFw1P6e &amp; https://t.co/i9UBmXQh2c stress kills https://t.co/N0x0B2qRXs his death and his ideology and the deaths of these people, are due to HER
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Show where Elizabeth Warren told 4 women of color to go back to the countries they came from. Or said white supremacist were very fine people. Or laughed when a supporter yelled shoot immigrants. If you donâ€™t see the difference youâ€™re a racist.
C: (0.837%) T: @KellyannePolls Did he leave a manifesto using Elizabeth Warren's hate speech saying he was killing the people Elizabeth targeted in her hateful rhetoric...no? Elizabeth doesn't have hate speech, you say??  Oh, well the El Paso shooter did do that on behalf on Trump
C: (1.000%) T: @bro_honest @luke_monaco @AllanIchan @mixituperin Well we can use liberal logic and say that since the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fanatic who believed in socialism, it was a politically motivated attack caused by EW.
C: (1.000%) T: Not at all surprised...only Satan would have a mind so twisted that he could influence someone to do what he did. Straight from hell and a Elizabeth Warren supporter. Lord you have all power! Protect us and let their evil intentions be revealed and... https://t.co/SglEGGENQn
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump The shooter was a Leftist who embraced Elizabeth Warren and extreme environmentalism.  And his manifesto NEVER mentions white supremacy. He believed in keeping the races separate. He didn't favor one over another. Quit your lying, you corrupt Democrat!
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Yup guess so eric.... looks like Elizabeth Warren may have inspired the Dayton shooter. Y'all keep fanning the flames there will be more. Actually ALL OF YOU are responsible.
C: (0.997%) T: Should the NDP be communicating more like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren?   Yes.
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Um... Elizabeth Warren did not call Mexicans rapists  and say we are infested with illegals. Etc etc etc   Use the brain in your head - itâ€™s there for a reason
C: (0.995%) T: @Raynoch1 Conservatives do not support the violence you seek to justify.  An Elizabeth Warren supporter carries out multiple murders - and that's not an issue for the left, even though the democrats and the fake news have spent years inciting violence - and hatred for a good POTUS.
C: (0.985%) T: @PurpleReign14 @InCastamere Was senator warren not a Republican during those years? https://t.co/8oaFwS6OC3
C: (1.000%) T: @RepEscobar Have ya passed that collections bowl around yet??? Ironically the Admired(Elizabeth Warren)of the Dayton Killer was out Campaigning before the bodies were even pik'd up. Shameless is anyone who Does Cruddy shit like that. AND DESPERATE
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN What a racist thing to say.  We need to condemn all forms of extremism.  The Dayton shooter was a socialist who supported Antifa and Elizabeth Warren.  All forms of extremism are wrong and must be eliminated.
C: (0.740%) T: @marklevinshow @bordenjoey1 Yeah I don't see any of mainstream media and Hollywood and the Democratic party saying anything about the agenda of the Democrat and follower of antifa Elizabeth Warren the wannabe and Bernie Sanders the wish you could be... I see nothing on them
C: (1.000%) T: @ladydashby Here you go. You can look up all of Elizabeth Warren's donors in Kentucky. Campaigns are required by law to report this information every 3 months.  So, the answer as to who does that is THE FEDERAL GOVERMENT.  https://t.co/S7yeL8qjJk
C: (0.994%) T: Trump - Dayton Shooter was a fan of Bernie, Antifa, Elizabeth Warren - YouTube https://t.co/lHy4z8OjQQ
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump You are high!  Where's your admonition to Elizabeth Warren?  AOC?  The rest of the flea bag left who constantly call for hating the President and now even FOX news?
C: (1.000%) T: â€œâ€˜Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.â€™  -OANN
