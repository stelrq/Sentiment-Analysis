C: (0.990%) T: Women belong in the House, the Senate and The White House: 2020 contenders from left: Sen. Amy Klobuchar (MN), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (HI), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (MA), &amp; Sen. Kamala Harris… https://t.co/pvYysOIxWZ
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Then based on your theory...any business or person who donates to @SenWarren is complicit in the crimes of the shooter in Ohio bc he followed and supported her. Yeah..he was a democrat &amp; supported Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC @ewarren ..I pride myself in being a strong supporter.  I honestly believe a Democratic Presidential ticket with Elizabeth Warren and YOU as her running mate could kick Trumps ass.  It so needs to be done.. Please consider.. Women are so much wiser than men.
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The Dayton shooter was a satanist who clung to every word Elizabeth Warren said.
C: (1.000%) T: @Fingolfin200 @Dwebbb27 @TrumplicanP @benshapiro Donna claims to be a Republican. Might be true, but she is definitely not a conservative. A conservative wouldn't be in agreement with much of anything Elizabeth Warren supports.
C: (1.000%) T: @DanielDaniels @DavidAFrench Considering the free license you take regarding definitively labeling Trump’s motivations  as “blatant racism,” I’m sure you’ll have no trouble freely discerning how this lunatic Elizabeth Warren supporter was triggered by the coverage of the El Paso event.
C: (1.000%) T: @BrandonStraka Sooo, the El Paso shooter wasn’t targeting Hispanics that was just an odd coincidence of him driving hours out of his way to find a Walmart, and the Dayton shooter was targeting people in support of something Elizabeth Warren advocates? I clearly haven’t been paying attention
C: (1.000%) T: ok lemme just say that all the presidential calls for Elizabeth Warren I’ve been getting are all promoting community events and I guess that’s pretty cool
C: (0.996%) T: .@ewarren may be banking on the fact that if @realDonaldTrump managed to capture the White House making wild promises without specifics, she can skate past the thornier details of her proposals.   @PhilipAKlein  https://t.co/IvLq4pcaRn
C: (1.000%) T: hey any current students who are supporting elizabeth warren! tomorrow night her campaign is hosting a web call for students. you can join at the link below! :-) https://t.co/CaESDZbDub
C: (1.000%) T: @photocrimes @BrandyZadrozny Guy thought Hispanics were invaders, went to El Paso to shoot thrm. Expressly laid out the connection in his manifesto.  Other guy was an Elizabeth Warren fan, shot his own sister. Wheree’s the connection?
C: (0.998%) T: @cristela9 @hulahick @Castro4Congress Or maybe they’re worried that some Castro supporters are violent and crazy, like the mass shooter in Dayton who said he would’ve “voted or Elizabeth Warren.”  Things are escalating too fast on the left and the right.
C: (1.000%) T: NEW: Elizabeth Warren has made the largest jump up in the polls, with 6 percentage points from a July 29 poll. A Warren/Sanders ticket would be a dream come true for progressives via @ErinBurnett @ewarren @BernieSanders @CNNPolitics https://t.co/O3vVkAUlPN
C: (1.000%) T: @LouDobbs @SebGorka Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren THERE YOU GO PEOPLE there working with Google to take your jobs AWAY and bringing full-time hb1 candidates! They won't even wait till they're elected they're going to show you right now! @ABC @msnbc @cnn @OANN @thehill @CBS @nbc
C: (1.000%) T: @tribelaw I'm sorry I don't remember Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders spewing out hate against a certain color of people. Can you refresh my memory?
C: (1.000%) T: @Dan37601714 @Road_trippn @realDonaldTrump @sundarpichai I was going to ask if you need examples. So, here you go. This is Trump from 3 years ago, and there are a ton more recent ones, but this should get you started. Now, don't forget to include an Example of Elizabeth Warren encouraging violence in your reply. https://t.co/S7SwcHXA3d

C: (0.995%) T: @rezaaslan What are you have to say about Elizabeth Warren who’s lefty just murdered people in Dayton Ohio?
C: (1.000%) T: Once again, the ever thoughtful @KellyannePolls distracts us with nonsense. Trying to link this tragedy to @ewarren Is just stretching.   She clearly doesn't understand diff btwn 'inspired by' &amp; visiting a website. Hard to get.   https://t.co/tIloAWVkOR
C: (1.000%) T: @BillKristol "Several former students who are now (and were then) Republicans declined to talk to me on the record precisely because they liked EW so much and did not want to contribute to furthering her political prospects by speaking warmly of her." https://t.co/Pb8lDGAqLF
C: (0.847%) T: @AOC I guess the Dayton Ohio shooting got pushed to the back because he was an Elizabeth warren supporting leftist. The 9 families who lost their loved ones in that tragedy are forgotten or ignored by democrats because it doesn’t fit their narrative. This is why they’ll lose in 2020.
C: (1.000%) T: @I_Harlequin @mint_spinache @jayokeeffe @rtraister I do not normally go searching for things for other people but I think these links might be interesting to you:  https://t.co/NfQy4elA8N https://t.co/GZ6943eZn4 https://t.co/azmNdcoccI
C: (1.000%) T: Who had Elizabeth Warren in the "first candidate to talk about Hong Kong" pool? I didn't.
