C: (0.998%) T: (8/8) The Left‚Äôs argument is that if you are to the right of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, etc., then you‚Äôre complicit in mass shootings, you‚Äôre complicit in enabling white supremacy and you‚Äôre fundamentally lacking in moral character. This is a cynical, disgusting argument.
C: (1.000%) T: @Doodisgirl @ShoeKat Careful, this is more than enough to get your guns confiscated under the new RED FLAG GUN LAWS and Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs new description of a Domestic Terrorist, much like Obama‚Äôs.

C: (0.658%) T: @classiclib3ral Very disappointed in Elizabeth Warren for her constant dehumanizing rhetoric regarding *checks notes* that guy's sister
C: (1.000%) T: @CatsAreGods @shortalbino Warren knew full well the DNC was rigging the '16 primary and did nothing about it. Tulsi Gabbard resigned her position w/ the DNC due to this rigging. https://t.co/4tNJkDCplp

C: (1.000%) T: @nksprzak Okay, so Sandy Hook happened because of Obama, right? We can play this stupid game all day, and the Ohio shooter was all yours, and an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Just stop it. Crazy, evil, mentally ill people will always find a way. Do you even think about what you say?

C: (0.651%) T: @DanMan07076337 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse Steve Scalise was shot by a Bernie supporter. The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. El Paso shooter wanted to limit the population to save the planet‚Ä¶ stop using this as a naked political ploy it's gross and you won't like where it ends.
C: (1.000%) T: @ReneCarvajal25 @RealCandaceO Have you read about the Ohio shooter who was a violent Left Wing nut who planned on voting for Elizabeth Warren??? Oh and you're selfish and uncultured and showing your hypocritical racism by calling this strong black woman "Oreo".
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib You sound ignorant, really! Dayton killer retweeted progressive dems and was a Elizabeth Warren supporter and that's a fact. You should actually read b4 u post &amp; maybe, just maybe you wouldn't sound so dumb.
C: (0.529%) T: @SenWarren @ewarren  The Daytona shooter was one of your "hateful" supporters?  https://t.co/Ixys4p5uKm
C: (1.000%) T: @deakarma75 @realDonaldTrump The Ohio shooter was a registered Democrat who supported @ewarren aka Elizabeth Warren.  Here are multiple credible links:  1) https://t.co/mieaqKV1UU  2) https://t.co/oAtCID13HT  3)https://t.co/JU2otYkjPT
C: (1.000%) T: @lightdapple @MitchKSmith He was an Elizabeth warren supporter and a liberal based off his social media and posts. There‚Äôs no political motivation yet but if there is I highly doubt it points towards trump or republicans.
C: (0.677%) T: @Toure The guy who shot up a baseball field was a Maddow MSNBC flunkie, The dallas NYC Baton Rouge cop killings were BLM inspired, the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan.  fail on your party again
C: (0.822%) T: Oh heck yes. Get me out of my dependent relationship on the big and terrible cable/internet companies and I'll love you forever.  https://t.co/gJBGpXnB6M
