C: (1.000%) T: @ddale8 @traciemac_Bmore Look at Nicolle Wallace, though. She has a great, balanced, thoughtful program. Also, Liz Warren was 100% correct about Faux Noise. https://t.co/FPFGhJBe3R
C: (1.000%) T: 50 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said their opinion of Elizabeth Warren improved after the last debate. https://t.co/nMMe2KdWDn
C: (0.905%) T: @thehill Yes, we reject Elizabeth Warren, Bernie, Beto, Kamala Harris and all the fake news media led by the deep state.
C: (1.000%) T: @RealBasedMAGA @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Except that he was a huge advocate for liberal ideology, socialism and a big fan of Elizabeth Warren. The left will say anything, they don’t care if it even resembles the truth at all. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
C: (1.000%) T: @joshua_olesen @patmpercival I’m not a trump advocate but he was making fun of her because Elizabeth Warren liked to talk about her “native culture” so much to try and get her further in her career even tho she’s like not even native? I probably would have said the same thing to her.
C: (0.992%) T: I just signed a petition canceling student loan debt for Elizabeth Warren campaign. I really want someone to do something about this problem man.
C: (1.000%) T: It struck me as odd in that original article the author praised Bezos for raising the minimum wage without citing those who pressured him to do so like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and various labour leaders.
C: (0.989%) T: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and 8 other Senators sent Sundar Pichai a letter urging him to reclassify Google's army of temp workers as full-time employees (GOOG) - https://t.co/DxVcWq5HZJ https://t.co/n8aUBuDLHn
C: (0.995%) T: @davidhogg111 @JoeBiden @NRA Invite @ewarren   Elizabeth Warren, She WILL go!!!
C: (0.998%) T: The difference is that when a leftist ideologue shot up a baseball field, Elizabeth Warren did not tell the press that there were “very fine people on both sides” of that incident.
C: (0.968%) T: @NateStern @michaeljknowles https://t.co/2LO5OSapYh  Eric Swalwell, who pointed to his assault weapons confiscation program  President Elizabeth Warren signs a comprehensive bill that includes universal background checks, bans on assault weapons
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib The Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders
C: (0.998%) T: @NicolleDWallace 2nd are Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, John McCain, Elizabeth Warren, Beto, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan, Jeff Sessions, Mitt Romney, Robert Di Nero, Joe &amp; Mika, Hillary, Rosie O'Donnell I can go on.,... "people of color"?  Another fake left talking point. https://t.co/j10iELDCzB
C: (0.996%) T: @bradybuzz The shooter in Dayton was an Antifa supporter, a Democrat and was going to vote for Elizabeth Warren.  Does this shooting make Warren a White Supremacist?
C: (1.000%) T: @Beerus69420 @KamalaHarris Point out to me where Elizabeth Warren promoted physical violence like donnie does all the time https://t.co/SkBAR7VPOn
C: (1.000%) T: @HB_Brucey @Harry1T6 @AOC Are you serious? I’ve been hearing non-stop about how the kid from Dayton was an Elizabeth warren supporter, which lead everyone on the right to the conclusion that he was antifa, who are the real culprits. After the El Paso shooting, a Texas official said antifa isn’t welcome
C: (1.000%) T: @FlexFantastic If we hold to the age factor, bye bye Biden &amp; Bernie and we have Elizabeth Warren for President.
C: (0.983%) T: @PandasAndGaming "Everything is inherently political except for the motivations of the Dayton shooter who hated Trump and loved Elizabeth Warren."
C: (0.999%) T: @AOC Hey #occassionalcortex then what about the Dayton shooter that killed 9 people in the name of Elizabeth Warren? Does that make her racists as well? Or how about the Dallas police killed by BLM during #Obama admin? Is he racist too? #WalkAwayFromDemocratSocialists #Hypocrite
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump I can’t believe Elizabeth Warren caused that mass shooting in Dayton.
C: (0.993%) T: @cristela9 @Castro4Congress And let's not forget the ultra liberal Elizabeth Warren supporting democrat terrorist in Dayton, sweet cheeks.
C: (0.997%) T: Dream ticket: Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown.  Bonus: Connie Schultz is married to Sherrod and is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist. https://t.co/wdQksNrJpC
C: (1.000%) T: @thehill Flying under the radar for a front runner is an enviable position... it's probably Elizabeth Warren's race to lose on the Dem side and would do better than Hillary vs Trump  https://t.co/dv87W2NSvC
C: (1.000%) T: Hmmm. I thought attacking the Media was a serious offense against the First A. I guess, as usual, it all depends on who's doing it. Elizabeth Warren attacks Fox News with video, fundraising  https://t.co/YtCWhPWnHP
