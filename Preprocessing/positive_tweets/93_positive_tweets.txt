C: (0.987%) T: @piersmorgan @SebGorka Yes the Ohio shooter was a Leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.988%) T: @EWErickson @stuartpstevens Stu uses Amazon argument above?  So when Elizabeth Warren slams companies on Senate Floor by name: (Experian, Wells Fargo) did you speak out? No bc you are selective outrage due to your pure hatred of Trump, who neither of us voted for or like, but we can still think rationally!
C: (0.989%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx What would happen if someone published Elizabeth Warren's donor list and addresses since it was one of her Antifa supporters who shot up Dayton?  We would hear for weeks how it endangers you idiots.
C: (0.999%) T: @BetoORourke Bull üí© Francis. Trump is no more responsible for the tragedy in EL Paso than Elizabeth Warren is for the shooting in Dayton. STOP trying to get on the next debate stage on the backs of 22 of your former constituents. You are the worst kind of political hack. #ItsYourFaultFrancis
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Did Elizabeth Warren inspire the Ohio shooter? No and President Trump didn‚Äôt inspire the El Paso shooter.  Comments like this is exactly why no one backed your POTUS run. You‚Äôre a pitiful little man.
C: (1.000%) T: Kamala Harris hired a dream team of operatives. Joe Biden has solid establishment support. Bernie Sanders heads a volunteer army. And Juli√°n Castro is seen as a ‚Äúsleeper.‚Äù  But Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs campaign is getting most of the buzz by Nevada insiders  https://t.co/SkkwGsjcom
C: (1.000%) T: @nycsouthpaw @stableford Yes,  downplay the liberal, lefty, Democrat connection to mass shootings, but lie about Trump's conmection. Real good journalism. Dayton....Elizabeth Warren supporter. Steve Scalise shooter... Sanders supporter. Rand Paul attacker....lefty. but not important to mention.
C: (1.000%) T: @NickiSalcedo True story. I was almost named Elizabeth. I came that close to being Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: This is a great read:  https://t.co/IcVYot0s2n
C: (1.000%) T: @999zzzccc By your definition, since you support Elizabeth Warren and the Dayton Shooter was a Satanist and planned to vote for Elizabeth Warren that makes you &amp; her a Satanist.  https://t.co/V0lyJn0qhX
C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker Where are all these "white supremacists" that you keep dog whistling about? What about the other shooter that praises Elizabeth Warren and socialist policies like you? Are you and Elizabeth Warren to blame as well?
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera You mean the Elizabeth Warren supporter was clinging to Trump‚Äôs every word. You often sound like a fool but never more like one than now!!! https://t.co/utmliytFKn
C: (1.000%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera You mean the Elizabeth Warren supporter was clinging to Trump‚Äôs every word. You often sound like a fool but never more like one than now!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @13WHAM Funny, if the guy was a trump supporter you would have slammed the president and his supports. Since he was a antifa and Elizabeth Warren support you didn't mention it in this story. And you wonder why people don't trust the news
C: (1.000%) T: @poststar Did the NRA or an NRA member commit those shootings? I don't see this paper or anyone else in the media calling out Elizabeth Warren because the shooter in Dayton wanted to vote for her. Targeting those who had nothing to do with these crimes is what's helping to divide us more.
C: (0.814%) T: @SuneJack Just like the lives taken in Dayton Ohio was because of Elizabeth Warren. I‚Äôm with you on that.
C: (0.988%) T: @MissingMichiga1 @Coney70s @MSNBC @chrislhayes Not him. He is a Elizabeth Warren supporter. Bad luck. https://t.co/lMZFlT4t6p
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib Except one of them was an Elizabeth Warren loving libtard.
C: (1.000%) T: @ndrew_lawrence Both shooters were Left Wing, tho. And one claimed support of Elizabeth Warren. @ewarren
C: (0.992%) T: @DUANEALLEN So what are people who lie about their heritage?Who don‚Äôt want to protect their citizens and help our military ? What are you Elizabeth Warren? A politician who hides behind her fenced in house who also has armed body guards? Then tells me I‚Äôm racist.
C: (0.544%) T: @KamalaHarris You forgot Connor, is that because he was going to vote for Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @TeamCalvert ‚ÄúI am a capitalist...I believe in markets. What I don't believe in is theft, what I don't believe in is cheating...I love what markets can do, I love what functioning economies can do. They are what make us rich, they are what create opportunity. ‚Äú Elizabeth Warren Socialist.
C: (0.994%) T: Typical...if you cant legislate the 2nd Amendment away, why just tax the crap out of it. Because bad guys don't want to pay taxes right. #TaxationIsTheft   https://t.co/idPz2ieRK5
C: (0.997%) T: @NastyMindy Elizabeth Warren right now!
C: (1.000%) T: "Several former students who are Republicans declined to talk ... on the record precisely because they liked Elizabeth Warren so much and did not want to contribute to furthering her political prospects by speaking warmly of her."  https://t.co/s2rDIWwSgZ
