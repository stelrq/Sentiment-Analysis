C: (1.000%) T: @TexasJoeDuck @JbissellF @LennyGhoul @GovBillWeld @EvanMcMullin @justinamash No it didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. Hillary didn‚Äôt win.  And not voting for Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt mean I want 4 more years of Trump
C: (1.000%) T: @Newsweek @_mahnke It's not gonna be like "Ooo! Elizabeth Warren's president now! Let's give all our business back to the US!"  This will take a long long time to reverse, if ever.
C: (0.656%) T: Former Missouri Dem lawmaker, retired officer blasts Warren for tweet claiming Michael Brown was murdered https://t.co/gSAZVA68vT #FoxNews Her statement is so irresponsible &amp; inflammatory besides being blatantly false. She is either ignorant, negligent and/or lacks common sense.
C: (0.978%) T: @Langerhans_isle @OceanRooster @alfbennymedia @Alex__Katz Didn‚Äôt see that in part of her PLANS for climate change.   https://t.co/f3KsJTtxOR
C: (0.698%) T: Easy for you to do now that Elizabeth Warren loosened the lug nuts.  Tighty Righty, big boy. Tighty Righty!!! https://t.co/ezSyFcLDBj
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren is coming to the Twin Cities MN (Macalester College in St. Paul) next Monday 8/19!! https://t.co/Tj4F04YSR3
C: (1.000%) T: How the media sometimes loves to soft sell a headline about a cop raping an underage girl but can go hardcore on Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren is beyond me. The headline even makes it sound consensual, which is sick. https://t.co/fWcZ0Dq526
C: (1.000%) T: @LadyRedWave @Catherineannmc4 Elizabeth Warren Lied? that can't be true old pocahontas lied about her heritage to get a job and funding for her schooling when will she stop lying? never!
C: (0.987%) T: @TinaDuryea @Wonderbitch81 ‚ÄúThat means that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who did not speak before the group in their many visits this year, would not be considered.‚Äù C.f. https://t.co/6foUSbRJ3u
C: (1.000%) T: I've seen some people suggest Wilson should sue Warren &amp; Harris for defamation--but that'd be pointless, at least as I understand the law. You're allowed to draw an incorrect conclusion from publicly known facts, even if it differs from the official one. https://t.co/CfrodtumCD
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps Now if he said - you sound like Elizabeth Warren - thats a compliment !
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris You need to let that üí© for a catchphrase go. It‚Äôs as lame as Elizabeth Warren pretending to drink a beer with her husband.
C: (0.995%) T: @MarcusEdelstein Elizabeth Warren or whomever can squeak out a win over her.
C: (0.994%) T: They aren't getting the details wrong.   They said exactly what they meant to say. Because with people like them and at Vox facts don't matter.   Only the agenda matters.   Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris‚Äôs controversial Michael Brown tweets, explained https://t.co/mNhx8WhsBU
C: (0.989%) T: check out @germanrlopez incredibly stupid and Un-researched article. He clearly hasn‚Äôt watched @Stranger_fruit. It‚Äôs so libelous of both this journalist and @voxdotcom to allow this garbage on their site. I thought Fox News was about this stuff, not VOX. https://t.co/DtW19DJruz
C: (1.000%) T: @RWPUSA @ewarren @JoeBiden @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren lacks a simple, focused message.
C: (1.000%) T: @questionLibs @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders Elizabeth Warren slams college costs.... she made $400,000 a year for teaching ONE class.  Feds took over student loans under Obama in 2010.  NOW there's a HUGE problem....   And the Dems want to take over health care ü§£ü§£ü§£
C: (0.974%) T: @KamalaHarris You and Elizabeth Warren are disgusting! You prove daily how low you will go, never caring about who you hurt along the way. Demonic behavior!
C: (1.000%) T: @SebGorka For the same reason that Elizabeth Warren took a drink of beer and HRC had hot sauce! So that someone might mistake them for everyday Americans!
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I have no idea if Elizabeth Warren is going to win.  But she‚Äôs running a great campaign.  #Maddow #LastWord #MSNBC
C: (1.000%) T: @BrianZahnd So, like Elizabeth Warren then, as righteous ruler?  ;)  (at least on economic policy)
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow @donhum47 Elizabeth Warren tells around (1) truth per every (1,024) lies told.   Roughly around, what Warrens own DNA told. üòÜü§£üòÇ
C: (1.000%) T: @GeorgeWill One of us will vote for Elizabeth Warren if she gets the Democratic nomination. The other one is yours truly.
C: (1.000%) T: @VABVOX I can't honestly answer this poll as I want Elizabeth Warren to be president. She's 70 yrs old but sharp as a tack. Obviously others in that age group may have health issues. The fact that corrupt presidents (Trump) can write their own health reports is the problem, not the age.
C: (1.000%) T: Why does Elizabeth Warren fight more for African Americans than she does for Native American people, HER people! March 1, 1790The first U.S. Census count included slaves and free African-Americans, but Indians were not included.
