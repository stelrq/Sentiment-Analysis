C: (1.000%) T: “Being Native American has been part of my story I guess since the day I was born.”                            ....Elizabeth Warren  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Whatever!!!
C: (1.000%) T: “According to his[Daytona shooter’s]Twitter feed-which Twitter unhelpfully deleted but not before https://t.co/1xA5JRcrnI captured &amp; published excerpts-he could better be described as a satanist, socialist or Elizabeth Warren supporter.”  Twitter did what? https://t.co/A2503iavE2
C: (1.000%) T: ⁦@GeorgeWill⁩’s points on #nationalconservatism are excellent.   “...national conservatism is paternalistic populism...”  ‘National conservative’ policies are full of oxymorons https://t.co/dthPJqL3MD
C: (0.962%) T: @Polo_82fever Hahahahaha that's funny, Elizabeth Warren is a total imbecile, clearly looking for media attention because she is irrelevant!
C: (1.000%) T: @hrtablaze @DineshDSouza About as authentic as Elizabeth Warren swigging a beer or Hillary’s many different voice patterns speaking to rural people.  Truly fake.  Maybe even as fake as CNN.
C: (1.000%) T: @K_JeanPierre Is there a company Libs use that specializes in photo op pictures? AOC at the border. Elizabeth Warren at a lemonade stand. Beto tries so hard. &amp; then crowding a bunch of infants of difft skin tones in a small room while looking out a window at a US prez is priceless. #emptywords
C: (0.989%) T: @hopendreams @SenKamalaHarris Kamala Harris just sponsored with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren a "Green Card" bill to let Google hire from China and India.  Meanwhile 48% U.S. "STEM" Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math trained employable U.S. citizens do not have jobs.  This is your candidates.
C: (1.000%) T: @MBridegam @LemieuxLGM @jsundmanus Scott left out the fact Taibbi's written 2 full articles supporting Warren  "doesn't...like anything about women"🙄  Really? 👉https://t.co/VvFkWXklyO 👉https://t.co/KVKO0kyeSI 👉https://t.co/mjB9Tv8FNf 👉https://t.co/DxxfTYE3tR 👉https://t.co/QGHCdlhwmo 👉https://t.co/YxBpvn1wYd
C: (0.503%) T: @notMarkWoodall @JamesHesch2 @BetteMidler @Thirteen_IN I said Elizabeth Warren, not some “stupid nickname.”  You won’t concede that she lied about her heritage?
C: (1.000%) T: @brithume How dare Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren state factual information? Next they’re going to say that the sky is blue and water is wet. If you’re really worried about calming racial tension, you might want to focus your efforts on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. #BeBest
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Elizabeth Warren must first explain why she put 5 million working class students out of trade schools to divert their financial aid to Ivy League students
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren has a plan to reduce gun deaths by 80%! And that includes suicides, which often involve long-time legal gun owners, so background checks and AW bans won't matter. https://t.co/hOSr15RnnL
C: (0.725%) T: Presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren calls police murdering racists on Twitter - The Peoples Ledger https://t.co/dPoUEsgX25
C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump @ErinBurnett Why I don't listen to Zullo 1. The new fake Left hates the proletariat 2. Open Borders = Low Wages 3. NAFTA = no tariffs, anti-tariff = pro-NAFTA 4. Statistically, you're more likely to be killed by a Satan worshiping fan of Elizabeth Warren than have 1 honest Democrat senator
C: (1.000%) T: @Shrek_megusta @JackPosobiec So you support Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren? They both want to make most programs universal
C: (1.000%) T: @BusyPhilipps A man announces that a random stranger looks like Elizabeth Warren.  My question is... how many other people look like Elizabeth Warren?  Does she haunt his dreams too?  Maybe he should get this checked out?  He seems mighty triggered...
C: (1.000%) T: @PalimpsestMan @KamalaHarris I understand Elizabeth Warren calling it murder - she'll need to pander hard to do well in South Carolina. But Kamala Harris? I really don't get it, unless the Tulsi Gabbard torpedos about her record as a prosecutor really rocked her poll numbers. https://t.co/f0g5DlW0Pj
C: (1.000%) T: Look at this! Elizabeth Warren does understand that higher taxes for companies does hurt business. She also know if business is hurt, jobs are lost. So why do dems always want to raise taxes in business owners? Why do they trash @realDonaldTrump tax cut? https://t.co/7rOTjYVhYZ

C: (0.962%) T: @Garymit40382056 @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump @ErinBurnett Statistically, you are more likely to be killed by a Satan worshiping supporter of Elizabeth Warren (9 killed) than to hear Joe Biden talk for more than 60 seconds without saying something stupid.
C: (1.000%) T: @notMarkWoodall @JamesHesch2 @BetteMidler @Thirteen_IN Explain why you care so much about Trump’s lies and so little about Elizabeth Warren’s.  That’d help me learn.
C: (0.982%) T: Who’d they ask? Elizabeth Warren? https://t.co/YoLcQXTR59
