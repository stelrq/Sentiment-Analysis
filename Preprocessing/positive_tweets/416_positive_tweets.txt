C: (1.000%) T: @mdculham Really? Save for that one guy who shot up the congressional softball game, i can‚Äôt remember a single incident where investigators found FB or Twitter rants that celebrated Bernie Sanders of Elizabeth Warren. It‚Äôs all right-wing ideologies. Why do you think that‚Äôs so?
C: (1.000%) T: @strat_nick @JacksonvilleTom @daveweigel I like Elizabeth Warren. And I thought she did great on the debate stage. However, she has done little to convince me that she represents an overhaul in the power structure that prevents good ideas like Medicare for All from being passed. I‚Äôm still with Bernie.
C: (1.000%) T: Trump "has given aid and comfort to white supremacists" and "done the wink and a nod. He has talked about white supremacists as fine people. He's done everything he can to stir up racial conflict and hatred in this country," Warren said. https://t.co/LCeKVTae9Y
