C: (1.000%) T: @Alyssa_Milano @JoeBiden Literally every Dem candidate for office has been milking this situation for political gain. Elizabeth Warren even had the depravity of fundraising off of it. Not a peep from you. ü§î
C: (1.000%) T: @keithboykin @SUR_Indiana FIFY. You don't actually have to repeat his insults to get your main point across.  Trump today has attacked:  Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley Joe Biden Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Shepard Smith CNN The New York Times The Media

C: (0.996%) T: @SenWarren @WellsFargo MIC DROP! You are such a badass, Elizabeth Warren. I opened up a Wells Fargo account and am blown away by how good the customer service is. Maybe I have you to thank for this.
C: (1.000%) T: @AmericanEagl18 @agapaoflower @LionelMedia @BetoORourke @morningmika Now then, I told you Schizophrenia is a MENTAL disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. He is certifiably insane. He actually wrote a story about running over children...And Elizabeth Warren is in the same boat. She has a psychiatrist we should track down....
C: (1.000%) T: @gmulligan38 Its demeaning cause Elizabeth Warren is stealing is thunder. Looks like Warren is eating up his polling numbers after every debate.
C: (1.000%) T: @ABC @FiveThirtyEight Will the Ohio shooting change the way people talk about Elizabeth Warren?  This is more like a high school debate than real reporting.
C: (1.000%) T: @NRCC Actually, Elizabeth Warren seems to have political issues quite under control and aims to help the majority of Americans, not mostly the richest people and those who think women should not be able to decide for themselves on their reproductive rights.
C: (0.994%) T: Yes, Trump is a white supremacist, Elizabeth Warren tells NYT https://t.co/pfFAbuwZaK https://t.co/ZrnrPeSg1D
C: (1.000%) T: @aimeeterese in response the jacobin moves towards an elizabeth warren endorsement to fight toxic masculinity and show much they care about workers
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren Compared Abortion to ‚ÄúGetting Your Tonsils Out‚Äù https://t.co/9oazt04wwl How inhuman ,she believes in murder,welcome to a person with no conscience.Does she realize if her mom had aborted her,she wouldn‚Äôt be alive todayü§î
C: (1.000%) T: Candidate Crossover: Sen. Elizabeth Warren shares more donors with her Democratic rivals than anyone else in the 2020 race. Most of Ms. Warren's crossover is with Sens. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. https://t.co/iCWI3GvsqJ
C: (1.000%) T: @TransformedMe @NancyHWeaver1 @_BirthByFire Honestly, after her loyalty to the Clinton‚Äôs/MIC/Bibi has been examined, maybe it‚Äôs best to give her a backseat? Third Way &amp; Wall St support? Mmmkay. üòèhttps://t.co/iAozs5zJOG
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren wants to know which issues to focus on in order to build a movement that she can lead.  Which seems kind of backwards, as I'm supporting a candidate who's already passionate about the issues that I care about.  Or maybe this tweet is really just about the money.
C: (1.000%) T: President Elizabeth Warren will transform America. She could well be the FDR of our time. https://t.co/xPrQ7S91ez
C: (1.000%) T: Some facts have already surfaced about Dayton Shooter:  the fact that he was a registered Democrat, had a political love affair of sorts w/ Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Satan, and thought Antifa was the best thing to happen to America! Connor Betts was a LEFTIST!
C: (0.698%) T: BREAKING: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren tells the New York Times she believes President Trump is a white supremacist https://t.co/WeRskUOUiV
C: (1.000%) T: @RayAllenInMN @FBI The Dayton shooter was a Leftist who worshipped Elizabeth Warren. Anyone with Bernie, Hillary, or Elizabeth plastered all over their profile needs to be reported to twitter and the fbi. These could be the next mass shooters for real. iS tHaT hOw ThIs WoRkS?
C: (1.000%) T: @McFaul @11thHour By contrast, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign considers pets important to her campaign. Her website offers the usual t-shirts and stuff, but also a kitty collar and a fashionable doggie bandana, encouraging us to help Bailey become "First Dog". https://t.co/zOphxQzzcY
C: (1.000%) T: Twitter feed shows Dayton shooter was leftist and supported Elizabeth Warren - https://t.co/2SItQ9pc9t
C: (0.738%) T: @seagullsquirrel @realDonaldTrump When did Trump hold a racist rally or use hate rhetoric? Do you feel the same way about Elizabeth Warren? The #Dayton shooter was a supporter of her.
