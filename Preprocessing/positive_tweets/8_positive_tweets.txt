C: (0.994%) T: Elizabeth Warren calls Trump a white supremacist https://t.co/3bScRhrhei
C: (1.000%) T: @JessicaMeskus There's no point in acting emotionally so quickly. Study it, agree to certain acts to help the situation rather than try to disarm law abiding Americans. Elizabeth Warren said she would send troops out to confiscate all guns! Good luck with That! That's communist! But, so is she!
C: (0.988%) T: @semcc2 And for the record-you skipped over his support for Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @fairywench_1 @OGintheOP Isn't the 1/3 thing a recommendation from the mortgage industry - kind of like 2 months salary for an engagement ring? I try to keep all my required expenses (rent-healthcare-groceries-car, etc at 50 or less of post-tax income). That recommendation is from Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.998%) T: Elizabeth Warren Gains on Joe Biden After Second Debate   The candidates head to the Iowa State Fair this weekend.   Will their stump speeches move the needle?   https://t.co/xmZBK8aBCL https://t.co/miUgv44Wjt
C: (1.000%) T: Democrats believe Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren could beat Donald Trump in 2020. You know: old white people. Irony is that it is likely Black voters that would make it happen. And two of them probably need to be on ticket. Just saying. https://t.co/juuhKLbaqH
C: (1.000%) T: I need a good laugh. Anyone know if there is video anywhere of Elizabeth Warren dancing? Perhaps at a wedding reception? If you can produce authentic video of her dancing to "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang, I will soil myself. I'll settle for Macarena video also.

C: (0.997%) T: The fact that Elizabeth Warren stood up and clapped when trump said America will never be a socialist country and endorsed Clinton during the primaries instead of Bernie, should tell you enough about her. I don‚Äôt trust her. https://t.co/ogESE6XPIT
C: (1.000%) T: @tooth_rep @Jim_Jordan The Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren and Antifa supporter, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre ignoring those facts.
C: (0.986%) T: @RudyGiuliani If a list was released which named me as a donor to Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris, I would be proud.  Why aren't tRump donors?
C: (1.000%) T: @checkmatestate @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren DO they have a city permit and a food handlers permit or is Elizabeth Warren giving them a free pass because they are white???
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is my favorite candidate. I love Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/GQMtqasVjF
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren must know by now that @realDonaldTrump never spoke about ‚Äúwhite supremacists as fine people.‚Äù In fact, he said just the opposite. Given her willingness to lie about her heritage to advance her career, why am I surprised? #Pocahontas https://t.co/rSWM2ZdMoZ
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Bahahaha! Just strolling along, minding my own business aaaand üí•BAMüí• Elizabeth Warren was standing there buying lemonade!
C: (0.995%) T: @KimNorvellDMR Thirsty on the road? Elizabeth Warren has a stand for that.
C: (0.560%) T: @FrankConniff No. I'm a woman who will not vote for Warren. She has waffled greatly on Medicare4All so I know she won't fight for it &amp; she's dishonest--while pretending to be against Trump, she votes that lunatic billions more for weapons &amp; war, that's a deal breaker. https://t.co/0knff8S30G
C: (0.998%) T: Periodic reminder: Elizabeth Warren isn't just better at this, she is the BEST at it. https://t.co/9KvFcdq9kL
C: (1.000%) T: @Pksoze Bad tie? She is on record praising him as her mentor! How do you explain the Dayton shooters motive? He said he was a big fan of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Do we blame Warren for his disgusting act? No!
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 @dwaynechadwick4 Elizabeth Warren AKA Pocahontas is a sick LIAR! Anyone that lies about there heritage will lie about anything. She‚Äôs a Socialist &amp; must have her wings clipped or this chicken crapper will get totally out of hand. If you believe anything this Socialist says you‚Äôre as dumb as her!
C: (1.000%) T: He was an avowed leftist, Elizabeth Warren fan, #Assholes https://t.co/OGL9zUJcsS
C: (1.000%) T: @NikalKatha @AmyMcGrathKY Why is it Trump in your mind should be crucified in the streets &amp; Bernie &amp; Elizabeth Warren get an exemption pass? We've had more than several  attacks by their supporters now Their words matter as well, you don't think they tell lies to divide? Use emotion and race for politics?
C: (1.000%) T: People who are sorry they were born white and/or believe in white supremacy should be the contributors for the reparations in Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs plan.  That should help them to feel better about themselves. https://t.co/zKosMXuLDj
