C: (1.000%) T: I think it‚Äôs diff this time.   Elizabeth Warren n Kamala not gonna get love like Barak did.  Barack was a once in a lifetime blessing for da DNC üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ https://t.co/vzIsHeVXH7
C: (0.598%) T: @BernieSanders Ban dems with guns, Elizabeth Warren followers, Bernie Followers.   Both have proven to have dangerous people following them. Warren with Dayton shooter and Bernie bros shot up GOP congressmen on the ball field.  #NOGUNSFORDEMS
C: (1.000%) T: @TimMurtaugh What‚Äôs low about sharing public information? Why would anyone be upset about supporting Trump or anyone knowing about it if they agree with what he stands for? I‚Äôm fine for everyone to know I‚Äôve donated to Dems, including Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: May Elizabeth Warren 'reign' supreme when all is said and done and the dust settle. She is one woman on the mark. https://t.co/3MP05wPuNq
C: (1.000%) T: @LoniLove Racism and also ideology .. There have been mass shooters who support Bernie or Elizabeth Warren I think we need to call out terrorism period
C: (0.988%) T: @thekjohnston Elizabeth Warren stan who's here to represent positivity.
C: (1.000%) T: @StephBenton1972 @GeorgeTakei If you're so quick to blame potus and the shooter supported Elizabeth warren, then why isn't the blame put on her?  You people really make no sense, but then I see the lies in the media and I dont need to wonder why things are the way they are.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is the kind of teacher I want to be.   (also a mention of @Calvin_Uni though I can't say "alma mater of Betsy DeVos" is how we like to be known) https://t.co/6a95fxdZcY
C: (1.000%) T: @Noe_812 And to say that trump is inspiring mass shooters means that you believe the biased media that blames trump unjustly for. If you didn‚Äôt know there was a shooting recently in Ohio and the person was a leftist extremist who cited Elizabeth warren... so is she to blame???
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren you have allowed 20 million plus people to enter our country illegality then say "no on is above the law"
C: (0.985%) T: @franmalayeri Why didnt he doxx Elizabeth warren??  https://t.co/qp5lXPmMrU
C: (1.000%) T: @kentnish @mattdpearce All kidding aside, offering cat photos as part of your daily emailed news round up for subscribers would probably net you some subscriptions. Elizabeth Warren tweets photos of her dog as an incentive to get people to sign up for SMS.
C: (0.988%) T: @SenWarren Using Cory Booker‚Äôs logic, Elizabeth Warren should cancel all of her rallies because the Dayton, Ohio mass shooter was a hardcore leftist member of Antifa who praised Pocahontas Warren. @Ilhan @AOC @RashidaTlaib this is what your all rhetoric causes #Hate #Violence
C: (0.988%) T: @ImNotOwned @dhanuraashi @nerdythor @MattBruenig @NateSilver538 supporting Elizabeth Warren to own the Berners
C: (1.000%) T: To those honking Elizabeth Warren as a genius with her myriad plans, please note.  She intends to pay for them by rolling back the Liar Trump tax breaks for billionaires.  Small problem Liz.  That ballooned the deficit by trillions so it's money owed.  Can't spend what's owed
C: (0.988%) T: @AOC The SOCIALIST shooter that loved Elizabeth Warren, and the other confused ‚Äúright winger‚Äù shooter with heavy SOCIALIST views on the environment and Universal Basic Income, are exactly why we need to fully reject SOCIALISM!
C: (1.000%) T: Nice article, so well written Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs Classroom Strategy - #NewYorkMagazine #warren  https://t.co/b52jqk86Yb
C: (1.000%) T: @sirDukeDevin I definitely heard Elizabeth Warren say she would prosecute anyone that broke laws dealing with children. I wouldn't be surprised if she hasn't promised to reunite families.
C: (0.731%) T: Okay the Dayton Ohio shooter wasn't Elizabeth Warren follower so does that make her a racist?
C: (1.000%) T: Yes, the Dayton shooter was a Democratic Socialist who supported Elizabeth Warren. The El Paso shooter was a Republican who supports Donald Trump. But only one of them killed in the name of their beliefs. This is what separates a mass murderer from a terrorist.
C: (0.996%) T: @RyanAFournier That is the worst part. It is why they are going on about El Paso and silent about Dayton. Elizabeth Warren is more responsible for Dayton than Trump is for El Paso if you try to follow their ridiculously flawed logic.
C: (1.000%) T: This profile made me somehow love @ewarren even more and also love teaching more and also cry. @rtraister is a brilliant writer and EW is getting all my donation money.  https://t.co/yDrPlkBhHU
C: (0.837%) T: @BillKristol I really like Pete Buttigieg. I like Elizabeth Warren too but I am worried about the Medicare for All and people in the Rust belt getting worried and not voting for the presidential candidate on election day.
C: (1.000%) T: Question: Who are those sponsoring,encouraging violence against PRESIDENT Trump and US,his supporters since 2016!? There are NUMEROUS of public example,almost un a daily basis of that aberrantes &amp; criminal behavior by the leftist Democrats in,&amp; out of Gov. https://t.co/OXuYP3FGuP
C: (1.000%) T: @erinturmelle Using Cory Booker‚Äôs logic, Elizabeth Warren should cancel all of her rallies because the Dayton, Ohio mass shooter was a hardcore leftist member of Antifa who praised Pocahontas Warren.  You losers
