C: (1.000%) T: @tribelaw He didn’t cause the murders no more than your words will cause someone to go out and kill someone. You’re not blaming Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders &amp; AOC for the Murders in Ohio so that proves you’re a HYPOCRITE &amp; using the children to make a Point. Prayers for the families
C: (1.000%) T: Morning Consult poll of early states:  Joe Biden 35% Bernie Sanders 18% Elizabeth Warren 11%  Then the next four candidates tied at 6%: Cory Booker  Pete Buttigieg  Kamala Harris Tom Steyer  https://t.co/W6L81l793K
C: (0.988%) T: @Myrmecos @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The Dayton shooter loved Elizabeth Warren,  and quoted her.
C: (1.000%) T: @MarcusEdelstein Elizabeth Warren is my first choice but whoever gets the nom gets my vote (as it has always been).
C: (1.000%) T: i feel like i’m about as stable as elizabeth warren’s grandson’s strawberry shortcake atm
C: (0.680%) T: @ewarren Pretty sad when even liberal media says you are a liar. https://t.co/g2vwZzeOz1
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Notice how Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren aren't on this list.  That's the point of being behind Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  Remember when Trump was going to get us out of the Afghan war on Day 1?  Yeah that's what I thought.
C: (1.000%) T: @Wonderbitch81 @Alysson @Planet_Phoebe @Drivebythinker @RogueOpsCommand @TheMarschallin @WolvesforKamala I'll say it.  Elizabeth Warren's candidacy gives white people an excuse to be self righteously racist and think they can just get away with it.  MAGA has been doing it for years with her right out loud.  Now her fans are out here geting a taste for doing it. And they like it.

C: (1.000%) T: Two Dem POTUS candidates, @KamalaHarris and @ewarren Elizabeth Warren, are so racist they believe black Americans either never read and listen to the news; are too stupid to understand it; or are as racist as they are.  https://t.co/lFM30bxf4A
C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris Even liberal media say this is bullsh*t...... https://t.co/g2vwZzeOz1
C: (1.000%) T: @but_rly_tho @deathanchor @getongab @JRubinBlogger I can’t believe you people blame Gab or 8chan, I wasn’t a big fan of 8chan but even I can tell they are not responsible  To you hold Elizabeth Warren accountable for her inspiration of a mass shooting, no but you hold trump accountable  Do you hold twitter no you hold Gab
C: (0.949%) T: @FiveThirtyEight Omg really, #BabyhandsMcPuffyface?  Elizabeth Warren could take him with both hands tied behind her back!

C: (1.000%) T: @dannyp_sax @GH12K4 @BaudToTears @MarcFour71 @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders And people like Elizabeth Warren weren’t getting paid 400k to teach 1 class.... As easy to obtain government backed loans became more available, tuition got more expensive... imagine that, government making things more expensive... weird...
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidAFrench @brithume 1/ Individual situations do not always match systemic patterns.  I honestly expect more from Elizabeth Warren since as an academic she could get the importance of footnotes.  If high school students can handle the truth of the Boston massacre, then the adult population
C: (1.000%) T: @AngryBlackLady @ProudResister I don't think there are enough people in this country that want what Elizabeth Warren is selling.Period. There there's some shitt for you youngster.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren I guess you could say Elizabeth Warren's tweet is controversial &amp; provocative. And yes, it's true the police officer who killed Michael Brown was cleared. I just wish there wasn't all this research on police interaction with Black Americans available. https://t.co/VElbXawpTg
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren: gotta be more approachable than Hillary gotta think outside the box Also Elizabeth Warren: LOOK AT THIS SOGGY MOUND https://t.co/0JKvWqALuB
C: (1.000%) T: @Goss30Goss @sdr_medco I won't vote for Bernie Sanders. I won't vote for Joe Biden. I will vote for Kamala Harris. I won’t vote for Elizabeth Warren.  In the Democratic Primary.   That being said, who ever wins the nomination, I WILL vote Blue.  Trump can't have 4 more yrs. Hope everyone is on board.
C: (0.995%) T: @WilsonOfficer please sue Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren get a lawyer and sue! That is liable
C: (1.000%) T: Can we just vote for all of the Democrats? Like can they all be president? But whoever has the better plan for everything is whose plan we use oh wait I guess that’s just Elizabeth Warren for everything anyway nevermind.
C: (1.000%) T: Climate change happens all the time but for 2020 you have got all the tools you need victorious at Elizabeth Warren
