C: (1.000%) T: Officer Wilson was attacked by a 292 lbs man, fought for his life, and defended himself so that he could go home to his family.  He was cleared by every investigation at every level of government.  Shame on you Elizabeth Warren, shame on you. https://t.co/YHEzCiRhmw
C: (0.992%) T: @KamalaHarris Lie! Let’s look at the truth under Obama! OUCH! Brit Hume obliterates Elizabeth Warren's claim Michael Brown was 'murdered' (and uses Obama's DOJ to do so) https://t.co/89m3bvXWmk
C: (1.000%) T: That fact that we tolerate the manufacture of these weapons should infuriate any human. Taxing these weapons means only rich white people will have them. Elizabeth Warren unveils gun control plan that pushes for higher taxes on firearms and bullets https://t.co/v7AvAPF5uJ

C: (0.998%) T: Me: this is a question for all candidates. What is your plan for addressing the One Direction hiatus?   The moderator: ma’am, I don’t thin-  Elizabeth Warren: wait. let her speak.
C: (1.000%) T: Why is the solution always taxes? This way only the rich nutjobs will have guns. Also implies only the poor are mass murderers. How about we ban civilian ownership of military weapons? https://t.co/jY384Y1TQY
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren claims Michael Brown was 'murdered.' The response she got on Twitter wasn't pretty. - TheBlaze https://t.co/qRbgKKoFgr
C: (1.000%) T: @FakeDanWeber As a man, probably considered a somewhat moderate Democrat, Elizabeth Warren makes my skin crawl. And I can't even identify for you what exactly it is. But I see her as sort of a not pro-man candidate. https://t.co/46pJqMcZLV
C: (1.000%) T: @GhostTrumps Just as Bernie Sanders had nothing to do with the shooting of Steve Scalise, and Elizabeth Warren had nothing to do with the Dayton shooting.

C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump I agree that background checks are required but not for political reasons. If you listen to the democratic blather they would apply this to anyone that does not agree with their communistic agenda.  What if we had that phony Elizabeth Warren in the white house.  Scary!

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is surging. This one big question looms over her. - The Washington Post  This whole thing is fascinating. Her perceived electability among Dems is almost more important than her actual electability. https://t.co/aoF3AAXWBJ
