C: (0.994%) T: My car is named Elizabeth Warren, because it's white and says it's Cherokee. https://t.co/bBDZ0xufeP https://t.co/TAUdbhi2ND
C: (1.000%) T: @Ange_Amene The faculty who hired her have said they believed her to be a white woman. That she claimed to be NA is true and was wrong, but to call her a “diversity hire” does not fit with the historical record (it’s also a term that dog whistles for me...?).  https://t.co/yEUnv0CiFm
C: (1.000%) T: @wisdomofsoloman @bennyjohnson I'm not a Democrat, so I don't care, but I wonder what Elizabeth Warren has ever said that could be construed as an incitement to violence?

C: (1.000%) T: (1/3) Finally read this fluff article. @ewarren has a lovely personal story and is probably a great professor!  So many of my colleagues (mostly political science profs) have shared and gushed over this story, which is really alarming and disappointing. https://t.co/nLfge6h6YV
C: (1.000%) T: "Elizabeth Warren has laid out her plan to address gun violence, with an ambitious goal for her presidency if she wins in 2020: reducing gun deaths by 80% https://t.co/itWY6Mi58n"
C: (1.000%) T: @MemeR @DybbukStay Elizabeth Warren has a solid gun control plan. I RTed its first tweet this morning.  I want to live in a Warren administration. She makes sense.

C: (0.995%) T: @GKeile @teamcombover16 @ewarren Elizabeth Warren’s regard for the #Truth is rock bottom, and she demonstrates that fact, again with her false and invidious reference to Michael Brown’s death. She looks like #ChurchLady but she’s a lying, self serving, serpent who’d destroy the #USA to take on power. #WalkAway
C: (0.964%) T: @JamesEHiggins @AnnCoulter Michael Brown was a thug and a criminal. The narrative by Pocahontas-Elizabeth Warren just implies that police just randomly went after Michael Brown and shot him. That is not the true story.  Michael was found to steal from a store and shoved the shop owner. Videos are available
C: (0.996%) T: @AuntSophie1 @notcapnamerica @ewarren This is not correct.   https://t.co/HSn2Nlg9PR https://t.co/0oSv9EdXAJ
C: (1.000%) T: @constitionalis2 @SenGillibrand If you think this one is bad, you should go see Elizabeth Warren's tweet

C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson Yeah it's totally fine for a pundit on MSNBC to say, 'Bernie makes her skin crawl'. Corporate media attacks Bernie daily. Are you kidding me with this shit? If anyone said that about Elizabeth Warren you better be damn sure her supporters would be pissed off.  You're disgusting.
C: (1.000%) T: @LeningradGothic @FredTJoseph Better healthcare &amp; no tax cuts for the rich? No you just regurgitated Elizabeth Warren’s scripted talking point. What working ppl want is their entire paychecks. They don’t want to pay for reparations or healthcare for illegals. They aren’t going to overlook those things.

C: (1.000%) T: I think that Elizabeth Warren should be the favorite to win the primary
C: (0.988%) T: @realDonaldTrump Straight up PANIC. You’re too chickenshit to debate ANY of the Dems. Debate Elizabeth Warren. I DARE YOU. FAT BALD LOSER
C: (1.000%) T: So like every “good” Democrat Elizabeth Warren feels she has to RE-TRY the one already tried and vindicated. Sound familiar? https://t.co/qHGYlvIWu5
C: (1.000%) T: @AnnCoulter This is a truly shocking.  Elizabeth Warren accuses Officer Darren Wilson of "murder."   Never was any shooting so thoroughly investigated -- by the feds, the state and the media.  Wilson was totally vindicated. He should sue.
C: (0.675%) T: @MichaelCellucc1 @RealSaavedra Oh believe me I know. Elizabeth Warren unfortunately is my Senator sorry America.
C: (1.000%) T: With a goal of reducing gun-related deaths by 80%, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren just promised to sign comprehensive gun control legislation in the first 100 days in office, if she's elected president. #GunSenseForum   https://t.co/EMLVCaU5BP
C: (1.000%) T: Warren was an odd duck at Harvard, not just because she was one of only a handful of female professors; she was also among the only faculty whose degree had been issued by a public university. https://t.co/4NReOBwSq6
