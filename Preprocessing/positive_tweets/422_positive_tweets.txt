C: (0.601%) T: @WordswithSteph @IcelandicMetis @Scaramucci I am just skeptical of what help he can provide. After all, he also said on Bill Maher that if Elizabeth Warren wins the nomination, Trump will win forty states. I mean, c'mon! The man's a fool when he tries to be a commentator.

C: (0.983%) T: @ewarren Today i was asked if Elizabeth Warren was an Indian. I said yes. We know both are a lie!
C: (0.583%) T: @DavidJHarrisJr Elizabeth Warren will pander, lie, say anything for power including lying about being an indigenous person for her own gain.She is stoking racism and division to increase her appeal to minorities.Her plans will destroy our jobs,our economy,and our healthcare.We will all be broke.
C: (0.968%) T: @Wonderbitch81 Every time I see she apologized already it's a knife twisting in the back of Natives. https://t.co/bbk2Fj65eS
C: (0.967%) T: Someone should tell @ElizabethWarren that the NRA is a civil rights org.Citizen led,civil rights org.Warren calls for higher taxes, NRA investigation as part of gun control plan  https://t.co/b2YU9vsWEL
C: (1.000%) T: @rB777ftw @ChrisDJackson @ewarren It‚Äôs hilarious you think a Democrat who isn‚Äôt even that popular in Massachusetts can win the Midwest or the Sunbelt against Trump. Trump will beat her in a Mondale-style rout. https://t.co/vQvyHqgLkq
C: (1.000%) T: @AsterBerenbos @xfilesdiaries @DanaScully0709 @SlippinMickeys Elizabeth Warren is a Democrat running from President.  In the tweet she states that she is standing with the activists and the people of Ferguson.  Mitch tells her maybe she wasn't paying attention.  I'm not sure what she wasn't paying attention to...?
C: (1.000%) T: @SaphianaZ Dayton was carried out by an Elizabeth Warren fan, a gun control advocate that wanted far left government.
C: (0.997%) T: @ByronYork Goody, a right wing FOX ‚ÄúNews‚Äù contributor gives his 2 cents on Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @LisaMarieBoothe @JudgeJeanine Please remind the guy you debated the El Paso shooter targeted Mexicans because he was a #ClimateChange zealot &amp; wanted to reduce population. He specifically said his ideology predated Trump. Dayton shooter used specific language as Elizabeth Warren for his ideology: socialism!
C: (0.988%) T: @7777Beto7777 @auntieshay0304 Isn‚Äôt that a picture of Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @SenTedCruz      Dayton shooter supported Gun Control and Socialism.  No surprise. https://t.co/kmbYSeixni

C: (0.997%) T: @cher A registered Democrat Elizabeth Warren supporter and Antififa terrorist as well as a Satanist. STFU https://t.co/KRGoA5kqs0
C: (1.000%) T: @HouseGOP      Dayton shooter supported Gun Control and Socialism.  No surprise. https://t.co/kmbYSeixni
C: (0.987%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ As a TX voter I am stunned by the false equivalency you posit. Elizabeth Warren has not used racist terms, hate speech, misogyny, xenophobia to de-humanize or marginalize others. @POTUS has done all of that &amp; encouraged white supremacy.  #VoteHegar not #Cornyn
C: (1.000%) T: @nefariousnobody @DrEstella @charliekirk11 @ewarren Yes he stated it online he supported Elizabeth Warrenüá∫üá∏
C: (1.000%) T: @DanStapleton "Seeing some of that same language used by Donald Trump referenced in the disturbed manifestos" let's ignore the Antifa guy who tried firebombing and the Ohio shooter who used Elizabeth Warren language, I know pretending libs only say great things ruins your narrative
C: (1.000%) T: @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre being silly. The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan and posted leftist stuff.
C: (1.000%) T: @LM_Texas_ @BillOReilly Nothing to say about the Dayton shooter who was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and an avowed socialist? No, I didn't think you did.
C: (1.000%) T: @SarahEl14966673 You may want to rethink that since Ohio was inspired by Elizabeth Warren and Texas was inspired by AOC. Their manifestos used slot of the same language they use.
C: (0.998%) T: @ewarren The person responsible for the murders in Ohio was a huge Elizabeth Warren supporter and yet you have the nerve  to blame President Trump for what your supporter did. Stop the blame game and stop with your horrid hate speech all the time. I hope you never get elected!
C: (0.982%) T: @marklevinshow You're a liar. "The account retweeted messages supporting Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren." https://t.co/wnsMltnkfc
