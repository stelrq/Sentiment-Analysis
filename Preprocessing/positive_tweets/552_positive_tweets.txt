C: (0.994%) T: @MSNBC Blaming trump for El Paso is like blaming Elizabeth Warren for the Ohio shooter.. enough of the fake news
C: (1.000%) T: I canâ€™t tolerate liars from right, left or center. Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Lied about Ferguson &amp; Michael Brown | National Review https://t.co/0lj1epZCOH
C: (1.000%) T: @Repr00f @ewarren You mean, like, Elizabeth Warren???? And possibly those who won't take a risk of losing all they have as they start a new venture or implement a new idea and then resent those who do and succeed?  Those leeches? How about the leeches who think their existence is God's gift to us?
C: (0.985%) T: Elizabeth Warren has been talking a lot about the need for "big, structural change."  In a wide-ranging interview with the NPR Politics Podcast and @IowaPublicRadio, she discussed her gun control plan, her faith and President Trump's rhetoric on race. https://t.co/gYDx7WJtjo
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Everyone: that's nice  Fox News: Strawberries are expensive ergo Burgeoisie... They are also red so Communist!  Headline: Elizabeth Warren, Communist member of the elite, makes deluxe desert for privileged family while claiming to worry about the way illegals are treated by ICE!
C: (1.000%) T: @MathiasSundin @Horace_Badun @NateSilver538 Yes, and a few million dollars in Elizabeth Warren ads explaining that China stopped buying American soybeans and started buying from Russia instead will make it even worse.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren made $400,000 to teach one law school class which is part of the reason that Harvard Law School is exorbitantly expensive (an issue that she wants to resolve by taxing average Americans to forgive student debt). Why didnâ€™t she take less to help her students?
C: (1.000%) T: @ChuckCallesto So when is the left going to call out Elizabeth Warren for stealing heritage for personal gain and profit. That is worse than blackface.
C: (1.000%) T: @washingtonpost No, you canâ€™t promise free this and free that and be able to deliver. Bernie and Elizabeth Warren which I admire are promising the moon and the stars.
C: (1.000%) T: @ethan_harwood @NateSilver538 We like Elizabeth Warren. She's more progressive than Bernie and actually has plans that she can explain.
C: (0.987%) T: @dan_geldon @ewarren I agree!!  That is why I am for Elizabeth Warren 2020.
C: (1.000%) T: @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders But that being said bud, Bernie is not a god. Why @ewarren even has a plan for that. https://t.co/7wLeb70IXN
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren needs to rethink her plan for U.S. trade deals with developing nations, @Noahpinion writes (via @bopinion) https://t.co/cEN0iMiNtp
C: (1.000%) T: @newtgingrich Kamala Harris, will be the best bet, for All of Americans, she respects ICE, U.S.BORDER Police, and, the, Federalies.  Elizabeth Warren, has, no Respect for anymore or anything.  HOWEVER, likes to wave, her arms around, ðŸ˜Ž
C: (1.000%) T: Is anyone surprised? "MSNBC, CNN, and other major media outlets have largely ignored false claims by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) that Michael Brown was "murdered" by a white policeman in 2014..." https://t.co/WWtZClr3lY
C: (1.000%) T: Interestingly, Elizabeth Warren is able to both establish human connections with voters *and* champion ideas. #walkandchewgum https://t.co/5EA4vN4882
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Jesus Christ you old fraud and you used to be the supreme Court judge in Texas? No wonder the rest of the legal world laughs at pecedents set in  Texas. Did Elizabeth Warren talk about an invasion of immigrants did she laugh when someone suggested shooting them? Trump did
C: (0.989%) T: Iâ€™m with Elizabeth Warren. This sealed the deal for me. https://t.co/zCI39aUx6S
C: (1.000%) T: imagine thinking elizabeth warren is the best choice for our nation ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¥´
C: (1.000%) T: Just fell down a weird internet hole and found that Bette Midler and Paul Rudd are Elizabeth Warren fans, which is pretty great. https://t.co/XU9UIZQH2n
C: (1.000%) T: @repjohnlewis That is a bunch of dung. President Trump did nothing to cause this situation. Congress failure to secure the border caused one, Elizabeth Warren caused the other. Read the manifeato!
C: (1.000%) T: @CNN @CNNOpinion You have to be a really weak minded individual to blame the president for people who commit mass shootings. Senators did not blame Bernie Sanders for the ball field shooting, Senators didn't blame Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooting. Senators only blame potus. Sad &amp; pathetic
C: (1.000%) T: @tariqnasheed I think they are downplaying cuz he loved Elizabeth Warren &amp; hated Trump....doesnâ€™t fit the narrative.
C: (0.983%) T: Shouldn't people be arrested for theating people who don't think the way they do. Elizabeth Warren was fundraising the next day after people dying and spewing lies. Beto is unhinged like a 15 yr old, pure hate! Juan and AOC should be ashamed and stop their lies and hatefulness. https://t.co/UjMquEBEWh
C: (1.000%) T: @GainesvilleSun You conveniently failed to mention that he was an Elizabeth Warren fan and Democratic socialist.
