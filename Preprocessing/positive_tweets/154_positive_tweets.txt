C: (1.000%) T: The #DaytonShooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren, was connected to #ANTIFA, and was into satanism.  The #ElPaso shooter originally had social media indicating he was a #Democrat.  Neither had these "White National Terrorist" aspects that you people are making up.  Sick. https://t.co/tlPKAdzy7a
C: (1.000%) T: @craignewmark @jayrosen_nyu What there is the fact that they only let Elizabeth Warren on the air once a year, yet we get weekly conversations with the neo fascist Jonathan Goldberg at the white supremacist @nro.

C: (0.807%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl Dont forget to the same for Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren since she caused the murders in Dayton, right??? https://t.co/pyfzjekZib
C: (1.000%) T: Sen. Elizabeth Warren calls Fox News on Sunday a hate machine and responsible for the El Paso, Texas, mass shooting.  She tweeted: ‚ÄúWe need to call out Fox News as a hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists."
C: (1.000%) T: @RepMaxineWaters You do know it was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, not an NRA member, who did the shooting in Ohio, right? Grow a clue. #obvious #dumbass

C: (1.000%) T: Poll: Dems say Warren reigned in 2nd primary debates #NewsGrit https://t.co/jQvbV4i4Q8
C: (0.530%) T: @rwzh_ @freddoso @walterolson Yeah, Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs supporter‚Äôs are very civil... oh wait, Dayton!
C: (1.000%) T: @dorgal @politico And the Dayton shooter was liberal and cited Elizabeth warren and Bernie. Same thing
C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 somebody needs to dig into E Warrens past, very deep. She‚Äôs corrupt, a liar, a cheater and will say anything for a vote. Elizabeth Warren is pitiful. We have to vote these stupid people out of office, all of them.
C: (0.995%) T: @Nathan_2018 But nobody‚Äôs talkin bout the Elizabeth Warren Antifa supporter who committed the act in DaytonüëÄ
C: (0.988%) T: Dayton Mass Murderer Was a Socialist Democrat Who Loved Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders https://t.co/DfsGmtxSrd
C: (1.000%) T: @TomSteyer Demonizing congress right now is not a good idea. Take your wealth and support Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @sairasameerarao 78% of these mass murders are done by democrats! The one is Texas was a registered democrat,&amp;the one in Ohio praised Elizabeth Warren &amp; believed in democrat ideas. FBI studies show those that do this have red flags that people ignore that would prevent this. Mental Health is key!
C: (0.527%) T: @KarenSm96080 @DawnMSchnake @socialistonion @charliekirk11 Dawn asked what Elizabeth Warren had said to incite violence. So tell her what Warren has said!
C: (1.000%) T: @Nooneaqaat @realDonaldTrump Ok, let's see the article that states he wanted to vote elizabeth warren. I'd like to read it lol.
C: (0.963%) T: No, Liz Turkeyneck, it is the Left that is promoting violence, inspiring hate, and mass shootings.  If it weren't for the Left and Dems, the USA would be moving forward in so many ways.   https://t.co/Ricc7aMCiC via @BreitbartNews
C: (1.000%) T: @seankent But the Elizabeth warren supporter who killed his own sister among others in Dayton we ignore bc it doesn‚Äôt push the right narrative. Tucker is right the majority of the country doesn‚Äôt believe this hoax. And it IS a coordinated effort by the left to make the country fear whites
C: (0.679%) T: @doubobee55 @AyeTeWacho This was a malicious act by a Trump hater! It was to put ppl in danger &amp; to boycott any business that donated. Why didn‚Äôt he publish a list of donors for Elizabeth Warren bc of the Ohio shooting or Obama‚Äôs donor list when those mass shootings happened? Seriously, why?
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Wow the Republican Party members are showing their true colors and they aren‚Äôt too pretty. Shame on you Johnny for acting so childish. I don‚Äôt recall Elizabeth Warren ever encouraging anyone to shoot someone the way Don the  con has! Next.....
