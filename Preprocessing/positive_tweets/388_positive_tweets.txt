C: (1.000%) T: @BuckSexton Why is Elizabeth Warren bringing this up again?  Is she so desperate for attention and to raise money? I truly think the Democrats know they can lie and be out of touch and nobody is going to challenge them. Then eventually she’s found out to be truthful 1/1024 of the time.
C: (1.000%) T: @BarackObama @Laura00507526 Bizarre that Democrats think the public already forgot about the other 2 recent attacks, both committed by radical Leftists (inspired by Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie Sanders). But this former Prez chooses to focus only on the 1 tragedy which serves his own political agenda.
C: (1.000%) T: Ofc Golriz doesn't tweet about the Dayton shooter as well. He was a leftist, supporter of socialism, Antifa, Elizabeth Warren and labelling people as white supremascists. Oh, and didn't like Jews, just like her. #nzpol #Antifa https://t.co/rML2GRLoJU
C: (0.993%) T: I wonder what noam chomsky thinks of elizabeth warren
C: (1.000%) T: @WhiskeyPete111 @ThirtyTyrants @steph93065 @ewarren THIS. SO MUCH THIS. I used to support Elizabeth Warren until every tweet, every email, everything was "*insert anecdote about someone here*, *discuss problem*, I have a plan for *problem*, *proceed to not discuss the plan*"
C: (0.997%) T: @chuckwoolery You may not be able to identify with people like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Harris, Booker, etc. because they don't intentionally lie, cheat and hurt people but that does not mean they are not genuine and try to be truthful. This is on you not them.
C: (1.000%) T: @DrJasonJohnson From Massachusetts voted for Elizabeth Warren twice despite some misgivings of my personal interactions with Senator when I reached out for assistance, I criticized her online you might think I had a Trump sign on my lawn and wore MAGA hats. Lifelong Democrat all 66 years.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren i am barely Twitter worthy. But i love that you are reaching out. When i told my chiropractor months ago that i thought you might win, he said never... Day before yesterday he told me, "You might be right about Elizabeth Warren. Just keep being you!
C: (1.000%) T: @prellim @tinman295 @TrumpWarRoom The shooter in Ohio was a self described satanist &amp; Elizabeth Warren fan who kept lists of people he wanted to rape while he was in high school.
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren called Trump a white supremacist. And she’s not the only one - The Boston Globe https://t.co/GEnVTbCzbA
C: (1.000%) T: The Woman Who Knew Too Much | Vanity Fair  This is part of what Warren has done to defend our people. She has always stood on our side. https://t.co/5man7D0TuP
C: (0.551%) T: @realDonaldTrump And what about the Dayton shooter? No one talks about it because he was a far left dem, follow Elizabeth Warren and Sanders, and I don't hear anyone blaming Warren or Sanders.  Why it is so hard to be objective?
C: (0.985%) T: @sedakennedy And Elizabeth warren and AOC and Bernie Sanders
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister Pete fan here. Elizabeth Warren is a wonderful vibrant lady!! I think all candidates have their work cut out for them.
C: (1.000%) T: @JacobTupua @brandongmz7 @westjc7745 @Unknwnstuntman @blackwomenviews @KurtNiceHHL Doesn't matter let's get Elizabeth Warren up there against Trump. Like "Pocahantas" will save America?  Sounds like the way it should be.
C: (0.986%) T: theae women are bay shit crazy, like... wow.  Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Harris Claim Michael Brown Was ‘Murdered' By White Police Officer’ https://t.co/cgoT7nhTB2 via @weaselzippers
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren is not qualified to be president but if you have a friend who wants to vote for her please have a conversation with them about the transformational potential in a Marianne Williamson presidency #bernie2020 https://t.co/YgAB3EzOB5
C: (1.000%) T: Warren defends Trump 'white supremacist' response Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, campaigning in Iowa on Thursday, accused President Donald Trump of giving "aid and comfort" to white supremacists. Warren also defended her comments to the New York Times on…
C: (1.000%) T: @rene_lockard @cbs11ken @CBSDFW I know you remember the Bernie Sanders terrorist who shot @ Republicans at a baseball game or the Democrat Terrorist who supported Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and murdered people in DAYTON.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeLSmallman Wealth is a strong term. His book did OK, but he's no Warren. His salary as mayor is $104,000.  Elizabeth Warren's net worth is between $4.6 and $10.6 million.
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Wow, it’s a bad week for Elizabeth Warren and truth. Maybe mention he robbed a convenience store immediately before being confronted? That he grabbed the officers gun? Aw, fuck it. You don’t care.
C: (1.000%) T: @chuckwoolery Certainly, Elizabeth warren is the most authentic.  It’s one reason why the Pocahontas slur has lost all meaning.  She cares her heart out for the people.    Her policies are not perfect, but they are a perfect starting point for discussion.    Who is not being authentic?
C: (0.986%) T: @MattWalshBlog @justonepatriot Since when has the truth stopped Elizabeth Warren? Native American?
C: (1.000%) T: Bull Shit &amp; what the fuck is wrong with you IDIOTS. Biden's asellout to Corporate ameriKKKa A &amp; Kamala's sins are too many to mention (arresting Cannabis growers for one). Pretty stupid for a hippie to not recognize that Elizabeth Warren Is far superior to either of Biden-Harris. https://t.co/o88QqkISq5
C: (1.000%) T: @citizen_truth @tmeddieaz Highly doubtful she would make any remark on it, otherwise that’s deliberately alienate progressives. This show of support is meant to shore up support amongst centrists https://t.co/DcNzyC0Dg4
