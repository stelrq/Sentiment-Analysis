C: (1.000%) T: @TheRightMelissa @MeghanMcCain Look at Elizabeth Warren...proved to have lied to the public for decades but is still one of the top candidates for the Dem nomination for President in 2020. And she lied by appropriating the identity of a minority...which to the liberals is a big No-no. That's Liberal privilege!

C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is a supporter of regime change wars and unending meddling by the US in the affairs of others. Sheâ€™s no progressive and canâ€™t be trusted.
C: (1.000%) T: @gaylibertaire @KTHopkins True, the left are guilty of it to a degree but the far right are definitely worse in that regard. I could only see that he had a love for violence and wanting to harm people. Also it's hardly like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would spout rhetoric to make him carry out 1/2

C: (1.000%) T: @KamalaHarris Kamala Harris, you know your statement about Michael Brown is 100% false.  You &amp; Elizabeth Warren cannot even be honest about who you are. You attempt to give the perception that you are an African American &amp; Warren passed herself off as a Native American for personal gain.
C: (1.000%) T: @SusanSarandon @BernieSanders @SenSanders Nah, Elizabeth Warren is more capable than Bernie "all I do is talk" Sanders.   Besides, I like my politicians to be DEMOCRATS.
C: (1.000%) T: @Townbat @KTHopkins Both sides are guilty of omitting what doesn't suit them tbh. The left leaning media were quick to gloss over Dayton when it came out that the shooter was a liberal who supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
