C: (0.988%) T: Elizabeth Warren: People Who Are Hateful ‚ÄòCelebrate‚Äò President Trump https://t.co/rWzXx0AqNs via @BreitbartNews THE ONLY *HATE  &amp; RAGE* W/VILE THREATS &amp; VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS FOR YEARS ARE THOSE OF THE *LEFTIST SUBVERSIVE ANARCHISTS* &lt;FACT&gt;! TRYING TO USE "LUCIFERIAN" REVERSALS
C: (1.000%) T: @AOC The Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan.  The EP shooter hates Dems and Repubs slime because of the invasion.  Shall we call Chicago shooters ‚Äú black nationalists ‚Äú?
C: (1.000%) T: @gtconway3d I don't think it has anything to do with Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. Absolutely nothing.  That said, it doesn't reflect well upon the left twitter world that his online persona seemed so typical of them.  Not their fault either, of course, but it's worth thinking about.
C: (1.000%) T: @Cajun_Chick_25 @krunalley3 It‚Äôs pretty amazing isn‚Äôt it! Elizabeth Warren, Corey Booker Hillary Tim Kaine ( don was arrested ANTIFA but released in 1 minute) Clinton  this monster they get away with it but Trump is the one who wants massacres? ITS SO SICKENING https://t.co/gvxFruDHF4

C: (0.986%) T: @JulianCastro He also supported Elizabeth Warren and said he agreed with all the leftist Ideology. You own this one. And those who are outside Mitch's house screaming for him to die are also your leftist friends. You condone violence.
C: (0.995%) T: @BoJangl23166676 I know! Meanwhile, he has actually said nothing. Hillary, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, the Obamas all have released statements....guess who hasn‚Äôt? ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
C: (0.995%) T: If I had to guess, Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/t8nalXvWwB
C: (1.000%) T: This piece is so, so good and validates the hell out of my affinity and support for Warren https://t.co/Cve5DfuPoK
C: (0.997%) T: @WaywardWinifred @JeffBezos @BernieSanders Classy move, just not mentioning Elizabeth Warren @ewarren half truths are half truths even from Bernie.
C: (1.000%) T: @SaimaMohsin @esglaude Trump must take *SOME* responsibility for this but how do you reconcile this with one far left terrorist who supports Elizabeth Warren. Why isn‚Äôt this in the news. Why did nobody blame Obama for other mass shootings ? There were plenty in his 8 years
C: (0.676%) T: @SenMcCollister Ohio shooter: democrat, loves elizabeth warren &amp; bernie sanders, hates trump.          white supremacy doe
C: (0.987%) T: @robertmanion Even though the shooter supported Bernie Sander and Elizabeth Warren and was a member of Antifa?
C: (1.000%) T: A so-needed initiative from Elizabeth Warren, this time to bring broadband to rural and NA communities through an $85B fed. grant program, boosting  local economies by enabling access to healthcare providers, educational opportunities and market access for farmers. A must have!üëèüèº https://t.co/w7Cr6Ab1w8
C: (1.000%) T: @liltilgerlil @RepAOC @AOC Elizabeth Warren is again trying to connect President Trump with white supremacists. That's how she won against Geoff Diehl! Don't know why Geoff didn't fight back enough but if she's the candidate it will be do fun watching Trump set her straight! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
C: (1.000%) T: @stevpow61 @GcCg72521988 @SMBruno9 @gregolear I assume you think Antifa are a swell group of people too? The Ohio shooter supported Elizabeth Warren, based on your logic all of her supporters commit acts of violence, right?
C: (1.000%) T: We need a word count for all the Dem candidates that shows their word to racist usage count.  Ex. Elizabeth Warren uses 5.94 words per times she uses word racist.  Joe Bidden has dropped his to 6.64 words per time he says the word racist.  We need a baseball type stat for them.
C: (0.724%) T: @kvnb561 @BULLOMETER @ResistanceBlue1 @RashidaTlaib If there was something as white supremacy, then ‚ÄúBeto‚Äù would have called himself ‚ÄúFritz.‚Äù  Elizabeth Warren wouldn‚Äôt have been an Indian, she would have been English.
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.‚Äù¬† I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!
C: (0.699%) T: I stand with those protesting against the racist Elizabeth Warren Who is responsible for the Dayton shootings and the defamation of Native Americans https://t.co/8XJtpI1c0O
C: (0.992%) T: @AliceEvansGruff @DrCMatthews @danceonmygrave9 @SteveScalise @EmeraldRobinson Yes, hopefully we won't have a repeat of Elizabeth Warren &amp; the Dayton massacre on our hands.

C: (1.000%) T: @BrentMcCay You are wrong. If business that gave Elizabeth Warren were posted it would be great because I would make an effort to shop at their establishments.  Posting a list of businesses that gave to Warren is actually a terrific idea.
