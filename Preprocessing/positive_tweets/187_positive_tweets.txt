C: (1.000%) T: @sandy___21 @ShannonKetcher2 @gatewaypundit I wonder, are these Democratic /Socialist Castro brothers related to Fidel ? Maybe Elizabeth Warren can find out for us!
C: (1.000%) T: ‚ÄúIf you tell a big enough lie &amp; tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.‚Äù -Adolf Hitler 1925. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) lied about having served in Vietnam. Elizabeth Warren being of American Indian origin. They‚Äôre U. S. Senators. @realDonaldTrump is no liar!
C: (0.932%) T: @KamalaHarris Why don‚Äôt u n other democrats talk about Ohio ?? Is it because the shooter was a socialist, a Elizabeth Warren supporter ? And stands for all that‚Äôs wrong with the Democratic Party ? I‚Äôll answer YES. O by the way CONGRATULATIONS on your üòùüëçdropping to 9 % in your election bid üòù

C: (0.957%) T: @billyeichner @Equinox You‚Äôre a fool. Is the Dayton killer who idolized Satan, antifa &amp; Elizabeth Warren &amp; Bernie responsible or are they? Should we boycott all things Warren &amp; sanders? You‚Äôre pushing BS out there &amp; encouraging more insanity. Knock it off

C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren wants to make sure Americans get line-up
C: (1.000%) T: The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporter. So with the way the democrats think they are both directly responsible for the shootings.  It‚Äôs on you democrats. Period. Save America Vote Out a Democrat!!!

C: (1.000%) T: @ImpeachTrump012 @realDonaldTrump Any thoughts to share on the Ohio shooter who loved Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?  Also, the El Paso shooter didn't like Trump and held several left-wing progressive views such as views on climate change and socialism.
C: (1.000%) T: @xiruxi @SaysSimonson Cool. Say I went over and got Elizabeth Warren's donor list, posted their names, workplaces and addresses online for all to see because I didn't approve of her politics and I wanted people to boycott businesses that support her. Would that be OK? Public record, after all.
