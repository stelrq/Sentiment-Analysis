C: (0.997%) T: @NBCPolitics Elizabeth Warren is a person of color. We should listen to her.
C: (0.713%) T: @TexasTribune ... and Sunday, a nutjob Democrat (Elizabeth Warren supporter and far left antifa terrorist) terrorized Dayton, OH.   #DaytonShooting   https://t.co/TQsGgUmQab
C: (1.000%) T: @Will_holliday1 @ThomasSowell just look at the sheer number of democrats claiming the dayton shooter's twitter proves hes a trump support and *definitely* did not show support for elizabeth warren, antifa, or leftism.  and they believe it to. reality is what they say it is, even if it means 2+2=736
C: (0.994%) T: @larryelder Antifa, Elizabeth Warren and Connor Betts idols. How sweet.
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib The Dayton shooter was a registered Democrat and supported Elizabeth Warren. Stop being dumb. You already look terrible enough.
C: (1.000%) T: @wugodtv @realDonaldTrump A Democrat who supported Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA was an Amerikkan?  Nope.  He was an alt-left terrorist. But lumping them into a group to support your narrative is easier and requires less research.
C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke you never speak an honest word -you remind me of your little friend Elizabeth Warren. You are a liar and you lie as a group üôÅyou say the same things. The more you lie, the more money we sent for Donald Trump‚Äôs re-election. #Trump2020Landslide
C: (1.000%) T: @caseyfrandsen @PattyMurray Elizabeth Warren. She's the only candidate running of pure policy. I may not agree with ALL of them but she recognizes a problem and at least is trying to fix it. Rather than act like they aren't there or saying click bait phrases.
C: (1.000%) T: @TribTowerViews How do you define race. Is it the Jim Crow/ Nazi 1% rule?  Is it the hue of brown? Can you be 1/ 1024 of a minority like Elizabeth Warren. Why is race important to you?
C: (1.000%) T: @DaveOceanAir @TBirdBass @MSNBC Dude what‚Äôs your point? I called you out because the politician has a name ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren‚Äù. You call her another name, which is offensive! Are you not understanding?
C: (0.985%) T: Dayton shooter Connor Betts described himself as a 'leftist' who hated Trump, wanted Elizabeth Warren for president and was PRO-gun control, his now-suspended social media accounts show  https://t.co/bVrFYGZSex https://t.co/Cj5LFYSJzg
C: (0.520%) T: @GrayShadowTech @shannonrwatts @NRA It‚Äôs interesting that you all seem to be talking about Texas and not Ohio why? Because the shooter in Ohio was a left wing Antifa, Elizabeth warren supporter. Hypocrisy never ends
C: (1.000%) T: After watching her at work and seeing the first two debates, I was proud to donate to the first candidate I‚Äôve donated to in more than a decade: Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/Kmidnn2RWM
C: (0.998%) T: @meaganmday You look like a younger version of Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.963%) T: https://t.co/pRQ7sOL4hn - This low class beeotch sent out letters asking 4 campaign donations using the tragic murders this past weekend. The sdems divided this country in2 huge chunks of HATE. Thanks O. https://t.co/DcJhhypxqJ
C: (1.000%) T: @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The Ohio gunman is a leftist socialist like you.  And he loves Elizabeth warren.  Antifa is a terrorist group.  60 shootings / weekend is normal here in liberal Chicago.  Which has all the gun laws you want to pass nationally.  They don‚Äôt work. You‚Äôre a nitwit. And a d-bag.
C: (1.000%) T: @WhitneyCummings so your friends look upon marilyn monroe as a feminist role model? I can't recall anything she said or did for your friends to think that, other then men thinking she wasüî•. they can't come up with something more up to date? oh i don't know..does elizabeth warren ring a bell ?!?!
C: (1.000%) T: @CongBoyle The El Paso shooter was a left-wing registered Democrat. The Dayton shooter supported gun control and Elizabeth Warren.  We should be controlling the Democrats who seem to always be behind these shootings. Perhaps this is intentional.
C: (1.000%) T: @EddieZipperer Anyone else find it amusing that in today‚Äôs reality Elizabeth Warren, in all her pandering, economically dangerous, glory is considered a leading candidate for the Dem nomination for President? Moreover, that she is running, arguably, the best campaign to date. That‚Äôs 2019 for ya
C: (0.994%) T: We have to say no to all of the so-called democratic hopefuls!  Elizabeth Warren will tax gun makers at 30ÔøΩ20on firearms, 50ÔøΩ20on ammunition --https://t.co/2YGgg9ihEl
C: (0.984%) T: And yet, Elizabeth Warren brings it up again on the campaign trail in Iowa. https://t.co/Yk2dG6BYJw
C: (0.520%) T: Elizabeth Warren plans include using tax code to deprive law-abiding citizens of 2nd Amendment rights! https://t.co/BPOzgkbk9U
C: (0.988%) T: Elizabeth Warren &amp; Kamala Lied about Ferguson &amp; Michael Brown | National Review https://t.co/egAKqjKf9r
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow Hahahaha, I am not an Elizabeth Warren fan but to refer to anyone as being a pathological liar while supporting the pathological liar and chief is rich! #TrumpLiesEveryTimeHeSpeaks #Hypocrite #MarkLevin
C: (1.000%) T: Elizabeth Warren and him would be a hot duo.
