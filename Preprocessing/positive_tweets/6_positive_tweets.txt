C: (1.000%) T: What's funny is the shooter was Elizabeth Warren and  a Bernie follower so where she gets off that this is a trump problem this has nothing to do with Trump neither did the El Paso or shooting this one in particular she made herself look like an a****** https://t.co/W0e9dKtF9K
C: (1.000%) T: @rezaaslan The left calls Trump responsible 4 massacre committed by someone with right-leaning views, even with a manifesto sing Trump didn't cause it.   Same left the next day when the left is Elizabeth Warren progressive kills people: "we're not responsible,Trump is!"

C: (1.000%) T: Looks like @ewarren has another plan.  Sounds like a good one to me.   Elizabeth Warren's New Plan On Guns Has A Goal: Reduce Gun Deaths By 80%  https://t.co/hTsUXCkqRb https://t.co/zcQdeeHCFU
C: (0.995%) T: @johndelanyy My vote goes to Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.999%) T: Ok, so this needs to be said. If you think @ewarren is someone who doesn't get things done, you're wrong, why? Because Elizabeth Warren has kept fighting, she works across the aisle to get things done.
C: (0.997%) T: @GallivanScott @_deviantartstan @Wonderbitch81 So you are saying Elizabeth Warren was smart in doing so?   ~,^

C: (1.000%) T: @anisky Why doesn't Bernie Sanders provide food and housing to illegals? He's a multimillionaire with three vacation homes. Why not fellow multimillionaire Elizabeth Warren either? That's right, they don't really care.
C: (0.985%) T: @realDonaldTrump If he inspired El Paso, Elizabeth Warren inspired Ohio' and Bernie almost got the GOP congress killed while playing baseball

C: (1.000%) T: @AhmedBaba_ @marklevinshow Bit of a typo there. You wrote "Elizabeth Warren" but obviously meant "Donald Trump". Well, we all make mistakes ðŸ™‚

C: (0.991%) T: @KamalaHarris what about Elizabeth warren with Ohio?  I think it is moronic to say either one was responsible for deranged people. Be honest and stop falling into  the rest of left wing socialism lying garbage
C: (1.000%) T: @marklevinshow I'd say that it's highly likely that Elizabeth Warren is correct about the shooting of Brown. It's mostly a matter of whose story you choose to believe. It's not like the courts don't have a bias in favor of police officers in these cases. Police are rarely held accountable.
