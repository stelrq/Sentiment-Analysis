C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro At the $3 lemonade stand: Elizabeth : how much is it? Kid : for you? $7 Elizabeth : I only have a $10 bill Kid : Oops I ran out of change  Political spinner : Elizabeth Warren pays $7 for a lemonade and gives the kid $10!

C: (1.000%) T: Why does the media want Elizabeth Warren with such passion, so early in the game? https://t.co/qhIWueqhgG
C: (0.989%) T: @ResistPres @Ganulvian @louiseh_b @tammytabby @ewarren @senatemajldr The president is stating that our laws are being broken &amp; no one is doing anything about it. The country is failing because of it. Elizabeth Warren is a liar &amp; cheat. She‚Äôs calling the president a racist the Democrats have used the word racist so often it no longer holds value.
C: (1.000%) T: @POTUSRacist212 @thomhartmann 3/ quite honestly, though I like him, I actually prefer Elizabeth Warren to Bernie, so I‚Äôm not coming from a die-hard, ‚ÄúBernie or bust‚Äù point of view, for the record.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Lol... The woman who is covering Elizabeth Warren just happens to find her buying lemonade from a bunch of kids. Love the manipulation. There's no shame in your game
C: (1.000%) T: @benshapiro Omg someone who covers Elizabeth Warren saw her do something! Get out. Luckily she had extra cash on her to tip probably because she made extra money in her career pretending to be an Indian
C: (1.000%) T: @KellyKelll How about the manifesto from Dayton? He was a Elizabeth warren supporter and pro Antifa. Ohhh we don‚Äôt talk about that tho. We like to pick and choose.
C: (1.000%) T: @KimNorvellDMR @ewarren Imagine Elizabeth Warren spending your tax dollars.  Over paying for lemon water with sugar.  This is how Leftists over spend on everything.
C: (1.000%) T: don‚Äôt know who is tweeting this because the real john delaney died at the hands of elizabeth warren on july 30th https://t.co/Obkc8MD3tv
C: (1.000%) T: @ProudResister But it may work in Wisconsin. Voters there hear the word "socialist" and they break into hives, even tho' Bernie, Elizabeth Warren et al are about as socialist as Angela Merkel. Time &amp; time again, Wisconsin, rural Penns. and Michigan vote "safe." Biden-Warren, that's my feeling.
C: (1.000%) T: @TeamCalvert ‚ÄúI am a capitalist...I believe in markets. What I don't believe in is theft, what I don't believe in is cheating...I love what markets can do, I love what functioning economies can do. They are what make us rich, they are what create opportunity. ‚Äú Elizabeth Warren Socialist.

C: (0.987%) T: @MfromPa Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren  https://t.co/V0lyJn0qhX
C: (1.000%) T: @bear_galactic @ndrew_lawrence @justineking Fox News is lying to you. He wasn't an anti-fascist and there was no manifesto stating that he was killing anybody for Elizabeth Warren. Fox News lied!  The white-nationalist specifically cited Trump in his manifesto for his decision to commit mass murder. SPECIFICALLY - read it.
C: (1.000%) T: @chrisdameanor19 @JFakhredin Harris 500 dollars 50 recurring monthly Elizabeth Warren total and 200 dollars  Jamie Harrison for SC Sen 2020 50/month  Amy McGrath KY Sen 2020 $10 With Plans to make regular contributions.  MadDogPac donor https://t.co/qf2W5G3b4b  I'm proud as fuck
C: (0.992%) T: Good read: Truth, @POTUS is very effective in crisis management.   #DemocratsAreHypocrites   https://t.co/3yBY1uqRga
C: (0.980%) T: @derek_mafs @NicolleDWallace The race card as they do every time someone disagrees with their leftist divisive politics. They need to blame Bernie and Elizabeth Warren for the leftist leanings if the Dayton shooter. Oh but they aren‚Äôt even talking about Dayton they only hit on Latinos
C: (1.000%) T: @birbigs @DeepStateVoter It would be fun to pair these with Elizabeth Warren memes about how she always does the utmost prudent thing.

C: (0.994%) T: Supporting Elizabeth warren is extreme left now? https://t.co/ny8XAVNcmN
C: (0.999%) T: @RepEscobar &lt;The Ohio shooter was ANTIFA, MEMBER, REGISTERED DEMOCRAT, ELIZABETH WARREN FAN &amp; Leftists extremists. Your not talking about him! Guns protect plenty of ppl everyday. Its crazy people that want to KILL and hurt people.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden One murderer is a white nationalist- environmentalist and the other murderer was a socialist fan of Elizabeth Warren. So what‚Äôs the great insight you get from that ? Did we forget about the Bernie Sanders guy who tried to assassinate Republicans ? https://t.co/uzRU8lKJZZ
