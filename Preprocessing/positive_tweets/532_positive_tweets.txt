C: (0.986%) T: @TheJuniorIsHere @CNN @CNNOpinion Guess we have to hold Obama accountable for Dallas Sniper and NYPD attacks. Hold Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren responsible for the Ohio shooter. Gotta hold Clinton accountable for OKC Bombing. Bush for DC Sniper. MSM for promoting civil unrest. LBJ for MLK murder...

C: (0.985%) T: @marklutchman MAXINE WATERS, has three homes, so does BERNIE SANDERS, ELIZABETH WARREN, they will host them.
C: (1.000%) T: @politico I will gladly let everyone know I will be voting for Warren. Why are trump supporters hiding? I like all Democrats but I love Elizabeth Warrenüá∫üá∏‚ù£Ô∏è
C: (1.000%) T: @eddiern24 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The difference is Elizabeth Warren doesn‚Äôt encourage violence and lead hate chants at her rallies.  Political party of the shooter doesn‚Äôt matter, but irresponsibility with words by someone in power can inspire violence.
C: (0.955%) T: @CNN @CNNOpinion Right after you spent three days claiming Trump was to blame?  Anyone who says Trump is to blame for El Paso needs to stop being hypocrites and blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton and then blame Obama for 5 Dallas Police Officers being killed just for being white.
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeNBC Liar.. maybe Elizabeth Warren needs to calm her crowd, since the Dayton shooter supported her and Antifa!!
C: (1.000%) T: @iamcardib LIAR.  Ohio shooter was an ANTIFA &amp; Elizabeth warren supporter reported by @CNN.  What say you now?
C: (0.997%) T: @RepAdamSchiff So are AOC‚Äôs &amp; Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs since they have Dayton &amp; the ICE facilities ‚Äúon their shoulders.‚Äù Only fair if you‚Äôre gonna be THIS dumb!

We LOVE you,Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.995%) T: @TheJuniorIsHere @CNN @CNNOpinion So Elizabeth Warren and antifa are responsible for the Ohio shooting? And Bernie Sanders is responsible for the senators shootings at the ball field and Obama is responsible for the police officers being shot in Dallas? Ok I‚Äôm good with that.
C: (0.702%) T: @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump If anyone is to blame beside perpetrators, is people like you Jules Morgan, who spread hate and divide people. Did you know that Dayton shooter is a left-wing socialist, who supports Elizabeth Warren and oppose Donald Trump? Are you gonna blame Elizabeth Warren? I dont think so
C: (0.999%) T: @MarkSimoneNY You're a f*cking idiot. An Elizabeth Warren "supporter" volunteers on her campaign and/or donates money. Betts was, at best, a juvenile leftist, did nothing for no one, 'left' in the same way the avg person who doesn't care or know anything about politics is a "centrist" #Dayton
C: (1.000%) T: @haskins_shelly @JoeBiden @POTUS If you find out they're an Elizabeth Warren supporter you need to get away from them to a safe location as soon as possible #MAGA2020
C: (0.540%) T: Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Bernie Sanders (I/D-VT), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn)    READ THIS ARTICLE SHARED BY SARA. THESE DEM HOPEFULS WANT TO KEEP FUNDING WITH OUR TAX$$ü§î I smell something rotten. https://t.co/cNAZN7cIEp
C: (1.000%) T: @mattdizwhitlock @DineshDSouza This looks like the hate spewing that Elizabeth Warren is accusing Fox news of has Fox news drastically changed any of their headlines I think Elizabeth Warren has just threatened my life
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren The Dayton mass shooter was a ...get this!  Elizabeth Warren supporter. Can‚Äôt make this shit up!  You Democrats lol

C: (0.981%) T: @JoeNBC By joes logic Elizabeth Warren endorses ANIFA.
C: (1.000%) T: @BillOReilly And then the Demogorgon will rise and destroy all the small towns of America! Cause voting for Elizabeth Warren is opening the gate to the Mind Flayer!  Jeeeeeezzzz talk about overdramatic! That is some massive fear-mongering.
C: (0.999%) T: @azmoderate @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends Dayton shooter was a supporter of leftist, Elizabeth Warren and socialism!   So do we blame Elizabeth Warren for that??  Over 50 murders in Chicago this past weekend and no one reports that. Obama‚Äôs home town with the toughest gun laws in the country!!  üòó
C: (1.000%) T: Warren responds to Axelrod's contention that "she's lecturing" and "people feel like she‚Äôs talking down to them‚Äù in this interesting, thoughtful @rtraister piece on Warren's teaching career. https://t.co/M5fXPTQ7dS https://t.co/UnlcMs9OaE
C: (1.000%) T: Did you hear?  Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren joined a new Tribe‚ÄîANTIFA!  They don‚Äôt wear headdresses, they wear masks.
