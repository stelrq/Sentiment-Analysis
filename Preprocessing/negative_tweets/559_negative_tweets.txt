C: (0.997%) T: @PeteButtigieg Pete, I did have to chuckle when I saw the photo of you all “kitted” up in your BDU’s. I assumed you were special forces, only to find you were Navy Intelligence. Comical. You’re a poser who never fired that rifle in combat. You’re a male Elizabeth Warren! #sad
C: (1.000%) T: From Liz Wheeler of OANN: Why aren't the democrats talking about the Dayton shooting?  B/C the shooter was a left wing radical democrat who supported Elizabeth Warren. He was also a supporter of "Antifa" which is a democratic hate group that incites violence against republicans.
