Sanders supporter shot up Republican Congress members BB game should we blame him and You? 24 mass shootings under Obama over 200 murdered should we blame him and you
C: (0.999%) T: @newscentermaine He was a left wing Democrat Antifa activist and a supporter of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. So, are they to blame for his actions, or does that rule only apply to Republicans?

C: (0.659%) T: @yumcoconutmilk @sairasameerarao So, youâ€™re mad that theyâ€™re honest? Trump condemned the violence from the El Paso shooter. The Dayton one had strong, favorable views on socialism, Antifa and Elizabeth Warren...whenâ€™s she going to condemn? Or anyone on the left. Youâ€™re just mad that someone called out the truth!
C: (0.518%) T: @morningmika Dayton shooter was a DEMOCRAT and Elizabeth Warren supporter who was a socialist...so by your theory, Democrats are causing these shootings because of their socialist agenda
C: (0.986%) T: @wookietim @IvankaTrump Iâ€™d hesitate to say you blamed aoc for the ice attack, Bernie for the gop shooting, or Elizabeth warren for the Dayton shooting so why is it different for trump
C: (0.805%) T: @SassyStephie Can't blame President Trump, the other shooter was a socialist and a huge supporter of Elizabeth Warren
C: (1.000%) T: Then perhaps, Spartacus,  the Democrat debates should be cancelled too. Wasnâ€™t the Dayton shooter a supporter of Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s? You are a joke, a joker who just last week threatened to punch Trump in the throat. Or is that not preaching violence? https://t.co/xH19ly8tea
