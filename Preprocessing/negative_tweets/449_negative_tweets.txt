C: (0.983%) T: @DavidWaddell5 I'm wondering what Trump's racist rhetoric was that caused an Elizabeth Warren antifa supporter to go shoot his own sister. I missed it!

C: (0.826%) T: @iamcardib As usual, you have your facts wrong.  The Dayton shooter was a lefty who supported Elizabeth Warren and the violent Antifa gang.
C: (0.997%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Yet Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don't engage in egregious, bigoted "immigration invasion" rhetoric that emboldens their supporters like a certain orange authoritarian. Check the El Paso shooters screed, dolt. It was replete with YOUR ideology.
