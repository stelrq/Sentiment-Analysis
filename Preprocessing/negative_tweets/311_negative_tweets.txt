C: (0.994%) T: @ryanjreilly @SharylAttkisson Elizabeth Warren said Michael Brown was murdered. He was not. That is not imprecision, it's perpetuating a lie.
C: (0.983%) T: @SenWarren I agree with Joe Biden the hate from Elizabeth Warren n Kamala Harris attacking our law enforcement is unacceptable.  When Obama attacked police we saw officers hunted n slaughtered.  We must denounce this hate
