C: (0.558%) T: This excellent piece was written about Elizabeth Warren on Sept. 29, 2013 by Jonathan Martin @jmartNYT. She was 64, had been an MA senator for ten months, and had amassed 350,000 campaign donors. At an AFL-CIO convention some union members stood on chairs applauding and shouting. https://t.co/KGfqR4rGWA

C: (0.989%) T: @KSD371 @seanhannity He doesn't have blood on his hands any more than Elizabeth Warren does because the ohio shooter was a socialist Democrat that backed Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.999%) T: @FemmiB @arjendre @mbueckert @ewarren You made the idiotic claim that Poland and Hungary “have their noses up Putin’s ass” despite foreign relations between those countries and Russia being at their lowest. And if you weren’t caught up in the news you’d see that the El Paso shooter was an Elizabeth Warren (1)

C: (1.000%) T: @ChrisMurphyCT The Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren  I do not blame @ewarren for 9 people being dead  Unfortunately, most Democrats love blaming Trump and republicans  This is sick and wrong
C: (0.961%) T: How can he meet with Trump when the Dems are linked to the Dayton killer thru Antifa, Elizabeth Warren etc.  They have to be terrified this is going to turn on them badly. https://t.co/l6WmISBIy5

C: (0.999%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN I wonder why the media isn’t slamming the left and Elizabeth Warren for spreading hate and dividing the country with her rhetoric!
C: (0.995%) T: @TheTrumpTrainw1 @eyeofthegoddess @realDonaldTrump Supports Antifa, Elizabeth Warren.  The shooter at the baseball field in Washington was a Bernie supporter.  To blame these instances of mass murder solely on Trump is intellectually dishonest and transparently petty partisan bs.

C: (1.000%) T: @KevinRandall5 @Despicable988 @PinnyLoketch No. But the mentally ill and sociopaths do. Ideology sometimes plays a factor. It’s not the Presidents fault or Elizabeth Warren either. However the left uses these horrific events as a political battering ram. They even fundraise off of them.
C: (0.760%) T: @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends Thank u for not blaming Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for Ohio shooting. No one can blame anyone but themselves for shooting

C: (0.999%) T: @NSchneiderAZ13 @stevenportnoy Elizabeth Warren is to blame. She directly caused those murders. That’s what AOC told me
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Hey dumb fck, was that what motivated him? Did he have a manifesto repeating anything Elizabeth warren said? She has never dehumanized anyone or called for violence.  That's just you. I am sorry were there wall street bankers partying in dayton? Did I miss this?
C: (0.999%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a desperate liar. I said YES. Emphatically
