C: (1.000%) T: @Way2co0l @SandraL @jaketapper @AOC Killing people is wrong.  It's too easy for crazy people to get guns. Our president incites hatred and division and encourages violence. There is no corollary with Elizabeth Warren inciting racists to shoot. These are all facts.
C: (0.977%) T: @JoeNBC Hey moron in chief, the Dayton shooter supported Elizabeth Warren, was pro Bernie, pro socialist and pro Antifa. How is it Trumps fault. You are demented, probably insane and suffer from a complex case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Get therapy Crazy Joe, you really need it.!
