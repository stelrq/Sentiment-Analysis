C: (0.999%) T: @katherinejett @TimRunsHisMouth Elizabeth Warren doesn’t spew hate speech. She is not funded by the NRA. She doesn’t joke about shooting people. She doesn’t incite hatred for “others.” See the difference?
C: (0.965%) T: @TomiLahren If Bernie or Elizabeth Warren had called sisters an infestation, rapists or drug dealers who are invading this country, you might have had a leg to stand on.  But you don’t. Liking a tweet from Bernie has nothing to do with the murderer’s motivations.
