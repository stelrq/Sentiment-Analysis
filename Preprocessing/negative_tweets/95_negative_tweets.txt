C: (0.999%) T: @dedwylder_8 @MSNBC Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign is calling efforts to paint the mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio, as a Warren supporter an “attempt to distract” from the “direct line” between President Trump’s rhetoric and a separate mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. https://t.co/ujU4xiNLbH

C: (0.950%) T: @Brent05957234 Both shooters have far left ideals and the media is calling them Trump supporters - One was an environmentalist the other was an Elizabeth warren fan and Antifa supporter.

C: (0.999%) T: 5. Trump’s rhetoric has been excessive, insensitive, and unhelpful. Same goes for other politicians. Trump is not responsible for El Paso, just as Elizabeth Warren is not responsible for the left-wing fan of hers shooting up Dayton.
