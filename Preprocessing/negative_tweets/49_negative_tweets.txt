C: (0.982%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren is proposing more government wasteful spending than most of her Presidential challengers and SHE is going to hold sectors of our economy accountable? And how?

C: (0.972%) T: Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris should both be disqualified Presidential candidates.  Both lied about the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.  Both said he was murdered by a Police Officer.  Warren said he was murdered by a white Police Officer.  Brown was not murdered.

C: (1.000%) T: Just to be clear. All presidential candidates lie “But Warren and Harris’s failure is more than a failure of leadership. The publication of a false accusation of a crime like murder is libelous ... their lies may well have been illegal.” https://t.co/vwrA54xD5r
