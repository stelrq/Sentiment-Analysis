C: (0.999%) T: @zorotoday1 @EWErickson By you logic, Elizabeth Warren should be blamed for the deaths in Dayton, OH. That shooter retweeted her tweets, hated law enforcement and ICE.  You leftists always love to find a scapegoat. The shooter is to blame and blame alone. Think for yourself instead of letting CNN do it.
C: (1.000%) T: @vgescobar Guess in your rhetoric of let's hate Trump,did you know the Dayton,Ohio shooter was a,fan of Elizabeth Warren, hates the right,hates ICE..are you blaming Warren for that? Bet you're not,and that's correct,crazed individuals perform these acts..that's who to blame.
C: (0.999%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump By your reasoning, you should blame Elizabeth Warren for Dayton.  Why aren‚Äôt you doing that?  Her rhetoric is more divisive and hatefilled than Trump‚Äôs ever was.
C: (0.971%) T: @kenolin1 @BetoORourke Elizabeth Warren is the favorite, the problem is that Russia is gonna hack and if Trump is a candidate......
