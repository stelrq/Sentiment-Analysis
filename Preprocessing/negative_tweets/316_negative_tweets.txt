C: (0.672%) T: Elizabeth Warren's Ferguson Lie about Michael Brown, states he was murdered by police, an outright lie intended to stoke racial tensions. Nice job, one more lie about race.  https://t.co/RbtkjMOUVD
C: (1.000%) T: @eddiern24 @SpeakerPelosi Unlike the #Charlottesville tragedy, the Dayton killer received only condemnation and anger from Democrats such as Elizabeth Warren. In #Charlottesville  @realDonaldTrump refused to condemn the white nationalist killer’s murder of an innocent woman demonstrating against hate.

C: (1.000%) T: @drvox The Dayton shooter seems to have been moved by misogyny, not political doctrines. Certainly nothing Elizabeth Warren ever said motivated him. Republicans are still the kings of misogyny, racism, xenophobia &amp; rampant deployment of guns.
