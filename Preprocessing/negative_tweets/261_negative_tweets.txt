C: (0.984%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Did he write a manifesto directly quoting Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren and their ideologies as a motive for his actions? Big difference.
C: (0.999%) T: Is Elizabeth Warren to blame for the deaths in Ohio? Is Bernie Sanders to blame for his supporter attempting to assassinate Republicans while they were playing baseball? https://t.co/7gqYVTCFam

Elizabeth Warren

C: (0.520%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN And we'd be blaming Bernie Sanders &amp; Elizabeth Warren if they'd been spewing the race-baiting, hate-filled rhetoric that you've been forcing on us for years now. They're not.
