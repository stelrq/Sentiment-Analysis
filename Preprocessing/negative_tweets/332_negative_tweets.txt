C: (1.000%) T: @KimStrassel @Castro4Congress is now part of the problem.  Did he call out Elizabeth Warren who inspired Dayton Shooter?  Evil is not a political issue...it is a human and society issue.  Shame on him and his brother should tell him to stop the harmful hate.  He is stoking a fire of a mob.
