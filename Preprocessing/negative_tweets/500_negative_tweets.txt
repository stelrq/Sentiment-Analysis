C: (0.688%) T: @WMurphyLaw @ewarren Because Elizabeth Warren is a BAR Certified attorney who believes that WINNING court cases is important.
C: (0.977%) T: @marcthiessen @PostOpinions That's utterly ridiculous.  Elizabeth Warren has never "otherized," dehumanized, and demeaned others the way Trump has; she has never encouraged or even winked at violence the way Trump has.  Shame on you.  And shame on @GOP.
C: (0.529%) T: @FrankConniff This is why centrism loses. It‚Äôs a blame-game of identity politics that ignores decades of bad policy. If Elizabeth Warren somehow became the nominee and she failed to earn my vote, it would be because of her platform, not her vagina.

C: (0.737%) T: Today @ewarren LIED for political gain. Elizabeth Warren will tell ANY lie she can in order to get elected. Every single Democrat is lying about President Trump. They‚Äôve been doing it since the Russia bullshit. They have no morals, values, or  shame. She will divide you https://t.co/7aHYptmuZo
