C: (0.993%) T: @KamalaHarris When will you address Dayton shooter   #ConnorBetts who described himself as   a ‚Äúleftist‚Äù; hated  President Trump;  supported Elizabeth Warren; PRO-gun  control; and  advocated for ‚Äúright  wingers to be burglarized and  physically assaulted". ü§î

The commonality between the two murdering scumbags:  They‚Äôre godless psychopaths with way too much firepower.  Period.  Their politics are meaningless, except to ghouls and Beltway politicians.
