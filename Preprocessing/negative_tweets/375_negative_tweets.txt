C: (0.966%) T: @Holdoneasy @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl And the Ohio shooter supported Elizabeth Warren so I guess by your logic we should blame her for her rhetoric, and those were Obama's cages, I assume you hated them back when he utilized them right? ...and Trump has no victims, you're confusing him with the Clinton's body count.

C: (0.980%) T: @BrainGoblin Where is the hypocrisy? Oh here is 1: the Dayton shooter is an Elizabeth Warren worshiper we haven’t heard shit about that &amp;Elizabeth Warren hasn’t been blamed. In contrast the El Paso shooter is a murderer who, according to the left, was following Hitler/trump marching orders
