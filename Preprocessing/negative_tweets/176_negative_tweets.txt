C: (0.994%) T: @ewarren @KICKINGASS2016 Elizabeth Warren is a lying fool.
C: (0.957%) T: Racism is when Native Americans are disrespected‚ÄîThe white supremacy of Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/RDlvuXTWIw Liz exhibited a wide-ranging pattern of dishonesty and contempt for Indigenous communities. That disqualifies her candidacy for 2020 Democratic presidential nomination
C: (0.824%) T: @thewendynerd @TakedownMRAs @ssharmaTX @benshapiro @amazon Do you blame Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Antifa for the Dayton shooting last week?
C: (0.998%) T: @gtconway3d @bobvarsha I hate some of the language that Trump tweets and spouts at rallies but should we blame Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders because the Dayton shooter supported them?
C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Elizabeth Warren never spoke of hate or incited violence and said white supremacy were very fine people. This is just more GOP  bullshit ,trying to redirect away from their Orange Mess.
C: (0.994%) T: Alphabet networks on the El Paso shooting 100% Alphabet networks on the Dayton shooting Crickets. Why? Ans. the Dayton shooter a supporter of Elizabeth Warren aka Pocahontas. Media bias?  HEll YES COMMUNIST.

C: (0.964%) T: @iamcardib The Dayton shooter was a far left wacko, into Satanism, Antifa, and Democrat politics who was planning on voting for Elizabeth Warren. He shot his own sister first! The El Paso shooter was NOT a Trump supporter either. He hated both parties. Knock off the bullshit Cardi.

C: (0.966%) T: @LadyR60961988 @cit_uprising @terilg @NateSilver538 I was ready to pull the plug on her when she acknowledged her pledge to refuse high-dollar fundraisers was a gimmick. Waffling on M4A was the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  https://t.co/r0J8WmQ1vC
C: (0.984%) T: @mommiereba @WordswithSteph @davidhogg111 @KellyannePolls There were 2 mass shootings. The El Paso shooter was a Trump fan, and Trumps hateful rhetoric invited him to shoot up the El Paso Walmart. The 2nd Dayton Ohio shooting appears that he supported Elizabeth Warren but was an Incel with toxic masculinity issues.
C: (1.000%) T: @marknewmandscpl @Enquirer Yes, it was Elizabeth Warren's explicit identification with white supremacists and her steadfast opposition to any restrictions on civilians owning weapons of war that led to the Dayton massacre.  By the way, "Pocohantas" is a racist term, racist.
