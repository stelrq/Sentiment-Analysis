C: (0.999%) T: @teresatomlinson @realDonaldTrump @sendavidperdue I am offended by so much lately on both sides. My God do we blame Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton, Ohio shooting or Bernie Sanders for the congressional massacre in Virginia? If we cannot learn to discuss issues and work through them, we are doomed.
C: (0.999%) T: @Trump454545 @RealMAGASteve Ohio's killer was left on the left of the Berni Sanders's and the Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas communalism but nobody talks to

C: (0.992%) T: He is blaming the Toledo shooting on Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren for that shooter killing so many people. He is bashing congress for no action on guns. He is now saying he is for much more gun control.
C: (0.999%) T: "He was a fan of Antifa. He was a fan of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren." -@realdonaldtrump saying he is being "hit on the left and the right" and "wants to stay out of the fray."  The motherfucker can contradict himself within the same sentence.
C: (0.993%) T: More from @POTUS: "I don't blame Elizabeth Warren and I don't blame Bernie Sanders and I don't blame anybody. These are people who are mentally disturbed."
C: (0.996%) T: @Gloria13172860 @RealtorCary @RepEscobar @RashidaTlaib He has nothing to apologize for!  We arenâ€™t blaming Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for the Dayton deaths! Itâ€™s not their fault. Nor is President Trump responsible for El Paso! Horrific tragedies both but only the shooter owns the blame!!
C: (0.999%) T: @repjohnlewis Now do Ohio and Elizabeth Warren! YOU LIE! This lays at the rhetoric the dems are spewing!  We blame Democrats! #TrumpPence2020

C: (0.998%) T: @ewarren Elizabeth Warren, you're a fraud. Your remarks blaming the #POTUS for the acts of some mentally crazed shooters is despicable &amp; irresponsible. Your fund raising off of this tragedy is a debauchery. You should not &amp; will not ever be President.
