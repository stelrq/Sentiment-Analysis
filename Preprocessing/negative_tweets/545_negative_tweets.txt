C: (0.948%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Elizabeth Warren doesn't have a violent bone in her body. Racism continually spews out of Trump.   Jesus wasn't racist and when you support racist ideology you are racist. Jesus still loves you but wonders WTF is wrong with you.
C: (0.995%) T: Lost in the hate and divisiveness that is now America. #Ideas --&gt;America has a terrible digital divide. @ewarren has a plan for that too. Warren introduced a plan that would allocate $85 billion in federal funds toward developing broadband networks. https://t.co/9p95NgQC1g #2020

C: (0.505%) T: @SenSherrodBrown @DanaWhalen During your bashing of the President of the United States U forgot to mention that this shooter was a Worshipper of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and ANTIFA and was a Leftist.  This shooting had nothing to do With Our GREAT President.
