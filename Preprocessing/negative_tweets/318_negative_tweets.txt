C: (0.959%) T: @JonahNRO The hatred is on both sides. Remember scalise and congressmen running from bullets being shot by a Bernie supporter? Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter! Antifa and Portland? Orlando? New York and a car on the west side bike trail?  Evil exists . Don’t forget the DC snipers!
C: (0.984%) T: @ANobody83 @AlanWindham @benshapiro It wasn't unrelated. The Daytona Ohio loser was an avid fan of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie, and ANTIFA. The El Paso loser was an avid fan of white supremacist. Nothing wrong with saying both exists and are deplorable.

C: (0.986%) T: I’m worried about the election because partisanship and the electoral college makes every national election close. But it’s difficult to see Elizabeth Warren doing worse than Hillary considering she has way less baggage than Hillary did (which I largely don’t blame her for).
