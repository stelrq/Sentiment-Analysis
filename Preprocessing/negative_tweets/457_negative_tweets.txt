C: (0.991%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren Yes, you goofball. Because the killer didn't leave a manifesto quoting Elizabeth Warren's bigotry and racist dialogue.  He did, however play in a band that was masoginistic and wrote songs about raping women, so he's still closer to a Trump than a Warren. You lose.

C: (1.000%) T: @peterdaou @nytimes This is so ridiculous and is why the left will lose again in 2020. By this logic Obama, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie also have blood on their hands
C: (0.994%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The El Paso shooter's ideology PREDATED President Trump! He said so in his manifesto. The Dayton, Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter and a leftist who hated Trump.  So How is this all Trump's fault, Geraldo?, How???
C: (0.992%) T: @CRobska @oliverdarcy What’s unbelievable they say the El Paso guy is Trumps fault but put zero fault with Elizabeth Warren, Jared Holt, AOC and Bernie Sanders for Ohio Shooter
