C: (0.999%) T: @Juliess31 @CNN @CNNOpinion Guess we should blame Obama for the Dallas Sniper, NYPD murders he was quoted. How about. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren they were quoted by Ohio shooter. Garlic Fest shooter who quoted media articles, so media is to blame. What about the other preceding presidents them too?

C: (0.994%) T: @TomiLahren If he was, it’s not because Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sandra or whoever inspired him to hate. Get the difference, Tammy?
C: (0.988%) T: @KellyannePolls Yes. Everyone has heard that. Here's  the difference: Neither Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren have used their platform to promote hate and violence. Nobody on the "left" holds hate rallies or supports racism. Nobody.
