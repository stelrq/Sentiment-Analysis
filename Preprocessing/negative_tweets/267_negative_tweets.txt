C: (0.577%) T: @23_jhawk @BernieSanders @realDonaldTrump The shooter in El Paso was an eco-fascist and the shooter in Dayton was a devout far leftist and Elizabeth Warren supporter.  You cannot blame either of these incidents on @realDonaldTrump.  Bernie (get off my lawn) Sanders is completely irrational and delusional.
