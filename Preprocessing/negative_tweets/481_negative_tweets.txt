C: (1.000%) T: @FallonFireblade @TuckerCarlson Agreed any violent attack is wrong. But Elizabeth Warren is not spreading hate, racism &amp; lies like Trump is. The stats are clear. White supremacy violence is growing. https://t.co/0LhuzA4BpI

C: (0.988%) T: John Cornyn is an idiot if he thinks that Elizabeth Warren's rhetoric inspired a misogynistic, violent young man to shoot people. Trump's rhetoric, on the other hand, IS hateful and dehumanizing: "infestation," "aliens," "invasion." Oh, &amp; smiling when someone shouts "shoot 'em." https://t.co/dKds15Lmtb

C: (0.984%) T: @BrentMcCay Hey, everyone! I donated to Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris and Beto ORourke and Mayor Pete. If you are ashamed or embarrassed about whose campaign receives your money, perhaps you should rethink who you support. BTW no addresses were published! Shame on you for lying.
