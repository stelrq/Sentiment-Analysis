C: (0.993%) T: @kdt471 @politvidchannel I would much prefer this article stated "Elizabeth Warren Just proposed an ANTI-gun violence plan".  Proposing 'a gun violence plan' sounds like Warren's going to lock &amp; load weapons &amp; take on the Republicans Rambo-style.
C: (1.000%) T: @SaraRucraZy @banana_wintour Point is, Obama was in office during the most mass shootings in our history, &amp; the left never once blamed him. Somehow, the El Paso shooter &amp; the Dayton shooter (Elizabeth Warren supporter &amp; ANTIFA sympathizer) are both, somehow Trumps fault. They‚Äôre ü•ú. Every last one of em ü•úüí©
