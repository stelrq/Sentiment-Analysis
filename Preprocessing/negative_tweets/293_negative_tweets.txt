C: (0.832%) T: @BrandyZadrozny @claireatki You are upset that connor betts was a leftist and antifa and elizabeth warren supporter.  So much for objective journalism.
C: (0.549%) T: @TimRunsHisMouth Weird. If we follow the philosophy that the media has been pushing on us, that a pol is somehow directly responsible for the actions of one of their supporters, you'd think he would call for a protest against Elizabeth Warren.  Both are ridiculous. Only the shooter is to blame.
C: (1.000%) T: @RichardDiNatale Showing your utter ignorance and complete hypocrisy again Dick! Do you also blame Elizabeth Warren and AOC for the Dayton, if not why not
C: (0.999%) T: @TravelingUS @realDonaldTrump The Daytona shooter was a Democrat Elizabeth Warren voter he liked antifa and he became very upset after Alexandria Acosta lied about detention centers being concentration camps put that in your pipe and smoke it https://t.co/fSCWScQYCL
C: (0.875%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump What about the maniac in Ohio?  He‚Äôs a Elizabeth Warren supporter.  Quit saying Trump is your friend. You seem to blame him as quickly as his adversaries.
C: (0.996%) T: Nah no way a leftist... So why is everyone talking about Nazi rawhite racist still??? Ohio gunman described himself as pro-Satan 'leftist' who supported Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/Gkhtrx4e0x via @washtimes
C: (0.508%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl Where are Elizabeth Warren  supporters list with employers   https://t.co/qp5lXPmMrU
C: (1.000%) T: @dhanuraashi @nerdythor @MattBruenig @NateSilver538 if elizabeth warren becomes president of the united states i really doubt Bernie will be that upset
C: (0.753%) T: @streiffredstate @LorenSethC @EWErickson The Ohio shooter supported Elizabeth Warren and quoted AOC with her concentration camps lunacy.  Yet the Right knows this is a mentally disturbed person who is to blame.
C: (0.523%) T: @jerryandle @thecjpearson @OleSasquatch @realDonaldTrump Jeez you sound like those trump  conspiracy theorists. But nonetheless I'm just gonna go ahead and blame Elizabeth Warren for making people hate Trump so much that it incited them to beat and go on a mass shooting spree too, because that is also the same what you complain about
C: (0.508%) T: Elizabeth Warren Up, Kamala Harris Down in New Post-Debate National Poll https://t.co/169A7MJg4V via @mediaite
C: (0.508%) T: @repjohnlewis Now do Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.996%) T: Hmmm, the El Paso shooter was an anti-illegal alien, ultra-segregationist and environmentalist?   The Dayton shooter was an ANTIFA, Elizabeth Warren supporter? https://t.co/PDwpUZN6cR
C: (0.993%) T: @Echong @NBCNews left-wing wacko! MSM going to go after Pocahontas &amp; Squadsters for inciting hate &amp; terror?!  https://t.co/fqexLDaZyj https://t.co/ejiy1BTRNT
C: (0.508%) T: @CNN And.....supported Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.508%) T: Kellyanne Conway Targets Beto, Elizabeth Warren: 'I'm Going To Name and Shame' https://t.co/2AtPLLjUR9
C: (1.000%) T: @BravoJuneau @CNNPolitics So, by your reasoning, Obama was responsible for all of the many mass shootings and cop killings during his Presidency. In addition, AOC is responsible for the fire bombing attack at the ICE facility and Elizabeth Warren is to blame for Dayton, OH. Personal responsibility is gone
C: (0.508%) T: tfw Elizabeth Warren has a plan for that https://t.co/u3nrj2nQfG
C: (0.516%) T: @GeraldoRivera @4everameric @realDonaldTrump You are full of crap and part of the problem. How about blaming the Elizabeth Warren fan shooter?
C: (0.508%) T: FYI: The Dayton Shooter Was Pro-Antifa and Wanted to Vote For Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/hHUxOsduqR
C: (0.956%) T: It‚Äôs idiotic to say that the Dayton shooting was a case of leftist political violence. The man had a ‚Äúrape list‚Äù of women whom he hated. The predicting factor wasn‚Äôt his support for Elizabeth Warren, it was his violent misogyny.
C: (0.999%) T: @sandy_scissor @charliekirk11 Fine.  At Fault: *Donald *Maxine (assuming you‚Äôre right)  Not at fault (still) *Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.986%) T: Oh hell no, that's not how it works. @ewarren has blood on her hands... That's how they do it... Live by your own rules. https://t.co/eaQvkxskb2
C: (0.800%) T: @waydownLo @99_lead @TimMurtaugh @RealSaavedra You mean like that leftist Elizabeth Warren supporter in Ohio?  Man too bad we weren‚Äôt shaming him for donating to Warren, maybe we could‚Äôve got to him before it was too late &amp; he got radicalized by your socialist, antifa leftist ideology.
