C: (0.986%) T: @jorgereyes @mviser Dayton - Antifa Leftist stoked by Elizabeth Warren. See how it works?  Inflammatory rhetoric stokes fires in human pieces of garbage. Both sides,  Bucko.

However it's not trumps fault, and it's not elizabeth Warren's fault either (dayton shooter was inspired by her). All acts of hate no matter the political affiliation r disgusting and they have no place.
