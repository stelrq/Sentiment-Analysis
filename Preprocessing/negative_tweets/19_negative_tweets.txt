C: (0.999%) T: @NYCEllieD @WalkerWhitman @RVAwonk Yes you are, it's a fact that the Dayton killer retweeted elizabeth Warren/other leftists and was extremely pro left and incited violence against conservatives. Again, you cant have it both ways. Call it out for what it is, they are both deranged terrorists.
