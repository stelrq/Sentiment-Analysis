C: (1.000%) T: @HowardKurtz @marthamaccallum BECAUSE THAT’S NOT THE REASON THAT HE DID WHAT HE DID YOU UNBELIEVABLE MORON. What the hell is wrong with you? One shooter had a manifesto explocitomg citing his politics as the reason for his murder. One “liked” Elizabeth Warren. Are you seriously this stupid?
C: (0.995%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Mr Trump, you have been spewing hate speech even before you spread conspiracy theories about President Obama with your birther lies. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders never encouraged the fear hatred of minorities and immigrants. Now you're feeling sorry for yourself...too bad!

C: (0.666%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN The difference is Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders aren't encouraging their supporters to shoot migrants in the Panhandle, or anywhere else for that matter.

C: (0.998%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN It’s the Divider in Chief! Elizabeth Warren has never laughed at a rally when someone suggested shooting immigrants. She doesn’t call immigrants “invaders”. She has never incited her audience to “kick the crap” out of anyone. Because she’s not a violent racist, and you are. 👋🏼
C: (0.987%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders don't peddle in divisive, dehumanizing language. You do.
C: (0.842%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Meanwhile, there is still no political motive for the Dayton shooting proven. The shooter seems to have been a person who ran amok for personal reasons. AND: Neither Bernie Sanders nor Elizabeth Warren have ever promoted violence.

Are people in office would grow up and stop playing politics and actually do their jobs this would stop. The Dayton shooter was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren

C: (0.983%) T: 3/ supremacist crowd. The Daily Stormer thinks Trump is part of their tribe. There is not one syllable uttered by Elizabeth Warren or any other Democrat in this country calling for violence against anybody, least of all GOPers. So, @PostOpinions apologize for this disgraceful
