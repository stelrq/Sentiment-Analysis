C: (0.569%) T: @RobertMaguire_ Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter.  El Paso was a radical environmentalist.  Neither were white supremacists.  Fake reporting

C: (0.657%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump So. Dayton shooter was a Democrat, Elizabeth Warren supporter, &amp; El Paso shooter said he hated both political parties, &amp; was driven to the shooting by the policies of Democrat presidential candidates.  This is Donald Trump's fault, HOW exactly?
C: (0.558%) T: @watspn1013 @TimRunsHisMouth @wilitigate02 You mean we cannot say the Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren fan, a radical Dem and Antifa fan. But why.  Elizabeth Warren should get in on the blame game too, after all, the Democrats call for violence, hate, racism to Repubs and anyone who disagrees with them. Dems own it.
C: (0.762%) T: @maketruthandfa1 @traciemac_Bmore @ewarren @senatemajldr Ohio shooter gave support for Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. We have had massacres for years. The people to blame for shootings are perpetrators. Thank u Trump not blaming Warren and Sanders

C: (0.999%) T: @realDonaldTrump Agreed! What about Elizabeth warren? Is it her fault? And both shooters hated Trump! So tired of this double standard non-sense! I canâ€™t wait til 2020 to see how Trump was somehow a Chinese spy this time ðŸ˜‚ &amp; thatâ€™s how he won again in a landslide this time of mass proportions!! https://t.co/UdB7lezsS3

C: (0.818%) T: @Goss30Goss @ewarren @senatemajldr Is Elizabeth Warren and Bernie responsible to blame for Ohio shooting? Trump says no. So why blame him for shootings.
C: (0.986%) T: @SpecOp3g @TheDailyShow @jack_p Got evidence that the Dayton's shooters political beliefs motivated his shootings?   Got some examples of violent, dehumanizing rhetoric from Elizabeth Warren?  Didn't think so.
