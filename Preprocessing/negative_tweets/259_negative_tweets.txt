C: (0.849%) T: @BernieSanders Leave the guns alone, Bernie. Ban idiots that hate and kill.  They come in all stripes. The one in Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. The Alexandria, VA shooter, James Hodgkinson, was a left-wing activist, working for the Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign. It's not the guns.
