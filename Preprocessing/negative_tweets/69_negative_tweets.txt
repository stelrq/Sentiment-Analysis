C: (0.980%) T: @BarbaracOnline @Conruthhoward Exactly. And CNN (the so-called "radical left media Trump "hates") will help Trump win, by running Elizabeth Warren "native problem just got worse" articles. What a scam. https://t.co/Z7hmCSL1ru
C: (0.999%) T: @jessphoenix2018 @marklevinshow Donald Trump is a hate-peddling pathological liar who shouldn't be within 10 miles of Elizabeth Warren.
C: (1.000%) T: @banikarim Joe Biden calls Trump supporters “dregs of society.” Kamala Harris calls Trump a predator, Elizabeth Warren: “Trump is a white supremacist”, Bernie Sanders labels Trump a racist bigot, scam artist, liar, fraud, a narcissist, a bully, an idiot and a demagogue. THEY incite!
C: (1.000%) T: @Liz_Wheeler Elizabeth Warren is a real threat to our Constitution and Bill of Rights. If she gains power our country is going to be usurped by an evil Queen almost as diabolical and nefarious as Hillary Clinton.

C: (0.509%) T: @kdittmar @CAWP_RU @melinamara @kelsey_kremer @electgarrick @iamchampa @AP @ewarren The idea that Elizabeth Warren is unlikeable is one of the stupidest tropes in politics.
C: (0.998%) T: @FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump @BernieSanders The shooter in Ohio was a Bernie/Elizabeth Warren supporter.   Shouldn’t  Bernie take responsibility?   In fact, it was a Bernie supporter who shot the republican senators.   Maybe Bernie should tone down the rhetoric.
