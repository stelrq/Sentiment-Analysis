C: (0.995%) T: @jayell2571 @charliekirk11 I think there's a HUGE gray line of distinction! But to blame Trump for one of his supporters doing something so heinous, but not blame Elizabeth Warren for one of her supporters doing something horrible as well... That's a clear double standard.
C: (0.508%) T: @BreitbartNews THERE IS AN INVASION GOING ON, AND A SOCIALIST WHO SUPPORTED ELIZABETH WARREN KILLED 20 PEOPLE.  THE PRESIDENT GOES WHERE HE WANTS TO GO.  ESCOBAR CAN GO TO HELL!
C: (0.668%) T: Msm and Democrats blame  the President for the shootings! Why aren’t they blaming Elizabeth Warren as the Dayton shooter was going to vote for her and blame bernie sanders for the shooting at a Republican baseball field where Steve Scalise was seriously injured!   Ridiculous!
C: (0.508%) T: @TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC DON'T FORGET OHIO SHOOTER WAS A DEMOCRAT SO DEMOCRATS ARE CAUSED THIS SHOOTING AND HE FOLLOWED ELIZABETH WARREN SO SHE IS RESPONSIBLE TO AND BERNIE SANDERS FOR THE REPUBLICANS BEINGS SHOT AND OBAMA FOR THE SANDY HOOK SHOOTINGS 2 CAN PLAY THE BLAME GAME. YOUR THE DEVIL
C: (0.771%) T: @charliekirk11 If you’re blaming Elizabeth Warren for the acts of mass shooter, and you’re not also blaming Papa John’s Pizza and Nike Sneakers or Charmin Toilet Paper then you’re a political hack with zero credibility.
C: (0.542%) T: @johnpike15 @mestasenesta The gunman's manifesto was not "right wing" he spoke of population control, global warming, concentration camps and many other "progressive" positions. He was an evil deranged monster. The Dayton shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter

C: (0.999%) T: @AOC A liberal Elizabeth Warren supporter shot up the people in Dayton. A liberal Bernie Sanders supporter shot up members of the Republican congressional softball team in Washington DC. Your rhetoric is the source of the problem.
