C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @CNN It‚Äôs clear that this jerk called Chris Cuomo ‚ÄúFredo‚Äù as a racist slur. Like when Trump calls Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas.  But when‚Äîsay‚ÄîEric Trump is called Fredo, it has its original meaning‚Äîthe most incompetent of several evil siblings.  The n-word only has 1 meaning, tho.
C: (0.501%) T: @PolitiBunny @DavidIanRobin @BernieSanders Like the GOP made the rest of us pay for the bank‚Äôs mistakes during the last financial meltdown in 2008, how quickly we forget. Elizabeth Warren warned us against the banks practices, the politicians from both sides ignored her, she was right, and now we are paying still.
C: (0.990%) T: @HillaryClinton Just last week, a Democratic-Socialist who supports Elizabeth Warren's bid for president, shot and killed his sister and 9 other. An additional 27 people were injured. May we drop the rhetoric and start to heal the rift in American society.
