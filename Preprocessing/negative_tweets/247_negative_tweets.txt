C: (1.000%) T: @Proxy_Tank @guypbenson @realDonaldTrump Call evil for what it is Evil! R u going to blame Elizabeth Warren for Ohio? Or Obama who had over 24 mass shootings on his watch..or how about Chicago over 1000 shootings this year! It‚Äôs no ones fault but the killers!
C: (1.000%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump How do you account for ties to ANTIFA? Dayton killer was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Where‚Äôs your outrage toward Warren? You know it‚Äôs wrong to tie sick evil people to our President. Stop your hate-filled rhetoric. You‚Äôre an embarrassment to Texas.
C: (1.000%) T: WSJ: The Dayton killer was a left-winger, but don't blame Elizabeth Warren  https://t.co/pTpm2itJCb Yes tit for tat. ‚Å¶@SenWarren‚Å© and her divisive comments are inciting violence.
C: (1.000%) T: @lisascraftylife @brookefoxnews @Castro4Congress The Trump base is completely jacked up on fake news fear that they are always under attack from Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs antifa death squads. It‚Äôs probably why they think he‚Äôs such a tough guy standing up to all the communist bullies on the left. It‚Äôs quite insane.

C: (0.977%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Geraldo, you're an atty.  Smart.  Truth is, has nothing to do with Pres. Trump words.  Has to do with far-left ppl wanting him out of White House.  Ohio shooter was an Elizabeth Warren backer.  He wanted her into WH.
C: (0.831%) T: @JoeNBC So by your logic ELIZABETH Warren is to blame for Dayton and aoc is to blame for Washington and Obama is to blame for Dallas cops. Got it
