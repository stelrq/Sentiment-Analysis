C: (0.535%) T: @kimguilfoyle Shouldn't they be proud to support someone they believe in so much that they're donating money? I'm confused on how that's hateful. I donated to Elizabeth Warren once. I'm not ashamed.
C: (0.509%) T: @PaulVolk4 @riza_blade @eugenegu @ewarren @realDonaldTrump I see no quotes from Elizabeth Warren that condones or incites violence. Again, where are they?
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren @senatemajldr Elizabeth Warren is promoting violence through her endless rhetoric and identity politics.  She should step down and suspend her campaign immediately.  See how that works, Lizzie? Stop with your nonsense.

C: (0.989%) T: @don2deliver @ThomasMazze @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @SenWarren Elizabeth Warren isn't a socialist. Bernie Sanders is a Democratic Socialist.
