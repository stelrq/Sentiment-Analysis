C: (1.000%) T: @secretstranger9 Too bad Booker. It's not Rally's that are causing this hate. It's people like you spewing your hateful rhetoric. It's the lying CNN and MSNBC news outlets pushing hate, violence and lies. The shooter supported socialism and Elizabeth Warren.   https://t.co/wN24cfTMUq

C: (0.999%) T: @don2deliver @ThomasMazze @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @SenWarren Elizabeth Warren isn't a socialist. She's just not. Even the Obama quote you attribute to her doesn't mean what it's been distorted to mean.

C: (0.998%) T: @chrislhayes What? You mean it had nothing to do with all of Elizabeth Warren's violent, hate-filled rhetoric to go off and kill random people based on nothing but the fact they're people? ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ You don't say?! The MAGA cult doesn't understand the difference between Dayton and El Paso.
