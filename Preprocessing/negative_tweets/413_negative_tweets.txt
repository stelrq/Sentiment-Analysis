C: (1.000%) T: @NomeDaBarbarian @UrbanWeirdo @daveweigel @nycsouthpaw @KristenOrthman You are on the wrong side. There is nothing in Elizabeth Warren’s speeches and ideas that supports violence.
C: (0.986%) T: Why not she laid El Paso at Trump's feet .  Oh that's right she's a woman and a Democrat. WSJ: The Dayton killer was a left-winger, but don't blame Elizabeth Warren  https://t.co/9aVUXFn2F4
C: (0.988%) T: @washingtonpost FYI : I have donated to Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. I am not hiding it nor am I ashamed. #ownyourdonation #publicrecords
C: (0.671%) T: @TheRealTBone @GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Why?...Because of a crazed person’s interpretation.  The Dayton shooter was a crazy sworn ‘leftist’ who admired Elizabeth Warren.  The nut who shot Scalise liked Bernie.  Do you have meaningful conversations with disturbed homeless who talk to themselves?

C: (1.000%) T: @cassiqu @hharrisonCBS7 @CBS7News It is wrong to blame Trump for the acts of a crazy person. Do you see anybody blaming Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton attack?
C: (1.000%) T: @sallybmccarty @krassenstein45 @RashidaTlaib @jimkelly522 Bullshit. the fucking idiot who shot people at Daytona was a fracking Elizabeth Warren supporter and a member of Antifa, your party's pseudo- Sturmabteilung. Spare us of that whitewashing Bullshit.
C: (0.997%) T: @Veronica2twit1 @Newsday What does that have to do with the Dayton Shooter undeniably not being a Trump Supporter?  You are tweeting about Dayton and a Democrat very clearly was the shooter in Dayton.   Are you going to pretend that it was not an Elizabeth Warren supporter who murdered people in Dayton?

C: (0.992%) T: @bennyjohnson @Cernovich STOP  No one spews hate like Donnie...not Elizabeth Warren   Nor Bernie Sanders   LITERALLY NO ONE IS AS VILE RACIST AND HATEFUL.. He speaks and people take up the charge!
C: (0.998%) T: @Dantegigas1 @padricgleason @WhiteHouse By your logic; Obama’s anti cop rhetoric caused the massacre of 5 police officers in Texas, Bernie Sanders is responsible for the shooting of Republicans in a baseball field, and Elizabeth Warren caused the shooting in Ohii

C: (0.988%) T: @nanwhaley @SenSherrodBrown @realDonaldTrump Most gun shootings were in Obama divisive years yet you r silent. A radical left wing socialist nut job in Dayton who loves Elizabeth Warren killed many! He should have been stopped long ago; both of you r part of the problem! Vile attacks on POTUS must stop now!
C: (0.508%) T: @ewarren Because the Shooter in Dayton was a Elizabeth Warren supporter that makes you a White supremacist
C: (0.659%) T: @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump None of this would be going on if the dems would work to keep illegals out!!! It's their fault! The Dayton shooter was a democrat and supporter of Elizabeth Warren! Which you are not hearing on msm!!! Nothing knew!!!
C: (1.000%) T: @slpng_giants @USAA If conservatives are promoting hate, then so are Progressives  The El Paso shooter wants conservative!- he wanted environmentalism UBI national healthcare.   The Daytona shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, has connections to antifa and hated Republicans on Fox News
C: (0.987%) T: @MitchKSmith Why the hell are these people protesting Trump, when the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter!?!?
