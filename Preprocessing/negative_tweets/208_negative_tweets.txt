C: (1.000%) T: @TomSteyer Elizabeth Warren trying to inflame racial tensions by repeating a lie that had been proven to be a lie about Police in Ferguson Missouri. That is the Tom Steyer and generally the democrat standard operating procedure. Not healthy for our country https://t.co/D0hnZ2d9Ul

C: (0.552%) T: @TomiLahren Oh did he have a "manifesto" about how Elizabeth Warren radicalized him into shooting his sister?  Nah? Well maybe he shouldn't have had such easy access to weapons. Support gun control if people like him concern you bitch.

C: (0.725%) T: @ABC Facts:  Dayton shooter was huge ANTIFA supporter. Supported Elizabeth Warren.  Had rape lists. Had kill lists. Hated Christians.  An avowed Satanist.  Hated Trump.  Trump had ZERO to do with it
C: (1.000%) T: @IlhanMN Reminder his manifesto said to blame this on Trump would be fake news to quote him directly. So should we blame the Dayton shooter on Elizabeth Warren?
C: (0.992%) T: Nice overview of @SenWarren's career in education; by all accounts, Elizabeth #Warren was a great professor. A fear is that Warren's questions and sharpness will "intimidate" voters. Not those who have had it with our incurious, no-nothing, prevaricating incumbent. https://t.co/O1Uk1W1c1q
C: (0.994%) T: @DerekEBoucher That’s nonsense, in his own “manifesto” he knew psychotic leftists would say this.  He clearly wrote that his views were formed long ago.  Trump is no more responsible than Elizabeth Warren is in Dayton.  Cut the crap.
C: (0.508%) T: FYI: The Dayton Shooter Was Pro-Antifa and Wanted to Vote For Elizabeth Warren https://t.co/ETkyipGeu0
C: (0.821%) T: @repjohnlewis Hats wrong for you to say that trump is responsible.  Fact is you say trump for Texas but the thug that shot up Ohio said Elizabeth warren name.  Trump or Warren is not responsibile for either.  Quit blame gaming.  It just wrong.  No one is responsible but the person that did it.
C: (0.992%) T: Unbelievable! The liberals stump for gun control some for even disarming us, and blame Trump for every violent happening in our country even when a shooter hates Trump and is a follower of Elizabeth Warren.   What will they say about this evil movie... https://t.co/541jOtXLf0
