C: (1.000%) T: @Jerusalem_Post @ADL Crapola.   The El Paso killer was an environmentalist mad that Dems we’re letting in so many foreigners to wreck our country. Racist pig.

C: (1.000%) T: @M2theKmF @pgammo Her name is Elizabeth Warren, and who the shooter supported is irrelevant. Unlike the El Paso shooter, the Dayton shooter did not kill for political reasons or leave a manifesto. Oh, and Warren has never used racist rhetoric that encouraged violence. Unlike Trump.
