C: (0.529%) T: @BetoORourke That is so irresponsible of Beto O‚ÄôRourke. Trump is no more responsible for the shooting deaths in El Paso then Obama was for the Orlando shooter, San Berdino shooters or Elizabeth Warren was for the Dayton Ohio shooter.
C: (1.000%) T: If morons, Biden &amp; Beto O‚ÄôRourke are going to blame President Trump for Crusius killing 20 in El Paso, Texas, then I blame Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Beto O‚ÄôRourke, Corey Booker &amp;Joe Biden for the Socialist, ANTIFA member killing 9 in Dayton, Ohio. https://t.co/McN6nVbtYE

C: (0.727%) T: @robreiner Isn‚Äôt it interesting you leave out the liberal Bernie/Elizabeth Warren supporter that killed 9 people? Because you‚Äôre a fraud! Did you blame Obama for every mass shooter when he was in office? What about the police officers murdered in Dallas at a BLM protest under Obama?
