C: (0.541%) T: How are these white liberal news reporters and anchors dumping on white Americans when they themselves are white. Are they planning on pulling an Elizabeth Warren and lie about their ethnicity claim they are African-Americans or Native Americans?

C: (1.000%) T: @GlowingEz @k2323 @KaceyMusgraves Unless some Elizabeth Warren loving freak like the Dayton killer decides to shoot everyone because of Warren’s hateful rhetoric.
C: (0.994%) T: @nanwhaley @ryandaytime Amazing that you chose to blame @realDonaldTrump when the shooter was identified as a democrat, Satanist, who supported Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. So disturbing that you're using this tragedy for 15 minutes of fame. #Hack
C: (1.000%) T: @NurseTiffm78 @fawfulfan @david_shane @JoeNBC In general it’s the Trump voters that are armed to the teeth. We liberals are usually mild mannered quiche eating peaceniks. And mocked for it. I mean, compare Trump rallies to Elizabeth Warren fests. Come on, no comparison.

C: (0.539%) T: @BrandonStraka Did I miss the Dayton shooters manifesto quoting Elizabeth Warren and literally carrying out her instructions to get rid of brown people? You racists think the rest of the world is as stupid and thick as your cult? Is embarrassing to watch.
C: (1.000%) T: @rayk58 The real horror was in Dayton where The Elizabeth Warren Shooter, inspired by the hateful rhetoric of the socialist left leaders like @ewarren mowed down dozens in cold blood.  @ewareen owes this country an apology.  Socialism is a mental illness
