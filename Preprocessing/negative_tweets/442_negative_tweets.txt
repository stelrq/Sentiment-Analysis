C: (0.998%) T: Tonight’s 10 o’clock Detroit Fox2 News ignored it. They reported Ohio police didn't know shooters  motives. Misleading shameful   Media Ignores How Dayton Shooter Was Liberal Who Supported Pro-Abortion Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders https://t.co/avCbblsKxF
C: (0.976%) T: @Francis28919584 @SilentTrumper @JoeTrues @MAHDIMAJIDI8 @EricRaskin1 @putinsgay @keanothedog @realDonaldTrump So let’s solve the problem by calling Elizabeth Warren supporters white supremacist.  And leave out that he’s an Elizabeth Warren supporter.
C: (0.676%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump You mean the guy who worshiped Elizabeth Warren? Or the 1 that wanted to be involved with ANTIFA. I'm confused. Neither had anything g to do with Trump you asshat
C: (0.508%) T: @nickkrueger5 @PatGarofalo The Dayton shooter supports Elizabeth Warren, ANTIFA, and socialism.
C: (0.922%) T: @outandaboutjc1 @blocks_learning @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl This is just a blatant lie. Trump didn’t incite anyone to kill Hispanics.  He might not say and tweet all the right things, but this is a fat lie. No one blames Elizabeth Warren for the Dayton shooter. No one blames Bernie Sanders for the baseball field shooter.

C: (1.000%) T: @charliekirk11 Dude, just don’t. A guy in El Paso just killed 20 people and it was racial motivated and he said so. Trying to turn it because I guy in Dayton leaned left is ridiculous. When someone shot Steve Scalise that was terrorism too. But Elizabeth Warren is asking people to shoot others

C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren Today I was asked if Elizabeth Warren is a good rep.... I said it depends if a good rep is a liar fake and a crook. But your time is coming to an end @ewarren you’re going to be disgraced bankrupt and probably in prison those who scream the loudest
C: (1.000%) T: @ewarren He is not. YOU Elizabeth Warren are the hate you project to hate.  Do y our own inventory.  You Democrats agenda is to feed and fuel hate and division with any disregard, it is as if your demonic Dem party is trying to incite violence toward Trump and all who support him.
