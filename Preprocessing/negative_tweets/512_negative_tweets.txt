C: (0.963%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren You don‚Äôt blame Elizabeth Warren because you are NOT a racist or bigot.  Most of us know that it wasn‚Äôt a candidate or ‚Äúparty‚Äù that initiated the attacks, it‚Äôs the democrats using it for political partisanship (again).  Remind me, WHY would a person vote Democratic?

C: (0.819%) T: @razrbaxwin @perchance99 @SteveScalise @MattWolking Republicans don't support either shooting dummy. We, 99%, don't support violence against others. It's why antifa beats us up and we don't attack back. Besides one of the shooters (Dayton) was a leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren. Learn to read.
C: (0.950%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Tell you what, turns out the Dayton killer shouted "Medicare for all", wrote radical posts about raising the marginal tax rate and when all this is brought to Elizabeth Warren she responds with: "there's some disturbed people on both sides of this issue" THEN we'll all @ her üëå
