C: (0.994%) T: @artboypolitico @marybl62 @SirajAHashmi @yashar Oh? You mean the registered Democrat in El Paso, the anti-religious Democrat in Gilroy, and the Elizabeth Warren supporter in Dayton were all Republicans?
C: (1.000%) T: @ben_literal @johnpavlovitz @realDonaldTrump So he's responsible for Elizabeth Warren's acolyte, but she isn't? How can Democrats shoot people and President Trump gets blamed but Democrats who tell people to attack him don't? All the hate speech is coming from the Left! So is all the violence.

C: (1.000%) T: @RealClearNews Elizabeth Warren is a radical socialist?  Even Bernie Sanders, outside the US, is barely left of center.  Oh, and this writer thinks Trump has led the US back to prosperity. LOL  @HeartlandDiary's column is ridiculous.
C: (0.898%) T: @JulianCastro The shooter in Dayton was also a radical leftist who supported Elizabeth Warren.  But you don't mention that. How come?  You can't blame trump on it that's why. You &amp;your party are disgusting

C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke 9 people are dead in Dayton, Ohio due to Elizabeth Warren's hateful rhetoric if you want to play that game. You are a hypocritical fool. You are an embarrassment to the great state of Texas. You should be ashamed of yourself even trying to blame the president.
C: (0.958%) T: @JoanneRN123 @KimStrassel @DonaldJTrumpJr @Castro4Congress Also, Dayton was an Elizabeth Warren and Antifa supporter. Get up to speed on the issue and hold Maxine Waters and Corey Booker accountable for the violence they sow.
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBCPR @JulianCastro @TheLastWord @Lawrence @MSNBC Your hateful speech during these shootings and playing blame it all on Trump is atrocious.  Both shooters were AOC and Elizabeth Warren fans.  Republicans are not going after these people stating its AOC and Warren‚Äôs fault.  Talk love and unity not continued hate.
