C: (0.738%) T: @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Hey dumbass! Both the El Paso and Dayton Morons were REGISTERED DEMOCRATS!   The Dayton jerk-off was a Elizabeth Warren Supporter. There is ZERO evidence that @POTUS inspired these attacks.   Maybe you should decry Warren for fundraising on her supporter’s mass murder!

C: (0.966%) T: @KOLDNews And once again you fail to mention he was an Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders supporter. You’d be screaming like crazy if he was a Trump supporter. Or comparing him to Trump like with the El Paso if he mentioned racism. Media is just as guilty as the shooters.

C: (0.518%) T: @nanwhaley Why don't you tell Protesters to go after Elizabeth Warren when the shooter in Dayton, Ohio was a fan of Elizabeth Warren and espoused views of Bernie Sanders?  Why because it is disgusting to blame others and rile up protesters for something that is not their fault.
C: (1.000%) T: @CoryBooker The Dayton shooter was a Leftist Warren guy, who took his rhetoric from You Tube's Jared Holt, using your logic Elizabeth Warren is directly responsible for the deaths in Ohio. Your a shameless huckster trying to profit on tragedy because you can't beat @realDonaldTrump fairly. https://t.co/U918ZhMVqB
