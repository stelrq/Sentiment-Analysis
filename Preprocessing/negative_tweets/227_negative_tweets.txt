C: (0.986%) T: @alias_penname @ewarren These facts?   "He had posted tweets that opposed Donald Trump and supported Elizabeth Warren, socialism, and Satan.... he had retweeted posts that supported the antifa movement and opposed ICE agents and police officers."  Lizzie's angry rhetoric drove this. Can't ignore facts.
