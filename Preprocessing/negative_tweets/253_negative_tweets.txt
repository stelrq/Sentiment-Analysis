C: (0.999%) T: @JohnWDean Typical left ignoring of facts to support far-left drivel. His past is full of Democrat hatred, with support for ANTIFA and Elizabeth Warren. You've proven you aren't truthful. You are a felon with no credibility. Why continue to humiliate yourself? Truth is lost on you.

C: (0.775%) T: @BetoORourke The racism is coming from the 24/7 left wing media.  YOU are responsible for stroking the fires of hate.  Trump isn’t a racist. The Dayton shooter was clearly a left winger inspired by Elizabeth Warren and the Texas shooter lined more up with Bernie Sanders socialist views https://t.co/bhO6mZdtwl
