C: (0.701%) T: @robreiner Horrific slaughter of innocent people was the result of liberal Democrat followers of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren. You are such an insufferable idiot; why is it so hard 4U2 admit that Dems are evil racists bent on destroying our country?

C: (0.996%) T: President Trump on the news the killer in Dayton was a pro-Antifa leftist: "I don't blame Elizabeth Warren and I don't blame Bernie Sanders in the case of Ohio, and I don't blame anybody. …These are sick people, these are people that are really mentally ill, mentally disturbed." https://t.co/zUTHlunB5P

C: (0.945%) T: @WallyWallner @Tazee_k @SamCrowley @shaunking @realDonaldTrump Elizabeth Warren never joked about shooting anyone. The Dayton shooter was a rapey, misogynist piece of shot like your prez.
C: (0.999%) T: @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Total bullshit. The Dayton shooter didn’t shoot up the bar to kill republicans in the name of the democrats and antifa or Elizabeth Warren. The El Paso shooter spelled TRUMP with his guns, cited trumps words in his manifesto and targeted Hispanics. Stfu.

C: (1.000%) T: Democrats are using these shootings as political talking points and everybody in America should denounce them. It's disgusting what they're doing. And they're not mentioning Elizabeth Warren's shooter in Ohio.
C: (0.837%) T: Again for @charliekirk11,  There is no evidence yet that the suspect in the Dayton shooting was motivated because of anything said by Elizabeth Warren.  The El Paso domestic terrorist explained why he did it using the same anti-immigrant rhetoric as Trump. https://t.co/20eWBPzCRB
