C: (0.986%) T: @CoryBooker hey you bald-headed loser, why don't you talk about the Dayton Ohio shooting? Is it because the shooter was an Elizabeth Warren supporter??
C: (0.999%) T: @charliekirk11 @ewarren This is a textbook false equivalence, bozo. Elizabeth Warren has never used inflammatory rhetoric to incite her base to violence, never condoned violence. In fact, just the opposite.
C: (0.988%) T: @SenBooker hey bald-headed senator, why don't you talk about the Dayton Ohio shooting? Is it because that killer was a leftist and Elizabeth Warren supporter?? You hypocrite!
C: (0.988%) T: @MelanieLDeal76 @MoniqueWorthy No they have you confused with Elizabeth Warren
C: (0.900%) T: @hrtablaze @realDonaldTrump @OANN But while Trump has repeatedly referred to Latinos as invaders that need to be stopped, laughing as someone in his crowd suggested shooting them, Elizabeth Warren never called for McConnell to be stabbed in the heart.   See if you can spot the difference.

C: (0.508%) T: @RoArquette Nope, Elizabeth Warren does.
C: (1.000%) T: @MSNBC @NicolleDWallace @chrislhayes And I'm guessing the people of Dayton don't want Elizabeth Warren going there. You're all demented. Everyone points blame except where it squarely lies, with the sick lunatics that did these horrific acts.

C: (1.000%) T: @BetoORourke So then when are you chastising Elizabeth Warren, AOC and Bernie Sanders for the Dayton shooting? I have news for you Robert Francis, you aren’t fooling anyone with your garbage. You and some of your colleagues have shamefully disgraced our political landscape beyond repair.
C: (0.999%) T: Yoo Hoo -&gt; @lin_mat19 &lt;- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said she's "heartbroken" about the shootings, which left 31 people dead, then asked for money for Sens. Doug Jones (D-AL) and Tina Smith (D-MN) in their respective Senate campaigns. https://t.co/p7InSwKNr1

C: (0.981%) T: @ewarren He tried to take the officer's gun, after committing a strong arm robbery. Elizabeth Warren hates police officers and law abiding Americans citizens.
