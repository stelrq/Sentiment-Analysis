C: (0.821%) T: @repjohnlewis Hats wrong for you to say that trump is responsible.  Fact is you say trump for Texas but the thug that shot up Ohio said Elizabeth warren name.  Trump or Warren is not responsibile for either.  Quit blame gaming.  It just wrong.  No one is responsible but the person that did it.

C: (0.999%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Elizabeth Warren is not a woman hating misogynistic pig. Dayton killer wasn‚Äôt inspired to kill by her.  El Paso killer was totally inspired to kill by a few racist pigs who say there‚Äôs a Hispanic invasion, most notably Trump and YOU, KKKornyn.
