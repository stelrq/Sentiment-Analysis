C: (0.998%) T: @3_stacked @nigeaux @janaethebaee Did trump personally ask the El Paso shooter to do that? No. Did Elizabeth Warren directly ask the Dayton shooter to do that? No. Rhetoric is bad, yes, but that does not mean he’s responsible. Grow up.

C: (1.000%) T: How dare AOC claim that President Trump is directly responsible for the mass shootings in El Paso!! Does that mean Elizabeth Warren is directly responsible for the shooting in  Dayton Ohio? If course not! So this rhetoric needs to end NOW.
C: (1.000%) T: That's because the shooter didn't leave a manifesto using the same hateful language Elizabeth Warren used as his justification for the shooting. You stupid idiot. https://t.co/QJQeFL0V3b

C: (0.999%) T: @atrupar @sirDukeDevin Kelly Anne, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are not calling immigrants an invasion, infestation, criminal, rapists, drug dealers,and so much more. You know trumps rhetoric incites violence. Admit it. Your not that stupid,are you?
C: (1.000%) T: They're so blind to white supremacy.   Kellyanne Conway faces a furious backlash after linking Elizabeth Warren to Dayton massacre  https://t.co/ZyfnsfU6Bb
C: (1.000%) T: @T_Schaefer_ Elizabeth Warren is not responsible for the Dayton massacre even though the killer is pro-Warren. Trump is neither responsible for the El Paso but all the Democratic presidential candidates are blaming Trump. Also I see CNN, yahoo, google etc blame Trump for the El Paso killing.
C: (1.000%) T: @RachelD34535677 @JoaquinCastrotx @jewishaction Does that mean the left radicalised the shooter in Ohio who loved Elizabeth Warren and hated Trump? You Lefties have lost the plot.

C: (0.511%) T: @BetoORourke The Ohio shooter was a self-described socialist &amp; Elizabeth Warren fan. Do we blame @AOC and her squad?  No-we dont  We don’t blame anyone but the shooter.  @BetoORourke U are a coward for blaming Trump supporters for El Paso.  Rest assure, U will never be President
