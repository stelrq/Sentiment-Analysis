C: (1.000%) T: @CatherineCNN @its_xristina Did you also write the shooter in Dayton had writings about being a Far Left, ANTIFA supporter? Did you fairly report that he was an Elizabeth Warren supporter??  Does any of that even matter?  The Ohio shooter was Leftist. The TX. Shooter was racist. Both sick, crazed, people.
