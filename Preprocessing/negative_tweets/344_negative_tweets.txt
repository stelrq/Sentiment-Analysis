C: (0.666%) T: @kylegriffin1 @CharlesMBlow Elizabeth Warren released a plan that looked strikingly similar to Kamala Harris’ preciously released plan. This in the wake of Warren releasing a housing plan that was eerily similar to Castro’s. There fixed it.

C: (0.995%) T: @DavMicRot @Scavino45 The Ohio shooter was anti-Trump, pro Elizabeth Warren, pro-Antifa. How did our President exacerbate this situation? This is a dangerous lie being told by the left-wing media who only want to blame Trump and his supporters
C: (0.986%) T: @BernieSanders If he did that then y'all would complain about him not showing up at El Paso! The Dayton Ohio shooter was a supporter of you and Elizabeth Warren! They listen to you guys stoke the fires of hate against our president and his supporters and then act on their aggression!
