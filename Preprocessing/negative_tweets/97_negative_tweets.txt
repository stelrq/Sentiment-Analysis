C: (0.545%) T: @fordrangermanfl @SamCrowley @shaunking @realDonaldTrump @ewarren @AOC So show me where Elizabeth Warren or AOC said anything about bar goers being infestations, rapists, murderers or laugh when someone suggests to shoot them.  Your false equivalence is disgusting.  Trump is a motivational speaker for White Nationals.

C: (0.998%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx @realDonaldTrump @JoaquinCastrotx   The shooter in Dayton used Elizabeth Warrens language before the shooting. Should we blame Elizabeth Warren? No. Because that would be stupid.  The ONLY person responsible for the shootings are the shooter.  Your hate, ugliness and lies don’t change that.
