C: (0.999%) T: @newscentermaine Liberal media has tried to blame POTUS for El Paso, but the Dayton killer was a left wing Democrat Antifa activist and a supporter of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. So, are they to blame for his actions, or does that rule only apply to Republicans?

C: (0.999%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Big difference.  Your words of hate inspired the El Paso shooter.  Never once has Bernie or Elizabeth Warren tweets/says hateful, racist rhetoric like you.

C: (1.000%) T: @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The Dayton killer did not quote Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren as directly influencing his decision to do what he did. The El Paso killer quoted Trump, created the word ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù out of guns, and wrote a manifesto using the same racist language that this administration uses.
