C: (0.991%) T: @atrupar Ohio shooters quotes of anti-police, anti-Ice and gun control are the same talking points used by democrats. He voted for hillary supported Bernie and Elizabeth Warren. El Paso shooter had the same Environmentalist views of democrats. Believe immigrants are hurting environment.

C: (1.000%) T: If you think it was wrong for Democrats to say the El Paso shooting was Trump‚Äôs fault,  Stop saying the Dayton shooting was Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs fault.   Don‚Äôt be a hypocrite.  These horrible acts of evil weren‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs fault, but the madmen pulling the trigger.
C: (1.000%) T: @EvanMillward @WCPO @POTUS Wannabe despots always equate opposition and self-defense with violent terrorism. It gets in their way. Trump routinely encourages hate and violence, something neither Bernie Sanders nor Elizabeth Warren have ever done. But Trump never mentions that.
C: (0.692%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx I never thought I‚Äôd see the day where a representative of the people of the country has resorted to doxxing the very people he is sworn to protect. This is pathetic and disgusting. Odd you‚Äôve left out he was a radical leftist who supported Elizabeth warren and socialism.

C: (0.535%) T: @ABC He was an Elizabeth Warren supporter. Mass murders are always democrats, liberals or socialists. Take their guns away.
C: (0.971%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Elizabeth Warren's (@ewarren) silence on this is deafening. The acts so horrific and the ties/motivation of her radical rhetoric so obvious, that it can only be assumed at this point that she condones the actions.

C: (0.980%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN The Dayton Ohio shooter's rampage wasn't politically motivated! He didn't quote Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders. He didn't have a manifesto citing phrases or comments they've used in their rallies. You're a coward. Except your part in this tragedy and unite the country.

C: (0.817%) T: @4annegs @reimagine_hemp If you haven't been on the clock, the current marching orders are that there's no such thing as White Supremacists - the Ohio shooter once tweeted that he likes Elizabeth Warren and how stabbings in California mean you can't stop mass shootings since you can't also ban knives.
