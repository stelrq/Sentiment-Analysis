C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ Maybe they should publish the names of people in Dayton that support Elizabeth Warren.  Of course they shouldn‚Äôt nor should the idiot in Texas have published names of people in El Paso who support Trump. There is less than zero correlation between the shooters and candidates
C: (0.508%) T: @kcbankruptcy @TeamTrump @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Do They have a video of Elizabeth Warren addressing supporters? Because the Dayton shooter was a Warren/ Sanders supporter.
