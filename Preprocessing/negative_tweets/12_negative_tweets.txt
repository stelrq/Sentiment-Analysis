C: (1.000%) T: @gtconway3d You are truly pathetic.  Let's talk about the Dayton shooter who was liberl, a fan of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and a devout Socialist.  Are you going to blame those 2 clowns equally?

C: (0.998%) T: @realDonaldTrump Amazing that they claim the President is provoking all these acts of violence, yet the Dayton shooter was an ardent fan of ELIZABETH WARREN and ANTIFA.  Also, we can blame the @HomelandDems for inflaming passions even more by implying people don't even have a right to SPEAK!
C: (0.508%) T: @reschafer What are your thoughts on Elizabeth Warren?
C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN So now that the Dayton shooter has been identified as an atheist, devil worshiping Elizabeth  Warren Democrat, is it still Trump's fault?
C: (0.748%) T: @McGrumpypaws @LeeHolly81 Ever seen anyone attack someone with a Bernie hat or an Elizabeth Warren hat?  No, we’re not crazy.
C: (0.995%) T: I agree, the #WhiteSupremacy narrative for killing is largely a shameful and simplistic, media-generated hoax or lie. E.g., The Dayton killer: "condemned right-wing conspiracy and indicated support for...Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren," says today's @WSJ #journalism #ethics https://t.co/lhhejvBHZj

C: (1.000%) T: @chach_nach @JoaquinCastrotx False equivalency. Elizabeth Warren is not on twitter dividing the country.  She is not inciting a racial divide.  She is not holding rallies inciting hatred against fellow Americans.  She is not using the power of her office to take healthcare away from Americans.  Blocked.
