Copied- Beto O'Rourke - Cory Booker - Elizabeth Warren, campaigning all over tv, while injured in hospitals - dead not buried, but their campaign goes on.  Beto is an absolute disgrace
C: (1.000%) T: Trump in El Paso: It’s a real shame, you hate to see it. But you have to admit you all had it coming. Anyone blaming me is irresponsible.  Trump in Dayton: All of you Democrats are to blame for this horrible tragedy, but mostly Elizabeth Warren.

C: (0.730%) T: @JulianCastro Who fanned the hate of the Antifa supporting socialist shooter in Dayton,OH? You? Elizabeth Warren? Beto? Bernie? Booker?
C: (0.986%) T: Even though I’m a hardcore @KamalaHarris supporter, you’ll never see me bash @ewarren. Ever. Elizabeth Warren is one of the very few candidates (Kamala Harris being one of them) that have explicit plans to divert federal resources into closing the racial wealth gap. #DemPrimary.

C: (1.000%) T: @JustTheFacts37 @armandodkos I don't. There's nothing embarrassing about donating to, say, Elizabeth Warren, as I have. And I personally doubt these Trump donors are embarrassed about donating to Trump, although they ought to be.

C: (1.000%) T: @robreiner so he called out white supremacists called out racism.   did not blame Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders for the left wing killer who hated ICE and was an Antifa supporter.  Rob we know you are dishonest when it comes to the president.  but please. quit spreading hate
C: (0.746%) T: The shooter in Dayton was a leftist. He supported Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. He was a socialist. He supported ANTIFA, a left-wing extremist hate group. SO, PRAY TELL, WHY IS DAYTON ANGRY WITH TRUMP?
C: (0.573%) T: @craiginphoenix @NBCNews Oh?? Like the Elizabeth Warren supporter who murdered 9 people in Dayton, OH last weekend??
C: (1.000%) T: @AnnCoulter Yes I do blame Trump’s hateful racist rants and smiling when his Cult says shoot them. Elizabeth Warren has never encouraged violence , hate, or murder. That is what Trump does at every rally and Tweet.
