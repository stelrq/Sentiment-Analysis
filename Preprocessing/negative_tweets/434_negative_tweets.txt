C: (0.990%) T: @TrisResists @OccupyDemocrats If he does something, radical leftists won't be able to "kill fascists" like the Dayton shooter.  They said the El Paso shooter was caused by Trump.  Does this mean the Dayton shooter was caused by Elizabeth Warren?  ü§î

C: (1.000%) T: @TrueGSC @thehill @realDonaldTrump @ewarren Elizabeth Warren isn't giving speeches where she laughs and make's jokes about the "panhandle" when someone screams "shoot them" to solve the immigrant problem and the Dayton shooter didn't post a manifesto parroting her speeches before going on a rampage.

C: (0.997%) T: @toner564 If we start assigning blame to Trump for this where does it stop? Is AOC responsible for the recent attack on an ICE facility? Is Elizabeth Warren responsible for Dayton? What about Bernie and the Scalise shooting? It's tired and illogical.
