C: (0.982%) T: @robreiner Dayton Ohio shooter wanted people who voted for Biden to die because he was for Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. He hated Trump. Do you think he got his violent tendencies from the Democrat party maybe?
C: (0.897%) T: @astromo1977 @CloydRivers Faulting the president for what one whacko did is ridiculous.  Are you going to blame Elizabeth Warren for the shooter in Ohio?  People need to be responsible for their actions.  The hate is very real on both sides of the aisle.  It needs to stop.

C: (1.000%) T: @olegrdnr @jennfranconews @OANN @RepCummings @MaxineWaters @CoryBooker Tell us what he lied about, blaming Trump for these shootings is a straight out lie. The Dayton shooter was a Democrat Elizabeth Warren Supporter who attended a Antifa rally in May. So who is to blame? Maybe Democrats, will you blame Warren? Should we blame Warren for the deaths?
C: (0.994%) T: @nightwhore98 Ok, so the Dayton shooting is the fault of Antifa,Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and democrats.
