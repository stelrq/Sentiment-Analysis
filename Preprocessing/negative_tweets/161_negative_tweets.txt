C: (0.999%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Elizabeth Warren does not use vile rhetoric to describe Immigrants. The El Paso shooter quoted your hate speech, your racist white nationalist beliefs. You can‚Äôt spin this, you are a racist, you seek to divide and bully the country #RacistInChief #RacistGOP

C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Wait, so if a White Supremacist, with a long history of Trump support, it's mental illness, but when a self-professed Satanist mentions he supports Elizabeth Warren, it's the guns and violence that caused the shooting?  You are one insane, hypocritical, and contradictory asshole
C: (0.508%) T: Completely Disagree. @SenWarren, Along with Every Member of the @DNC is Responsible for the Mass-Killings, by Inspiring Individuals to Murder-as-Option, through Building-Upon the Climate of Hate Established by @BarackObama and, @MichelleObama Since 2008. https://t.co/9MSD1bwLQJ

C: (1.000%) T: @TeaPainUSA Was it mental illness? violent video games? Bernie? Elizabeth Warren? I'm guessing he was a "lone Wolf", an isolated incident. Let's just move on from this anyway and talk about Chicago. Sweep this under the rug where all the other radical mass shooters are.
