C: (0.899%) T: @chuckwoolery I can say that about Elizabeth Warren. And Bernie Sanders. Beto O'Rourke.  Cory Booker. Actually I can say it about any Dem candidate that I've bothered to find out about. Even Biden. The difference is Trump is a terrible person and most of them aren't.
C: (0.720%) T: @ewarren And this is what the Democrats do ... lie, stir racism, create division. Elizabeth Warren sinks low as she struggles for power.

C: (0.998%) T: The Dayton killer had a Twitter account where he liked gun control, Elizabeth Warren and Socialism. The El Paso WalMart killer wrote a manifesto where he endorsed radical environmentalism.   Want to stop more mass murders? Enact mandatory gun confiscation to all Democrats.
