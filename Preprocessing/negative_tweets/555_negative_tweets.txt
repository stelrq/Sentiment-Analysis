C: (0.992%) T: @bobpi31415 @washingtonpost Youâ€™re an idiot. Is Elizabeth Warren to blame for the Dayton shooter? If your answer is no then you are a hypocrite and your words are meaningless.
C: (1.000%) T: With Elizabeth Warren's claim of "murder" of Michael Brown, I now conclude she is a danger to USA. Her distortion of the facts disqualifies her for any elective office. She will be  inciting a riot if some people take her seriously. Her mental stability is now in doubt with me.

C: (0.976%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren did not radicalize anyone. On the other hand, the El Paso killer, a confirmed white supremacist was radicalized by you. His manifesto was literally a replica of your speeches and tweeter feeds. You have blood on your hands!!
C: (0.775%) T: @AmbroseAndreano If you donâ€™t think Democrats have solutions, youâ€™re willfully ignorant of them. Hillary Clinton ran on her detailed plans for fixing things. Elizabeth Warren and several other candidates this year are doing the same. So, Iâ€™m sorry, but itâ€™s hard to take you seriously.
