C: (1.000%) T: @realDonaldTrump To neutralize #Trump’s bigotry rhetoric. #FOX put contributors that say, “The Dayton killer was a leftist, so does that mean we should blame Elizabeth Warren for his actions?” My question is, has Ms. Warren ever said anything that compares to #Trump’s hateful tone ever?

C: (0.999%) T: @brithume @seanmdav Is Elizabeth Warren’s evil and dishonest analysis of the Michael Brown shooting indicative of what passes as legal analysis from Harvard’s tenured law faculty?  I doubt the estimable Larry Tribe’s analysis is much different.
