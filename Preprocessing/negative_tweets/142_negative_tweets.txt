C: (0.981%) T: @rezaaslan Now do the Dayton shooter. His far-left ideology, inspired by @AOC's rhetoric (like the ICE bomber), his support for Elizabeth Warren. Are all liberals culpable? People like you are the REAL problem. Stop spreading hate. If you support terrorist ideology you are a terrorist. End.
C: (1.000%) T: @DailyCaller These sick Democrats will never be satisfied. Where is Elizabeth Warren condemning her supporter for the attacks in Ohio? where is Bernie condemning the attacks on the Republicans by his supporter? They only push against Republicans and never take responsibility for their actions
