C: (0.982%) T: @BarackObama Why don't we just blame the shooter. The shooter in Ohio was an Elizabeth Warren fan. Do we blame her for that shooting? You did more to divide this country than anyone. Blacks against police. You and your wife hated this country.  So you have no room to talk. Do we blame you?

C: (0.694%) T: @JoaquinCastrotx Time to file #classactionlawsuit against @JoaquinCastrotx for publishing information &amp; inciting violence against those on the list. #FireJoaquinCastro. His rhetoric is exactly what caused a pro gun control Elizabeth Warren supporter to do what he did this weekend. https://t.co/2WUHfQRrpY
C: (1.000%) T: @JoeBiden @ChrisMurphyCT Since both shooters are left wing trump haters I wonder who's rhetoric set them off. How big is this left wing White supremacist problem? One is a Green new deal environmentalist and the other loves Elizabeth Warren. How do we stop their godless wicked followers.?
