C: (1.000%) T: @JohnCornyn @WSJ it's like these republicans are blindfolded and looking for where they can be outraged - stop pretending you're stupid - if Elizabeth Warren ever said we were being INVADED by republican reptilian humanoid hybrids - then sure - blame Warren. My god you people are so fucking dumb.
C: (0.703%) T: @JordanUhl @GoAngelo What‚Äôs funny is you closet commies ignoring the closet commie shooter in Dayton who was all about communists, gun control and Elizabeth Warren.
C: (0.565%) T: @JulianCastro You mean the Elizabeth Warren supporter? Why don‚Äôt you and your media buddies mention this? It‚Äôs not her fault just like the El Paso shooter wasn‚Äôt President Trump‚Äôs.

C: (0.999%) T: @DrJasonJohnson I'm a @SenWarren fan... It seems to me that when she is attacked she turns the conversation to what we can do for the people and what her plan is. Elizabeth Warren supporters don't have to scream or yell ü§∑...that's just more noise. #elizabethwarren2020
