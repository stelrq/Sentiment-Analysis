C: (1.000%) T: "I don't blame Elizabeth Warren and I don't blame Bernie Sanders."  Our President chooses to take the political high road, regarding the Dayton Shooting. It's a shame the media refuses to do the same with El Paso. https://t.co/aGx4XFyTCT
C: (0.999%) T: Democrat Mayor Nan Whaley, of Dayton, OH, casually predicts another mass shooting tomorrow and Friday.  Sen BROWN D OH beside her blames Trump’s “racism”.

C: (0.997%) T: @coletrain_tnt @acalltoapathy @MyPlace4U @kevinomccarthy @michi83 @TXAG The El Paso shooter said he had his views prior to Trump not to mention they were very leftist views. The Ohio shooter was an antifa supporter, supported Elizabeth Warren, was for gun control. Intimidating, bully if the same were being done a Dem all hell would break loose

C: (0.998%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders don’t tweet racist sentiments and stand in front of crowds advocating violence against immigrants. That’s the difference.
C: (0.999%) T: @IanWolfe20 If trump tweeted a list of Elizabeth Warren donors and their businesses y’all would be screaming that he’s inciting violence. Stop
C: (0.832%) T: @realDonaldTrump @OANN The difference is Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren don't incite violence. The Dayton shooter wasn't motivated by racism and hatred like the El Paso shooter. YOU are the one that incites violence in white nationalist psychos with your racist tweets and Redneck Rallies.
