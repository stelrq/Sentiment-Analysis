C: (0.992%) T: @AOC President Trump is no more to blame for this shooting then Bernie Sanders was for the shooting on the baseball field of Steve Scalies. Or was for Obama for Sandy Hook.   The Ohio shooter was anti Trump, pro Elizabeth Warren, pro socialism, and pro Antifa.

C: (0.980%) T: @DrShayPhD @DineshDSouza The left used Marxist tactics to divide us! Obama really got this ramped up during his presidency and they are continuing where he left off! For example, Elizabeth Warren started tweeting about Michael Brown and said he was “murdered” she is stoking racial division! Unbelievable!
C: (0.857%) T: @oliverdarcy But please, continue ignoring Biden saying he was VP during the Parkland shooting, or Elizabeth Warren purporting the "hands up, don't shoot" lie that was debunked extensively, oh great selective outrage reporter.
C: (1.000%) T: @thumps3343 @ByronYork Elizabeth Warren is a race monger... it’s nothing more than pandering to the minority voters.   Btw if the so called college bound Mr Brown wouldn’t have strong armed robbed a small store owner...the incident would have never happened...
C: (1.000%) T: SEEING THAT I SUPPORT WOMEN. I beg women my age and younger to distance themselves from the SUPERFICIALLY, CHEERFUL bitter, spiteful, and HATE FILLED HIllary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris.

C: (0.999%) T: Trump accuses Clinton of murder, Elizabeth Warren accuses cop of murdering Michael Brown, Kamala Harris accuses Trump of supplying the El Paso ammo. When did murder accusations become presidential prerequisites? #Epstein #ElPaso #Ferguson

C: (0.994%) T: President Trump doesn’t blame Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders for the Ohio shooting. We’re dealing with some really sick people. https://t.co/h7BpZefzS9
C: (1.000%) T: @joseph604 @ABC "I don't blame Elizabeth Warren and I don't blame Bernie Sanders. I don't blame anybody -- these are sick people," the president said talking about the gunmen.
C: (0.981%) T: @Castro4Congress @BillMillerBarBQ @HistoricPearl Maxine Waters encourages harassment on Trump supporters in public.  The 2 gunmen R DemocRAT supporters. 1 of them is a Elizabeth Warren supporter. A Bernie Sanders supporter, shot at Repubicans in a baseball field. DemocRATS R the ones that is spreading the hatred.  Not Trump.
