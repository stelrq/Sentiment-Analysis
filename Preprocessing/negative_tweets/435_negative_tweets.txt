C: (0.568%) T: @BetoORourke The shooter at Dayton left nine dead was left leaning, pro-gun control, anti-second amendment, and an Elizabeth Warren supporter, but I can’t seem to find any tweets of yours bashing her for this coward’s own decision? Stop using tragic events to push agendas to take away rights.

C: (0.995%) T: @wildebees Marxism is on the rise in the US. A coup has just been averted. Paedophilia amongst elitist liberals is being covered up by a totalitarian media.
