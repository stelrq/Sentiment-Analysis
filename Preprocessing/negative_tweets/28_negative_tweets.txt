C: (1.000%) T: @jayrosen_nyu @rezaaslan If Trump is responsible for San Antonio, then Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Dayton OH.  There is hateful rhetoric on both sides.  The left attaches the word ‚Äúwhite‚Äù to nationalism accusing people who dont want socialism as being racist.  That is divisive.
